	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,230
so we're talking about free

00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:09,000
communications and messaging today's

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,540
session I'm going to quickly go through

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,630
some slides and some pictures I'm going

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,930
to show how they relate to the Debian

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,170
project and particularly the next

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,130
release we easy has some new some new

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,529
features for voice over IP and and then

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,570
it's going to open up a little bit for

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:35,250
some discussion and questions as well

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:38,100
and voice over IP goes beyond Debian

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,270
itself and is obviously you have to

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,489
interoperate with with other systems so

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,760
I mean I'm keen on things like soft

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,340
phones on Android and I've worked on

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,739
things that work on Windows as well but

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:58,410
the focus of most of what you're going

00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:03,719
to see is on Debian so this is an

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:06,659
outline of the session so just looking

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,570
at the at where we are today and how we

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,430
got there

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:14,610
mail email has become tremendously

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,840
successful everyone's using it it's it's

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,600
based on open standards like SMTP you

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,020
can see that in the in the heading mail

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,509
servers are installed by default in in

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,030
most linux systems on your debian you

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,579
you get exome or where you might swap

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,560
that for postfix it used to be send mail

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,829
but you'd always end up with one of them

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,869
when you install a Linux system that's

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,970
probably been one of the reasons why

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,710
email has taken hold is because it's

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,689
always been on systems from the

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:51,659
beginning so a trivial amount of effort

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:55,560
is necessary you need a static IP

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,619
address MX record you can change maybe

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,100
two or three lines of config file and

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,780
start filling up your mailbox with spam

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,780
that you you never wanted

00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:15,710
VoIP servers have not been deployed by

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,980
default typically and they're not nearly

00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,360
as easy to configure either so

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,720
distributions that offer packages they

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,760
like Debian offers asterisk and still

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,790
leaves a lot of setting up as well so

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,220
it's not installed by default and if you

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,950
go and get it with we have to get you

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,740
have to do a lot of the effort to set it

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,620
up it does come with a default

00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:42,020
configuration for a demo but that has to

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:47,210
be adapted you can't just go live with

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:49,640
that so the bottom line is that the free

00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:52,400
software and open standards have not

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,850
become entrenched we don't have a an

00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:01,610
open-source equivalent to Firefox in the

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:04,250
in the VoIP world so asterisk you know

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,580
takes a lot of setup effort I mean I've

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:11,690
got asterisk systems with dozens of

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,630
config files for every protocol for

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:18,950
different classes of user and gateway

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:22,610
connection and the real pain I haven't

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,580
seen any voice over IP system that

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:28,600
automatically gives VoIP to all the UNIX

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:32,120
users on a machine once again the email

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,090
servers will typically turn your UNIX

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,730
users into mailboxes just out of the box

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,730
it's all automatic and none of the voice

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:46,750
over IP proj products have tried to do

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:49,580
that there have been a number of legacy

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,340
traditions like telephone numbering and

00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,350
that these are important like on many

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,020
devices you don't have a full keyboard

00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:00,320
so you do need to preserve these

00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:03,470
traditions but they have slowed down the

00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,250
adoption of new techniques another one

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:10,040
is emergency dialing so depending on

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,300
which country you're in it might be 911

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:17,799
or 999 or one one two in

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:20,590
Europe these things of all have been

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,930
factors in the slow deployment of a

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,000
universal VoIP infrastructure email

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,910
never had to deal with things like this

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,250
there's no emergency

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,860
you know fax number in most countries

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,250
that it email never had to compete with

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,920
something like that

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,350
the two major protocols to choose from

00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,510
right at this moment sip and jabber and

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,660
even that is a dilemma for people like

00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:49,090
Google has gone with jabber

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,690
Microsoft has gone with sip for some of

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:55,960
their products a lot of the physical

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:59,440
desk phones are based on sip without

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,080
jabber support but Google is huge in

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,290
their jabber so so both protocols are

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:10,030
very relevant right now there's no

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:12,970
definite winner and that has been a huge

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,910
headache but people have often embarked

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,580
on a VoIP project and and ended up

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,710
pulling their hair out because someone

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,240
will take a VoIP phone into their house

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:27,070
and their router will mangle the the

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,100
signaling packets or it will lose the

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:33,550
audio in one direction it's caused a lot

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:40,990
of frustration email doesn't have those

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:43,810
sort of headaches with net so Skype and

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,740
and now more recently we've seen viber

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:50,110
have have seized the day they've has

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,570
become very prominent if you ask people

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:56,110
about voice over IP they will talk to

00:05:52,570 --> 00:06:02,080
you about Skype is there anyone here who

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:06,070
has not used Skype yep okay now keep

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:10,360
your hand up if you if no one has ever

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:13,300
asked you to talk to them on skype okay

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,770
so we've all come across this and we're

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,780
going to touch on this again later but

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,450
there's a there's a certain amount of

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,160
peer pressure in in communications that

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,400
doesn't exist with with other

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,700
open-source endeavors with free software

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,260
people won't worry about whether you

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,120
Tsing Linux but when you actually need

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:38,330
to talk to them you need to agree on a

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:41,550
common platform in the corporate world

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,650
Microsoft Lync is is gaining traction in

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,080
many of the big corporates that I've

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:50,610
been working with I've seen link

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,220
projects getting underway I haven't seen

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,720
one that has been successful yet but

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,480
that doesn't mean they've failed it just

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,000
means that they're taking their time and

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,070
that at some point you know a lot of

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,630
them are going to be stuck on this and

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,760
people are going to see this as the

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:12,030
default in the corporate world like

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:28,170
Outlook it just wait we need to get user

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:30,840
microphone so just hold a microphone as

00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:36,750
an office is linked office communicator

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:39,840
yes it's had various names and so you

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,700
will notice that there are products like

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,950
sip phones that have been made for

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:48,630
earlier versions of link when it

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:51,960
operated under another name and most of

00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,300
the SIP phones often like compatibility

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,970
features which are necessary because

00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:01,130
Microsoft makes extensions to the

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:04,680
protocol another point to think about is

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:08,460
who has seen the recent Facebook attack

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,070
on email on email addresses so everyone

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:15,540
know what I'm talking about

00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:19,860
that in contact lists people typically

00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:22,320
have their friends email addresses on

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:26,760
Facebook and they have their own email

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,920
address Facebook is trying to get people

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:33,120
to use their Facebook ID as an email

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,729
address at facebook.com/ and at some

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,880
point recently they they somehow

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,230
switched off or hid the non Facebook

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,960
email addresses

00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:45,030
so that if you look at a profile and you

00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,360
see the Facebook email address that you

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:50,970
never knew you wanted but you've got it

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,610
and you have to go in there manually and

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,340
put back your own email address if you

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,280
are a Facebook user and on top of that

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,500
I've read that the people who are

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:06,120
running the Facebook app which

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,220
integrates on their handheld devices got

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,860
so excited about this that actually

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,930
modified their contact list outside of

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,730
Facebook but their their phone contact

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,700
list actually started picking up the

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,590
Facebook email addresses and losing the

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,440
other email addresses which caused a lot

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,470
of frustration so but you could see

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,040
where these big companies are going with

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:32,610
this you know they want to standardize

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,690
the user on a particular ID and then

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,270
they want to bring all the

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,580
communications through that single ID

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,610
for their various reasons and we'll look

00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,430
at those reasons in a moment but this is

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:48,150
scary stuff and that Facebook example

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:50,640
gives you a very it's a wake-up call

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:56,130
about the lengths that they will go to

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:59,700
to get hold of your communications so

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:03,630
real-world examples in other domains in

00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:10,380
technology you've got the encryption of

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:13,020
DVDs you've got HDMI using DRM to

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:17,400
protect media to stop duplication of

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:20,160
media you've got secure boot coming to

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:24,570
the PC and to stop you running other

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:30,090
software I mean what can we anticipate

00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:32,460
next in voice over IP with Skype so

00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,350
widely deployed and with link getting a

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,680
foothold in the corporate market could

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:41,520
we say a similar trend that DRM could

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,630
come to voice over IP and how would that

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,630
look if that happened

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:56,730
is it already the case with Skype not

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,940
quite it is a proprietary and encrypted

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,610
system but it doesn't really link out to

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,920
other systems very effectively they

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,710
haven't so tightly bound it with link

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,620
but if link becomes established in

00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,330
Europe so your fortune 500 companies and

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,270
they can all call each other through

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:18,180
link and the member of the public wants

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,040
to call big you know corporate call

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:24,420
center or something and they can do that

00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,830
for free through Skype or maybe they

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,660
will have to go to their traditional

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,700
phone company and pay for that and

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,530
there'll be no other option that's the

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,650
type of thing that we should be

00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,360
concerned about is that the the market

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,640
will be steered in this direction

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,010
another way that they could steer the

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,530
market is with things like emergency

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,450
calling which is currently a bit

00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,780
difficult over the internet and each

00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:51,090
country has got to a different stage and

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:55,370
trying to support emergency calls over

00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:57,930
voice over IP but if you look at the

00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:01,920
relationships of governments and big

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:04,890
companies you know Microsoft may or

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,080
another vendor may try to propose a

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,030
proprietary protocol to solve that

00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:18,030
problem and that could be very dangerous

00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:21,180
to open and free protocols so DRM like

00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:24,510
mechanisms may extend the the barriers

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,300
that already exist with Skype so you may

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,000
see a few big companies that agree to

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,190
work together and even more than they do

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,070
now at the moment they're like islands

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,390
like viber and Skype separate but if a

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,630
few of these companies stitched

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:42,660
something up together using some sort of

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:48,630
a DRM mechanism and then it becomes a

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:51,390
lot more dangerous just about that we

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,780
have things seen things proposal like

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:57,390
that to prioritize certain types of

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,430
Internet content to others with regards

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,010
to others like video should be have a

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,400
higher priority than text-based things

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,710
and

00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,930
if we see some stuff like Skype should

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,360
be more privatized than the rest we are

00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,610
also in the same type of situation yes

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,010
there's a real risk that when you

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,520
combine technologies like deep packet

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:20,610
inspection and so on then an ISP could

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,790
recognize Skype packets and they could

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:26,370
offer Microsoft a deal to prioritize

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:30,270
their air traffic on the network which

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:34,320
is another attack on freedom and choice

00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:36,390
of what product you use and I mean this

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,360
list could go on and on all the

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:42,660
different ways that that that open and

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,630
free solutions could could be put in

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,900
danger advertising has come up recently

00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:51,750
there was some talk about skype

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,790
displaying advertisements during audio

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:57,420
calls so you would see an advertisement

00:13:53,790 --> 00:14:00,000
in the video window if you are not using

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,010
video I don't know if it's already

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,150
switched on but it has been discussed

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:08,520
publicly but it may not be in your face

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,830
like that they may actually use more

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,090
sophisticated mechanisms and I'm going

00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,090
to touch on those in a moment

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:22,410
corporates may be able to to opt out of

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,930
having advertising for their callers so

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,480
if you call your bank and you might not

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:31,290
see advertising you get the free call

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:34,190
with a proprietary VoIP system but you

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:38,010
know the bank might have a deal with the

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:43,350
the vendor to to exclude advertising on

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:45,030
those calls and calls between corporates

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,190
but we don't know which way this is

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,640
going to go now because it hasn't really

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,370
taken off yet but there's a real danger

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,010
that that could also depend heavily on

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:58,740
on link that if a lot of them start

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:02,070
using link and a lot of governments as

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:05,190
well then then people will not be able

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:08,010
to make a credible case to use something

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,980
else so if other solutions don't

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,710
actually get in there first and if these

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,360
big boys get established then it becomes

00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,970
a lot more dangerous

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,740
they can't do that retrospectively with

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,670
email now I mean we've had some fears

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,740
about domainkeys and other techniques

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,560
that have though some companies have

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:32,850
tried to introduce to email but they

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:36,000
haven't completely stopped open source

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,920
and free solutions here we're at a

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,170
different point because the open and

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,060
free solutions don't have a strong

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:49,130
foothold yet I'm not sure if you can see

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:52,050
this can everyone read that at the back

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:55,110
No okay

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:58,940
so what you can see here down the bottom

00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:02,130
that big bar basically represents your

00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:06,750
single sign-on your say your Microsoft

00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:09,480
passport or your facebook login your

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,910
cookies that follow you everywhere and

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,450
what you've got in the big box on the

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:18,870
left is your your soft phone or whatever

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:21,690
that may be your non free product and

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:25,649
then these two little arrows in the top

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,920
arrow we've got a system analyzing your

00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:30,690
speech to extract the words and these

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,019
systems already exist so they're

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:37,440
extracting what you say in whatever

00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:40,290
language you choose to speak and the

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,100
other arrow is analyzing your emotions

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:46,260
and other context and they can do this

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,899
as well they can detect whether you're

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,399
happy or sad if you're happy you know

00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:53,130
they want to sell you a holiday if

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:57,029
you're if you're afraid they'll try and

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,709
sell new car insurance or something and

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:05,069
this all goes into a data warehouse

00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:07,410
somewhere this then drives some logic

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,169
for positioning advertisements and on

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,260
the right you've got your your web

00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:15,689
browsing and your other online

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,939
activities not just during the time that

00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:19,919
you're on a phone call but maybe for the

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:23,819
rest of the day or the rest of the week

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,650
so they build up a picture of your stage

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,120
during a phone call and then they can

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,150
use that to influence

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,760
what advertising you'll see they can

00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,340
link all of that together using a single

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,880
sign-on and other mechanisms that track

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,580
you so this is serious stuff because it

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:49,020
allows advertisers to target things much

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:51,470
more closely than ever before just to

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,680
break out of that for a moment

00:17:51,470 --> 00:18:02,720
so in the browser here and this is a

00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:04,770
publication from the I Triple E from

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,820
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:12,980
it's been around for about six years but

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:14,870
this basically concerns at analyzing

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:20,280
[Music]

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:26,309
emotions in speech to understand how you

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:28,679
react to different brands so you can

00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:30,960
imagine you know that this is not the

00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,080
only application of this technology but

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,900
if you type this into Google um yeah

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,640
recognition of emotions in speech you

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:48,270
will find a lot of stuff has been done

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:53,700
over quite a few years now so

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:56,970
communications it's very pervasive every

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,429
person in every business has some sort

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:02,040
of communication system and techno a

00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:06,270
technological solution whether it's a

00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:10,470
mobile phone their email maybe a

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:12,420
combination of things not only that but

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,620
they get a lot more angry if it's not

00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,100
working

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:22,530
compared to just an outage of their

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:25,530
internet browsing as I mentioned before

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,720
with a operating system you don't have

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,610
so much pressure from other people I

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,460
mean I've worked in offices where I

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,820
could use Linux and even though the guy

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,040
sitting next to me was running Windows

00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,809
I've been able to use Thunderbird or I

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,749
staff to connect to

00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:45,029
Exchange Server even when the guy next

00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:47,609
to me is using Outlook but with

00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:49,499
communications you have a bit more

00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:51,570
pressure to use something that's

00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:54,659
compatible that's why we all get these

00:19:51,570 --> 00:20:01,109
requests to use Skype or is typically

00:19:54,659 --> 00:20:03,749
Skype that people mention and and it

00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:06,330
it's just a very dangerous area that if

00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:08,909
if we fail to address the concerns about

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:13,169
the quality of the service or if we fail

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:16,019
to attack the the net that peer pressure

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:19,229
issue and to provide solutions that can

00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:21,929
be widespread then you know then open

00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:29,239
source and free solutions just won't get

00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:32,070
a foot in the door so what can we do so

00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:34,950
here I've got a list of some suggestions

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:38,629
and and I'd mentioned some packages that

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,629
already exist in in wasy

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,649
supporting both protocols the SIP and

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,049
jabber and I think that if you choose

00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:49,589
one or the other then you won't have a

00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:56,070
hundred percent coverage there are some

00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:58,019
questions a microphone microphone I'd

00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:01,649
like to add something before you go

00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:03,239
further I missed the first slide but I

00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:06,539
think you didn't talk about also the

00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:08,009
issue of the lack of encryption or at

00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:10,339
least an - an encryption that could

00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:14,099
guarantee that their communication is

00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:17,149
protected and confidential which is I

00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:22,289
think is more much more worrisome than

00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:25,249
advertisement yeah encryption is an

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:28,859
issue it's not the fundamental issue of

00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:30,210
the talk today but a lot of what we're

00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:32,639
going to go through does actually

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,919
support it and it is on this slide as

00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:37,070
well it's further Daniel's a TLS is

00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,019
grayed out at the moment

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,279
but we will get to the encryption that

00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:44,519
the little demo

00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:48,559
coming as well it is very relevant but

00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:50,999
it's not fundamental to having a free

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,630
solution so okay I mention this because

00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:55,750
recently I heard up

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:58,690
Skype integrating some technology to be

00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:02,080
able to make possible and easy to

00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:05,200
governments to wiretap calls yes well

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,180
they already do that with with GSM

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,310
networks I mean most people have the

00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,540
perception that when they take out their

00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:15,970
mobile phone and they call their friend

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,490
so if I call Hector I might believe that

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:23,440
my call is encrypted all the way to his

00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:27,690
phone is that true no it's encrypted to

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,760
the tower and then the tower decrypt it

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,290
listens to it if necessary and then

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,560
encrypts it again and sends it out to

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:37,660
his phone so most people have the

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,730
perception that it's encrypted from

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,010
their phone to the phone that they're

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:48,310
calling that there's nothing in the

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:52,030
middle that's it's not true so so just

00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:59,970
going back to the slide so sippin jabber

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:59,970
in parallel another question microphone

00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:11,500
you didn't mention mumbles protocols

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:13,180
something that is in use and isn't

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,240
either simple jabber as I understand it

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:20,740
it's not as widespread but it is

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,810
relevant so yeah what we'll do so I'll

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,330
go through or do you want to drop me to

00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:28,030
stop for a minute and you can tell us it

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,740
no we can go through a bit more detail

00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:34,510
for those who don't know well it will be

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:37,170
excellent yeah okay go ahead oh I'll

00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:40,750
come back to that

00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:42,460
the other issue to maximize the chance

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,840
that two people can speak to each other

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:49,090
is to have as many codecs as possible

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,500
that if if you have different codecs and

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,530
this is common with open source

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,710
solutions is many of them have the 64

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,930
kilobit codec but they all have

00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,440
different low bitrate codecs some have

00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:04,840
GSM some have Speaks you actually need

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,190
to have as many of them as possible to

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,240
have

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,860
excess plug-and-play solutions I

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,250
mentioned before you don't have that

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:17,010
with asterisk but now we have packages

00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,050
like repro which is for sip and a

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:21,660
jeopardy has been around for a while

00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:24,480
it's web-based it's easy you just

00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,070
install the package and do a few

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:32,190
settings and you have something you can

00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:35,790
use net there is a solution now that the

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,950
only requirement for for ice and turn to

00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:41,760
work is that all your devices need to

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:46,410
support it so as long as you can use

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:49,620
like modern sip phones or jabber devices

00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:52,080
or soft phones this will work and it

00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,540
seems to be the only strong way to deal

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:59,120
with in that issue in the package for

00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:59,120
that is this reciprocate turn server

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:08,250
phone spam I mean if you imagine all the

00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:12,090
the spam you get in email who gets more

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:14,540
than 10 spam messages in a day can can

00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:19,260
you imagine if those were phone calls

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:21,930
yeah okay and this is a real issue and

00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:24,390
it's another reason that that voice over

00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:29,310
IP has been held back is this fear of

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:34,110
spam impersonation as well as

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:36,480
interception of calls TLS with mutual

00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:39,390
authentication can address a lot of

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,550
those problems and because you know

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,820
who's calling you and because it's

00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:47,310
signed by a certificate and not only

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,620
that but you can implement access

00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:54,350
controls and other mechanisms you can

00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:57,810
use statistical methods to identify

00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,460
patterns from spammers if they need to

00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:02,340
have some certificate to get on the

00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:06,180
network you can recognize when when

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:10,020
they're using that certificate in legacy

00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:12,330
traditions like phone numbers so enum is

00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,550
one way to address the requirement to

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,450
keep using phone numbers or to support

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:21,160
them

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:23,110
this package the dl said LDAP enum if

00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,350
you have phone numbers in a LDAP

00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:28,900
directory it exposes them all over ena

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,870
instantly so any other voice over IP

00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:35,590
application that can use enum can use

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:38,020
your LDAP directory for routing so

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:44,020
that's a very quick wind installing that

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:46,120
package this is just a quick diagram the

00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:49,120
main thing to notice here is that the

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,990
two phones at the bottom right calling

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:57,040
each other on the local network RTP

00:26:52,990 --> 00:27:00,310
stream is going within the network

00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,500
between them for the phone on the left

00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:05,650
the one that's out on the internet

00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:08,260
somewhere his RTP stream goes through

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,570
that turn server at the top and that's

00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:13,360
how we deal with the net issue and you

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:15,910
notice in this case if you can read the

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,630
IP addresses that the guy on the left

00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:22,360
actually has the same IP address on some

00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:25,630
other net as one of the phones in the

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:29,410
office but for the turn server that's no

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:33,910
problem but it would be a problem with

00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:35,730
some older sip solutions if we go back

00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:40,150
and forth you can see the jabber

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:44,050
solution is very very similar but the

00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:49,780
jabber system can also use the same turn

00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:54,910
server to to handle the connection of

00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:58,150
NAT users so so that's that's all that's

00:27:54,910 --> 00:28:00,040
another victory for open standards you

00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:04,630
don't have to deploy two of these things

00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,860
one of them is enough when this is

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:08,830
putting them all together

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:11,500
you'll notice that the SIP server in the

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,630
jabber server they can both use the same

00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,550
certificate as well so you don't have to

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:19,290
buy different certificates for each

00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:22,540
server and that's working with the

00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:25,270
single turn server for both of them you

00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:29,410
have a soft phone using jabber on the

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:30,190
top left know the throw the top right

00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,350
and

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:36,519
bottom right you have a desk phone using

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:42,879
SEP and you have various users out in

00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:48,159
the wild so free software and free

00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:50,440
communication say they go together the

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:55,870
DRM like things there they're a real

00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:58,090
threat we've already gone through half

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:06,879
an hour so what I'm gonna do so I'm

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:12,429
going to skip over some of this and just

00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:17,019
go over here to two quick demonstrations

00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:21,279
this is the each a birdy server and it's

00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:23,500
a nice web interface after you install

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,480
the package you just go in and you add

00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,120
your users you need to set up a

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,610
certificate and start adding your users

00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,009
and then you've got jabber system and

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:36,250
that's federated so when you add your

00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:39,789
friend on Google Talk they see your full

00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:45,000
domain with your email address rather

00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:48,519
than a Google Talk user ID the other

00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,299
demonstration is repro the sip proxy

00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,340
which is very similar a bit for set

00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:56,889
that's not installed and so we don't see

00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:00,370
anything here and so we're going to see

00:29:56,889 --> 00:30:02,970
if if it actually installs in the middle

00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:11,740
of giving a presentation without

00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:14,309
breaking something so install the yes I

00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,309
can do that

00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,300
is that better

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,770
is that better yep okay so I've just

00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:35,700
installed the library package this Lib

00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:42,480
reciprocate and we install the let's

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:50,640
install that turn server package that's

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:54,150
installed in the latest version of the

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,650
package as their contract files have

00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:59,549
moved a little bit but they're largely

00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:02,010
like this so we just setup IP address

00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:05,850
here and then we have that turn server

00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:11,370
you'll notice the default password here

00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:13,830
I'd recommend changing that so this one

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:18,799
I'm actually gonna remove that now you

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,799
can all see my my hostname there

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,029
what was that package name return the

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,880
actual package is not named return

00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:33,570
anymore is it it wasn't appropriate for

00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:40,700
the archive so it's now reciprocate turn

00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:40,700
server but the other one is the repro

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:50,870
proxy sip this one also has a config

00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,870
file

00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:04,150
you get to see some more passwords here

00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:14,530
just admin is the default and the port

00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:18,820
is 50 80 see if we're lucky you log in

00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:22,390
as admin you can add some users you

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:26,140
should add some domains first my domain

00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:36,550
comm let me just put that on the default

00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:41,580
port add a user and put Daniel and there

00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:45,450
it is and if I successfully configure my

00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:48,640
phone then it will appear on this list

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:51,010
so those are some of the quickest ways

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,730
to get started with sip and jabber on

00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:56,080
debian and so those packages should be

00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,450
there in in wheezy

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,500
very much in the form that you've just

00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:06,610
seen as to look at it from another angle

00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:14,950
and this is the bloomie called dialer

00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:18,450
for Android and you can see here a

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:23,230
demonstration of dialing with enum and

00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:26,560
have selected a contact and the dialer

00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:29,080
has actually found an enum record for

00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:34,330
Bob's phone number so that's the first

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:36,900
record you see with enum is via sip 5060

00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:40,420
net so it can place the call for free

00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:43,150
using that the next option is it's found

00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:47,470
Bob's email address which you see there

00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:50,080
and it's realized that he has a sip

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:53,380
server for Lumi call org

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,750
and so it offers you the option of

00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:59,140
calling that email address as if it's a

00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:02,470
sip address there just works that out if

00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:05,230
the domain doesn't have the SIP address

00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:07,500
it won't it won't show up as an option

00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:11,250
so the user should not be confused

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,580
and then it can dial through the mobile

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:17,010
network and you pay for the call

00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:21,240
just let it continue and so I've chosen

00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:26,250
the e number it it dials the number and

00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:29,129
in this case it's doing it's warning us

00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:33,359
the call is not secure there it is it's

00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:37,010
done said RTP and set up and it's now

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:40,560
secured those two words you see they're

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:43,230
both in both users on each end of the

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:48,060
call should say the same two words and

00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:49,919
the security of ZRTP is based on two

00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:53,310
things that you should both see the same

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,530
words and that you should recognize the

00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:59,340
other person's voice so it doesn't work

00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:01,170
if you call you know the airline and you

00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,890
get someone in a call center who you've

00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:07,490
never spoken to before because you don't

00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:11,010
have any way to recognize their voice so

00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:13,590
said RTP gives you these two words and

00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:15,900
if you hear the voice and you recognize

00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,180
it and they read out those two words to

00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,580
you then you know you have a secure line

00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,280
it's based on a diffi Hellman key

00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:28,980
exchange

00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:32,630
so that's looma call so that's that's

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:38,070
the end of the presentations I'd like to

00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:43,820
have questions yes security here you

00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:43,820
mean security as him as I'm talking to

00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:50,970
yes and using the voice authentication

00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:55,350
you're verifying the identity of the

00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:58,890
person and and on top of that it's also

00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:03,180
encrypting the call with AES so all the

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:06,720
packets are signed with a digest so that

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:09,270
they're not so there's no impersonation

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,530
and they're all encrypted with a I EES

00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,530
so it's encrypted

00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:25,770
I would like to point out a couple of

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,290
things about the whole topic well first

00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,840
of all here I will say immediately that

00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,490
I don't think anybody will ever read

00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,830
those two words to anybody who they're

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:39,750
calling I don't think that's possible

00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:41,340
for real users I think any solution that

00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,850
tries to do something like that is gonna

00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:48,660
fail be honest but independent if that

00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:51,360
em you seem to be making the point that

00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:54,180
the probably the problem have currently

00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,940
with communications is based only on the

00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,970
difficulty of creating a sip serve work

00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,340
of your innate chatter but I don't agree

00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:06,120
with that I think the biggest problem we

00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:09,510
have is first of all that soft phones

00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:11,280
are in general not very good that when

00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,950
people try a free soft phone it will not

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,730
work well even though the there is

00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:21,510
plenty of SIP providers that give decent

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:25,710
decent product no sorry different design

00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:27,750
services so I think the biggest issue to

00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:32,700
work on is having really well working

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:34,860
soft phones and then also another thing

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,240
as I said before the security concern I

00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,830
think it's growing it's growing in many

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,420
people that is not technically oriented

00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:45,660
especially after what happened with

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:48,180
Facebook and other stuff so that's I

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:51,630
think is something that to concentrate

00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,240
on if we want to make those people

00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,520
switch to free software but but if you

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,850
are if we are not doing this the

00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,530
security of finality stop priorities I

00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:05,820
think you're not getting these people

00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:07,410
and I seen your graphs your RTP your RTP

00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,120
connections were not secure you were

00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,910
only caring about authentication and I

00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,230
don't care about indication I care about

00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:16,410
encryption okay

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:20,400
the diagrams that we looked at before

00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:22,650
were very simple so I didn't go into the

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,810
SRTP simply means we don't have a lot of

00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,420
time to do that

00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:29,250
if you look at the open telecom stored

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:33,110
org website you'll see it's covered in

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:34,790
more depth there's ed RTP itself the the

00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,820
two words and the diffie-hellman key

00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:42,200
exchange and they come from Phil

00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:44,300
Zimmermann the guy behind the PGP and so

00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,310
it is popular this is just one

00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,120
implementation it's not something like

00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,840
created and I don't take any credit for

00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,210
ya

00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,080
with anyhow does anyone else have

00:38:53,210 --> 00:39:01,730
anything

00:38:54,080 --> 00:39:05,330
I remember reading once something's that

00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:07,160
was saying that when you use Skype you

00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:09,350
are actually going through somebody

00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:14,120
who's running a Windows version of Skype

00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:17,360
and having set up his computer well so

00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:20,870
it's not nothing I mean it's just has no

00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,670
firewall on their house and so in a

00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,560
sense you get a good quality phone call

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,980
because you are running in some sort of

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:32,120
zombie network of Windows users so any

00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:35,240
thoughts on that I mean yes yes this

00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:39,410
some turn server does the same thing it

00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:43,370
relays the packets for people who do not

00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:45,560
have real internet connectivity

00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:47,750
themselves you don't have a static IP

00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,120
address there behind and that they

00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:53,150
cannot directly communicate with someone

00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:55,760
behind another net so they need to relay

00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:59,510
their media somehow Skype solved that

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:03,140
problem by as if you describe acting

00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:05,270
like a Trojan if it discovered that some

00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:09,830
machine is open to the Internet it would

00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:11,570
turn that machine into a relay you have

00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,670
various consequences if the user

00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:16,490
switches off their machine or if they're

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:19,430
downloading something quality suffers

00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:22,700
that's why deploying the return server

00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:25,270
package here builds much more solid

00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,270
solutions

00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,920
yeah so I've been using a hard sip phone

00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,960
for the last seven years or something

00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,870
and that works pretty well with an

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,370
external sip provider but I could never

00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,350
get the softphone stuff to work on my

00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:41,360
laptop until I got an n900 which

00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:43,850
actually makes phone calls that work so

00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,350
I found the usual problem that you only

00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,130
got one way comms where you couldn't get

00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,259
through the net

00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,869
you end up using Skype to actually talk

00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:52,160
to somebody and now you saying that

00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:56,059
basically you Retton that is all now

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,089
fixed and really will just work and and

00:40:56,059 --> 00:41:01,099
also the second part is if I'm running

00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:02,960
you're a jeopardy server stuff does that

00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:05,029
mean I don't know need an external sip

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,029
provider except for the connecting to

00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:11,750
the PSTN part is that yeah that's that's

00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:13,730
correct just to focus on that first and

00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:18,049
because that relates to the previous

00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:20,930
question about sip providers as well is

00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:24,140
that in the world of email we don't rely

00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:27,950
on external email providers we don't

00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:30,170
have a system of widespread use of email

00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:33,049
to fax gateways I mean they do exist but

00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:36,920
they're not representing more than one

00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:39,200
percent of today's emails so in voice

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,140
over IP we still have a lot of reliance

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,420
on onset providers and their business

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,500
models vary their quality varies

00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:50,960
most of them aim at a low cost market

00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,809
and that has consequences for customer

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,130
support and cause there's a lot of

00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:58,130
frustration for users who are very

00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:00,410
technical he wanted to discuss a problem

00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:03,140
with an engineer because the SIP

00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:06,049
provider has a call center in the

00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,819
Philippines or something like that so

00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:10,279
there's a lot of frustrations there the

00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:12,500
way around it is to build federated

00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:14,690
systems to just work around them I mean

00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:18,670
you still need to have some connectivity

00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:21,920
to the PSTN just a comment from OSI

00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:24,440
apparently Skype no longer proxies

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,230
through users computers and this is a

00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,289
recent change apparently there's Skype

00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:32,690
yeah there is a similar thing in in

00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:34,730
jabber as well called jingle nodes that

00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:38,059
attempts to do the same thing in an open

00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:40,400
way now I won't go into that now so I

00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:43,009
have a couple questions first of all do

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,009
you have any opinions about free switch

00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:47,170
there's the now-obsolete ITP which has

00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:50,299
been closed

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,779
it hasn't been worked on any thoughts

00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:56,769
about that

00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:56,769
and maybe I open that up to someone else

00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,690
[Music]

00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,810
okay I've been failing to a package free

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,450
switch for a very long time

00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:12,200
I'm currently collaborating with someone

00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:16,610
that's one of the free switch developers

00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:19,640
who has done most of the work that I did

00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:21,380
and a load of other work in parallel and

00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,630
a much better job because he understands

00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:28,280
the build system for free switch which

00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:30,680
is a bit twisted to say the least it

00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,420
includes things like W getting libraries

00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:37,460
in the middle of the build which is

00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,930
deeply beautiful so I think there's a

00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:41,270
reasonable chance of it getting packaged

00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:43,250
once we've done an audit of the

00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:46,550
copyright of the hundred and fifty or

00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,900
libraries that they include they seem to

00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,340
have a tendency to whenever they see

00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,860
anything that could conceivably link

00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,410
against free switch some cheerful person

00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:57,440
goes off and does it they're starting to

00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:58,580
understand that that means that you end

00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,870
up with a lot of libraries that are

00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,220
three years out of date because I have

00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:04,850
another manpower to keep on updating

00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:07,580
things maybe we will be able to get that

00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:11,420
as a debian package probably not with

00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:13,340
all those libraries intact there is an

00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,700
instance of free sweets running on void

00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:19,100
Debian net at the moment which we're

00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:24,050
also trying to get to the point where we

00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:26,150
can give all Dedes an account normally I

00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:30,350
set that up as the way that you can make

00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:32,840
calls out of Deb can come this year I

00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:36,740
ended up not having an operational hard

00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:38,960
phone so that didn't happen but

00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,990
hopefully this time round we'll actually

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,870
we've got bits of going into LDAP at the

00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:48,620
moment so that you can select a password

00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:51,650
for your login should be ready really

00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:54,650
soon the server is running the new

00:44:51,650 --> 00:45:00,730
packages now the new packages have some

00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,730
sort of sanity to them hopefully

00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:07,190
well I'm gonna say something that people

00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,800
that like asterisk are gonna get upset

00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:14,619
about now but I'd say that free switches

00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:17,420
to asterisk what postfix is to send mail

00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:19,730
just just to is we we have to wrap up

00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,790
now but I have actually addressed this

00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:25,340
in detail on on the open Telecom store

00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:29,660
dog website and so you can you can read

00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:31,490
this and find all the answers here so so

00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:37,780
thanks thanks for all the questions

00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:37,780
