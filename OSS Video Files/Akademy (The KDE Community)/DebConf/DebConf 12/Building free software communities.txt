Alondra is they were one of the local

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,230
team members of the organization and I

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,099
looked a long time

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:30,560
free software advocate here in Nicaragua

00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:30,560

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:45,149

okay so welcome if you're here your

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:52,079
interesting community work so this is in

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,110
coney going to be a lecture I hope it's

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,430
going to be the start of a discussion

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:12,409
about how to improve communities inside

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:15,409
abbien so so presentation is not working

00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:15,409
nice

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:32,220
so maybe I start telling you who I am

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:34,950
my name is Leandro and one of the DEF

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:40,050
CON organizer and current team leader of

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:43,080
the debian nicaragua community i'm a

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:48,900
contributor to the debian project and

00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:52,050
have been users since 2000 i have been

00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,990
involved in in community work in free

00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,570
software communities both at a local

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:01,160
level in nicaragua and internationally

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:05,940
and i'm going to talk a bit about my

00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:10,440
experience in community work and about

00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:13,050
debian community especially and what we

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:18,870
lack inside the diamond community and

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:21,690
how we can improve it so maybe we should

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,470
start defining what is a local group

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:28,680
what is a local community for instance a

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,360
local community or local group can be

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,910
city based for example Debian Hamburg

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,820
for Debian users in Hamburg or

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:42,780
country-based like Devon occur agua that

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:47,420
is based that is representing a whole

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:50,700
country a local group usually represents

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,920
Debian in this case in advance

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,660
in free software events or technological

00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,410
events have a booth maybe or organize

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:05,810
their own events like Debian day or

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:09,750
install fast or kisaeng name parties

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:12,510
next please so deafening rawa is a

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,920
community that is very very young we

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,950
were established around the year 2007

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,489
we'll have a web page that it's Debian

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:29,810
dot org dot knee and an IRC channel

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:32,430
Deveney at Debian IRC dot Debian dot org

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,000
we represent Debian and organize events

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,190
since a year

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,480
2008 approximately the Debian community

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,010
Nicaragua is very special we work

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,340
together very closely with other

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:53,200
communities for example if there is a

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:55,990
fedora launch party or an ubuntu event

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,330
or whatever the Debian committee which

00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,890
works together with other communities we

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,140
have very very good relationships

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:06,370
between the different communities I know

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:11,340
that this isn't the case always in many

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:14,320
countries but in Nicaragua we we do so

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,250
it's composed mostly our community of

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:22,720
Debian users and contributors we don't

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:26,190
have yet any Debian maintainer or Debian

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,780
developer yet hopefully we will have

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,940
after this Debian conference people

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:38,410
interested in get involved more involved

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:41,620
in Debian so we do a lot of events we

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:45,430
had an event recently that was the

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,669
Debian tool that was several talks and

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:53,860
conferences the universities in

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:59,190
different cities we also have packaging

00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:02,380
sessions this one was from 2008 I think

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,290
we'll remember yurga Debian developer

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:10,680
from El Salvador que mega was packaging

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:13,870
session we also have well installed fast

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,680
we have conferences mostly at

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,220
universities but also we have social

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,580
events

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,590
I think it's underestimated the

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,590
significance and importance of social

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:30,190
events and this is something we we try

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:33,100
to do as often as often as we can not

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:36,190
only being in front of the computer but

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:39,850
also trying to relate to each other and

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,970
and one of the the key success I think

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,940
of our community is that we are not only

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,440
colleagues we're also friends very good

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:52,570
friends and

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:57,370
I think that's very important so when we

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:59,830
talk about local groups maybe we should

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:03,010
look what other other communities are

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:05,730
doing the Fedora community has a program

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:10,090
that is called as a Dora ambassadors

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:12,040
that is one representative or several

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,190
representatives per country that

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,030
represents fedora they have something

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,280
called farms code that is the fedora

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,440
ambassadors steering committee or

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,200
something like that the pizza governing

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,070
body that is in charge of giving

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:33,550
resources and helping ambassadors in in

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,860
the different different countries then

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,920
we have also the example of the Ubuntu

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,770
community the mundo community have what

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:45,040
they called the local teams the local

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,460
teams or the local celebration of local

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:54,240
community and they have around our know

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:58,870
200 220 local groups all over the world

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:03,970
in Europe North America Asia Africa

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:06,760
Australia shaniyah and they are governed

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,340
by a body that is called the Ubuntu low

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:13,540
local council Ubuntu local Community

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:17,710
Council that is composed of of six

00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:20,110
members six board members I was a member

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,830
of the Ubuntu local council for two

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:29,500
years two years I think yeah and what we

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:32,920
did was helping new teams to get

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,810
approved status not they have two

00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,700
different distinction between twins new

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,640
teams and approved teams a new team is a

00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:43,660
team that is forming that is beginning

00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:48,130
to form and an approved team is a team

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:51,130
that has been active for six months 12

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:53,470
months and have done events and and have

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:57,640
set up all the resources like mailing

00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:01,150
lists websites and everything that's

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:05,680
another model it's a bit poor

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:10,780
maybe but it works well in the sense

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,570
that that they they have a group of

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,580
people advising the in the new the new

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:18,700
communities and helping to grow the new

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:26,590
communities in that sense is it's quite

00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:29,140
good so in the case of Debian we have

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,710
Debian local groups there is a wiki page

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:35,820
a wiki dot Adrian dot org slash local

00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:40,180
groups where there is a list of

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:48,300
approximately 35 to 35 local groups from

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:52,770
23 countries and yes coming back to that

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:56,860
in a moment why should we care about

00:08:52,770 --> 00:09:00,400
local groups well Debian has a strong

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:04,690
user base a very strong user base not

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,390
only because of Debian itself also

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:11,440
because of the derivatives that are very

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:14,110
popular and the local groups are a new

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,240
way to reach out to new users it's a

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,980
very good good way to reach out to new

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:24,160
users and maybe someone could say we

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,940
don't care about users why will we reach

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,720
out to new user

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:36,010
well because new users can become

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:39,100
contributors to the project so this page

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,650
this for local groups in the weekend

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:47,290
that we talked about in the in the the

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:50,110
last slide is outdated there is 35 local

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:53,140
groups listed there and maybe half of

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,500
them is not active if you go to the

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:59,170
mailing list of those group there are

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:03,490
archives from 2004 and then there is

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:06,700
nothing so that's something that

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,830
definitely needs to be fixed the other

00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,640
thing is that the wiki page of the local

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,499
groups don't have any useful content if

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,869
you go to that wiki and one

00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:19,089
to start a new group there is no contact

00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:21,459
of there is nothing to say how to start

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:24,009
a local group but that should be

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:27,039
something that has to be listed on the

00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:29,349
loop if I come from Nicaragua Costa Rica

00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,799
or Panama and I want to start a debian

00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:34,449
group in my country I need to know what

00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,759
should I do how should I start and

00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:39,039
that's definitely something that must be

00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:43,079
on that wicking another thing is that

00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:45,069
there is no list of available resources

00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:48,369
when I talk about the available

00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:50,529
resources is may be when you start on

00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:53,109
your group you need to set up some

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:56,979
basics resources for communication for

00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:59,139
example like a mailing list like an IRC

00:10:56,979 --> 00:11:01,959
channel and that's something that the

00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:05,199
Debian project can help with to have an

00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:08,169
IRC channel on Debian on our ctvn.org

00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:10,329
or a mailing list in Debian name space

00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:13,689
that could be something that the project

00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:17,039
could help with and there is there is no

00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:22,269
information on how to proceed with that

00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:25,119
the thing is that because of that many

00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:28,720
groups choose to do the things the wrong

00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:33,819
way some groups have for example their

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,979
page at Debian dot org dot country for

00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:38,709
example their debian dot org dot nee

00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:41,199
Nicaragua Debian doctor doc dot de

00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:45,249
Venezuela and so on and some countries

00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:50,529
have another domain that is completely

00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:55,029
unrelated and that's that's not uniform

00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:58,269
say that another thing is sharing

00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:03,459
experiences there is no way of sharing

00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:05,470
experiences we in in our community we do

00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:09,309
that a lot of interesting same things

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,079
and I'm sure that other communities do

00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,549
the same thing but there is no place

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:17,379
where we can share those experiences

00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:20,679
with other communities and then there

00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:23,649
aren't a point of contact between the

00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:25,190
local user groups and the Debian

00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:26,790
developers or the

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,930
[Music]

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:33,870
the sub-projects of the debian of the

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,330
debian project for example local groups

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:39,780
one of the tasks tasks they can do is

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,850
for example translating and there is no

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,040
no connection or no contact between

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,320
those these local groups that order may

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:53,760
be interested in translating and the

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:58,560
Debian translating teams so what can we

00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,540
do to to fix this one of the thing is to

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,580
encourage the creation of debian of

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:06,050
local Deming community I think it's a

00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,990
great idea to have to have someone

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,760
representing Debian at a local level

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,940
could be a city level or country level

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,570
if the country is small or even at a new

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:21,330
University the other thing is to

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:25,080
maintain a directory an updated

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:29,070
directory of local Debian user groups so

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,740
if someone wants to know where can I

00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,200
find out debian group in Honduras for

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:38,690
example you can look at that directory

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:42,420
and there is an email a contact person

00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:46,590
maybe a another seed channel or

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:49,320
something the other thing is create as I

00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,900
said before create useful content create

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,550
content that is relevant to this to this

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,880
group not only the groups that are

00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:01,470
creating or forming also for the groups

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,290
that are already working and then also

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,720
establish backs best practices when I

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:10,050
talk about best practice I mean how to

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:15,390
solve conflicts is an important thing

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:19,170
and managing resources how do we found

00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:26,940
advanced something like that and yes and

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:29,670
maybe at how to organizing events the

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:36,840
other thing I think we we don't do very

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:38,790
well is publicizing what we do tell

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,019
others what we do tell others what the

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,660
local groups do

00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:45,269
there is maybe a mini debconf or a

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,999
debian event or a debian booth somewhere

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:52,860
and we don't know we don't find out

00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:55,679
because it's not it's not it's not

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,839
properly communicated to the two others

00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,170
so one of the things we can do is

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,999
increase the visibility of the local

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:08,790
events and initiatives maybe through the

00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:13,559
through the Debian planet maybe has have

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:16,319
a Debian user group account where one

00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,439
can post well what the different Debian

00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:21,509
groups around the world are doing and

00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:24,509
maybe also also coordinate with with a

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:28,679
publicity team and make some stories in

00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:31,339
the Debian project news and another

00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,739
thing what the last thing is establish

00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:37,860
not so bureaucratic and excluding

00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:40,529
governance model because while someone

00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:44,069
must maybe coordinate this this effort

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:47,999
part but not doing it is too rigid or so

00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:51,089
bureaucratic and that's all for me I

00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:53,569
don't know if you have some questions or

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:53,569
comments

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:15,790
what I just had one question how do you

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:19,209
deal with the people to continue working

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:24,240
in the in the communities here in the

00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:26,130
Karabakh because I sometimes we have a

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,570
few years back

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:31,329
some people were active in the

00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:41,440
communities but later on there was no

00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:43,329
people to take those work then yes it

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,480
has been a problem here with some

00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:48,610
communities some communities there are

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,880
very very active person to start the

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:55,089
community and do all the work and then

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,300
what that person has other things to do

00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:02,230
maybe work real life then the community

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:05,500
dies what we are doing here in Kerala or

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,410
trying to mentor people for example here

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,900
at Attica at the Central American

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,990
University they have a local user group

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:18,069
and what they do is that they they

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:20,130
mentor other students so they can take

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:24,130
over when the when the student graduates

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:26,380
so and it works very well what we try to

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,329
do is that the new people coming to the

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,150
to the community give them

00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:35,260
responsibilities so they can they can

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:38,980
learn by doing and it has working so far

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:41,890
I think obviously there are there are

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,840
experienced people veterans old people

00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,940
like me that started many years ago

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,720
community that that still are working

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:52,720
but you see many new faces for example

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,260
this year we had Phyllis old Jarrett oka

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,650
and we had I don't know fifty volunteers

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:02,559
and when you look at at the group photo

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,059
photo after after the event half of the

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,040
people I didn't don't know the name

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:07,450
because they're new people and so I

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:13,409
think it's it's really working

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,409
yeah I think what

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,710
there is a big difference going back to

00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:24,149
the early slides of your talk there is a

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:28,299
big difference I believe between what

00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:31,659
well precisely given what makes Debian

00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:36,429
unique a you compared and I think it's

00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:39,570
an interesting exercise how is the local

00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:42,850
Debian community working to our other

00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:46,990
distributions communities so yeah that

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:51,340
shows clearly that well the mentioned

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:54,370
once a 1/2 and Fedora a the

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:58,120
International groups do have a following

00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:02,950
for for creating user groups while in

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:06,429
Debian well I am were very very few user

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:10,269
groups around the world a what what I

00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:13,510
think that they serves more usually and

00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:17,250
maybe better I don't know is the fact

00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:19,809
that instead of being something that

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,679
it's not not delegated but it's self

00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:26,159
being therefore the central authority

00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:30,070
approving you to be the local leader I

00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:32,470
think the process is backwards if there

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,899
is a local community and usually they if

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:38,740
the local community registers Debian to

00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:41,260
talk about me nobody will care I mean in

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,529
some a in some places we have seen that

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:48,820
a Debian demands domain name to be given

00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:53,320
back because it was used for a unclear

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,519
purposes but I don't think we can expect

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,179
a Debian

00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:00,820
to go down and create local communities

00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:03,039
it it's a the other way around the way

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,870
you've been working here and well you

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,970
know that's the reason I was first

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:10,330
attracted to Central America because you

00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,850
you have managed to keep the to make out

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,220
of the very different and disconnected

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,740
local communities not only of the five

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:22,090
countries but of the many different

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:24,820
local places to build a larger community

00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,970
and that shows that there is the power

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,429
to to build large

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:33,419
your projects so I think that that's the

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:36,960
direction in which this should be pushed

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:38,820
and growing yeah I think I also don't

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,100
believe that you can create communities

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,190
from up and down they must grow

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,919
organically I think that really but I

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:52,409
think Debian could also the devil could

00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:55,110
also encourage or or help or make life

00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:57,659
easier maybe for the for the growing

00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,970
communities for the new communities or

00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:01,919
else that that happens what happens in

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,929
Isabel for example there are people that

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,470
are working hard many many years and

00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:09,780
then they get tired well people that are

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,440
officially blessed and all that also get

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:17,120
tired

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:19,830
yes of course so but well for example it

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,409
what has been discussed by several

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,260
people so far in this conference is that

00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:29,159
Debian now has this role of non

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,220
uploading the developer that that role

00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,049
has been used for people doing

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,390
translation documentation work it could

00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:42,559
be used for people doing a art work it

00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:47,280
could be used for people doing a like

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:49,530
global reaching or wide reaching the a

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,700
community work I mean it's not defined

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:57,630
so I think a you are in a great position

00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:00,240
to start exploring that role because as

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,130
Stefano said we only have five non

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,390
uploading videos and the other thing is

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,970
we still don't know what to do with that

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,010
role it's a role we need it and there at

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:11,309
least we have five people who have a

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:13,309
feel that with their profiles but well

00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:16,710
we need more people to do showed

00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:18,539
different ways to yeah I think that's a

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,400
big problem really because many people

00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,440
think that it's difficult to get into

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,900
Debian it's difficult to contribute

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,570
together and I think it's definite the

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,630
the easiest community to get in what

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:33,150
with this release is just jump in do the

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:36,510
work and and really really it's really

00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:39,080
easy but that's why I think we need user

00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,080
groups also

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:50,130
I don't think it's a question of the

00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:53,550
ease or difficulty of getting involved

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,980
it's maybe it's a perception from some

00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,490
people that that they're not a developer

00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,910
yeah so so there's like there's two

00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:05,940
tracks developers there's not a

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:08,550
developer now you don't have to be a

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,370
software developer or an engineer to

00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:15,120
believe in the principles of free

00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:17,880
software and so that's something that

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,670
that needs to be debated over and over

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,730
again is to work out just who is a

00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:26,340
member of Debian isn't someone who can

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,410
do packaging and do software engineering

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,540
or is it someone who believes in these

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:35,130
principles where where is the right

00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:37,800
balance I mean for me the principles are

00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,790
actually more important and so so I

00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,280
think that we should actually be

00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,650
focusing on that area as a community I

00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,500
think the communities are great in that

00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,900
sense because it attracts not only the

00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,230
developers or programmers it attracts a

00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:55,380
broad public or so we have I don't know

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:58,290
lawyers in our community business

00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:04,770
administrators and really developers or

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:06,570
programmers are very few I think that's

00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,760
exactly what the non uploading DD status

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,900
has said we've the project has agreed

00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,540
that we want more people who are

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,400
developers contributing to Debian and if

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,410
you go back to that slide of things that

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,670
need to be done all of those are great

00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,230
projects for someone who wants to get

00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:22,560
involved in Debian we could really use a

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:24,260
guide on how to start a community I I'm

00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,000
the only Debian developer in my city

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,800
there may be two or three other people I

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,600
know who I have persuaded to help

00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,720
contribute things to Debian I wish we

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:37,260
had a bigger community but I don't have

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:40,980
the time to make it happen I would love

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:43,500
other people to try and help push that

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,190
and there were more resources for that

00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,190
it would be useful

00:24:50,100 --> 00:25:00,820
so any more questions well I don't think

00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:02,859
this stop can reach a conclusion maybe

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,450
the main conclusion is you have to do

00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:07,509
more work we have to do more work

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,720
everybody has to do more work I think

00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:14,440
again if you're if you're working around

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:19,149
this topic it means well you may be not

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,950
uploading Duty number six that I think

00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:25,809
everybody recognizes you have done a lot

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:28,629
of work so far and well all of you just

00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:30,100
I mean I know many many from you are not

00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:33,220
from this country just the fact of

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:36,129
travelling to Nicaragua and devoting

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:39,840
some days to be here it shows there is

00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:44,859
interest and there things you can surely

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:47,559
point out that needs to be done well

00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:50,049
it's an interesting exercise to do talk

00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,879
in English having just two guys who

00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:54,489
don't understand Spanish speaking here

00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:57,970
in the front I think it's interesting

00:25:54,489 --> 00:26:01,269
and also that this talk can be useful

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,830
for other people later on so you want to

00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:07,450
discuss this further we are going to

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,869
have above on Friday here at Roberto

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:11,889
