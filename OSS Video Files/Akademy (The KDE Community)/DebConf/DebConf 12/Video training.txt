weird I saw

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,920
so we have the setup in one room we have

00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:45,670
the same setup in both rooms we have

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,400
three laptops in each rooms and they are

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,160
connected to the one camera in the front

00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,010
the camera in the back and this slight

00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,750
grabber here and then there's at this

00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,260
laptop where Phil is sitting at the big

00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,870
camera

00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,970
there's the device which program running

00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:07,090
which you can use to switch between the

00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:11,490
different streams this is one set up

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:15,820
maintaining the cameras and in the room

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,220
we restream in the day in the night

00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:24,190
there are drops running which encode the

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:26,410
videos to smaller resolutions this needs

00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,350
reviewing there's a Penta interface for

00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:35,860
this so you can mark fires for reviewing

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:37,690
and these are the three work areas we

00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,530
have we have those two rooms to cover

00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:43,690
and the reviewing and today the sets

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,060
this year will explain I think first the

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:50,890
camera and then the reviewing process or

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:54,490
maybe I think that's the best reviewing

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,310
needs to be done every day during the

00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:05,500
talks also so that we don't have a

00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:07,330
backlog in the end know what else to say

00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:13,690
in general I think we should just start

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:16,420
with the training and which is done

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,360
Franklin will introduce the camera

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,930
workflow in the room and Thiago will

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,320
explain the reviewing process both are

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,930
documented in the wiki there's links to

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,840
the reviewing process here and there's

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,230
the these cheat sheets for the devices

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,750
but it's actually better to look what

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,060
people are doing and learn by really

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,380
watching and reading the cheat sheets as

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,380
an additional help

00:02:46,470 --> 00:03:03,360
okay well first maybe the camera if you

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:09,970
don't understand me just let me know I

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:13,210
try to speak slower and better we have

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:18,190
two cameras basically this one is mainly

00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:20,140
intended to get the audience until one

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,530
other one obviously is mainly intended

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:27,310
to get the speaker on some occasion you

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,790
may want to do different shots sometimes

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,110
we have at some point who had someone

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,300
standing here which was doing

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,340
translation and it could be nice to show

00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:42,190
that guy and only that camera could do

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:44,920
it sorry for moving with that something

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:50,770
we try to avoid we avoid to move the

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:52,510
camera when when we join to talk because

00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,390
when we move the camera right even to

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:59,470
talk it's crappy so it's nice to avoid

00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,000
moving during the talk we can move the

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,400
camera during the talk but then the

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,840
other camera should be on because we can

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:12,700
switch the sources so yeah thank you for

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,010
making this clear okay so with this

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:19,810
camera so usual I don't know if you have

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:22,930
done some video four years ago I didn't

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,360
do any so I just try to give you all the

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:30,280
tricks I've learned and we have been

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:35,770
told if the speaker moves a lot you

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,150
probably want to have some large shot so

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,700
you don't have to move the camera all

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:44,160
the time again whereas if the speaker is

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:49,150
standing still you can have the whole

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,160
shot just right on him it's good idea

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,610
also to move sometime and have different

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,129
view so the speaker is not always you

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,989
don't always see see

00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:07,080
in the same position you can have

00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:11,699
smaller smaller short larger short this

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:19,919
one is actually requires actually more

00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:23,909
work I'll try to stream maybe no with

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,069
this one you want to have feedback from

00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:28,699
the audience so it's nice at the

00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:33,439
beginning of the talk to have a large

00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:36,029
shot to see the everybody in the room

00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,189
especially the seat where there are

00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:39,749
people you see in this case I would

00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:43,279
probably more focus on the right side

00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:45,659
and so on the left side things like that

00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,550
so those are nice to have you know a

00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:54,809
feeling of how many people are in the

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:57,089
room and stuff like that during the talk

00:05:54,809 --> 00:06:02,039
you can spot at some people in the

00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:03,689
audience so the talk is more personal

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,639
and we know you know we're community we

00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:08,759
want to see that there's people in the

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,819
room obviously we don't want to see

00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:15,589
people who are sleeping or we are

00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:19,129
hugging on the laptop but that's appears

00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:19,129
we have a hint

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,080
people should always use my key to ask

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:31,300
question because of this camera moving

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,229
problem there might be a problem if you

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,199
make shoots of follow-through persons

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:41,259
and then the speaker asks how many then

00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:48,189
normally you should zoom house as as

00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:51,009
fast as possible and you have two

00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:56,169
possibilities I do not make these close

00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:58,840
shots or or you move and you zoom out

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:08,110
and don't care about it that you

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:11,080
shouldn't move the camera actually this

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:13,029
is a good question in just probably many

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:17,050
Unsworth depending on who you ask

00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:19,629
I would go for if your has a wrong shot

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,930
if you are no ho and you want to watch

00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:28,060
out just right now personally I would

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:30,550
just be be bold and move right away some

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,400
of the people we try to be nicer and you

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,560
go switch to the slide and then let the

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,659
cameraman open the view to have a low

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:43,740
larger shot and they go back to the

00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:43,740
audience or it depend how you feel

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,980
one thing that if you're the director is

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,780
really annoying is when someone zooms

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,570
into the person that's just about to ask

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,730
question and you think oh great and then

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,710
the cameraman decides that it's not the

00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,690
perfect shot and tries to adjust it

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,060
because that's the perfect moment to

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,560
have gone to that camera and then the

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,050
person's head goes whizzing around the

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,540
screen so if the shots good enough just

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,240
leave it alone it's much better to have

00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,190
an okay shot than to have the wandering

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,680
camera thing and it's really difficult

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:42,330
to move that camera without making it go

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,430
all over the place the other thing that

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,400
I like for that camera is if the the

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,530
speaker is walking back and forth it's

00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,870
difficult to track with this camera so a

00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:55,560
side shot in this room it doesn't work

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,730
so well in the other room it'll probably

00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,430
be good because they'll be talking

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,830
towards their slides and you can have

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,480
them walking back and forth on the side

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,080
camera and they'll be walking towards

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,880
that camera whereas on this the the

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,100
cameraman has to keep on wandering the

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,720
camera back and forth so that's another

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,750
reason to if there's nothing interesting

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,930
in the audience point of the speaker

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,930
maybe

00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,769
so we've already you have pointed out a

00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:47,970
few times that we want to avoid moving

00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:52,290
the camera when when the pitch was from

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:55,680
that camera is in use we have a trick

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:59,240
for that and usually we used to have

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,069
something nicer and more efficient but

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,160
for this session for this we will have

00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:08,249
to do manually the guy behind the TV

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,709
switch it's actually the guy who select

00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:14,459
which picture we send to the stream and

00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:18,839
when he used pictures from here then

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:22,589
he's supposed to raise his red pepper to

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:27,449
say well don't move I'm publishing your

00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:30,449
stream and once Superboy is down you can

00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:35,420
move the camera as you want again that

00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:35,420
seems clear to you any questions so far

00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:47,939
we have yet another stream a third

00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:50,370
stream which it's the one from the

00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:57,749
presenter laptop at this moment I am the

00:10:50,370 --> 00:11:01,740
presenter so I could for instance show

00:10:57,749 --> 00:11:04,529
my screen sees pictures a comes from I

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:11,779
mean from my laptop to this box we call

00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:18,149
it to impact the resolution of the

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:24,449
laptop should be 800 by 600 or 1024 by

00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:28,559
768 the 800 by 600 is nicer because it's

00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:31,800
very large for your information the

00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:41,929
stream we are sending you out is 320 by

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:41,929
240 so it's very slow very small

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:57,860
we'll go to the other world

00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:02,530
okay this is basically how big the

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,530
picture are what we broadcast

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,110
yay

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,900
just for your information we have

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:38,710
usually something like say six to eight

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:44,350
second delay for this trim well that's

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:46,870
fine as you can see the what we push in

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,000
the pitch one picture it's fairly small

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,890
I mean the picture is already small but

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,420
what's in pitch one picture is even

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:56,560
smaller so when you use whole of delete

00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,260
switch

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:03,970
keep that in mind and don't expect

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,800
people to be able to read the stuff if

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,790
it's a slide that is in the picture and

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:15,790
picture the small square thing obviously

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:19,150
it's almost impossible to read it what

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:21,070
would we say about TV switch though the

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,050
for the recordings the quality will be

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,090
better because the price dream has

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,070
really low quality so everybody in the

00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,660
world can see the streams but the

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,520
recordings will have quote resolutions

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:37,620
and slides up at a readable yeah yeah

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,620
still what you said

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:47,620
pin through camera one camera two

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:52,850
we usually have three microphone in each

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:56,660
home one for with headset and

00:13:52,850 --> 00:14:00,320
one and that things the third one in

00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:03,110
each room has a code it's not connected

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,130
right now but it should be there should

00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,380
be a microphone yeah going to the wall

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,000
this is a job for the audio stream maybe

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:21,080
you want to say something about the

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:26,150
audio right news the the audience is

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:28,340
pretty easy it's just to micro type two

00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,650
microphones I think this one which is

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:35,900
for the audience which is for the

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:37,460
speaker and yeah I mean you should have

00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,090
a look on the the equipment itself it's

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:45,350
just turning it on level the the volume

00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:46,820
and that's pretty much it I make sure

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,680
that they're always batteries on these

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:53,600
microphones because they're wireless so

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:59,000
there are some charges and you should

00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:01,430
always charge them when do we switch the

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,970
batteries do we switch it at noon and

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:09,220
evening or I would switch them at the

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:11,660
berries before every new speaker because

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,840
so you will be sure that there's no

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:20,510
problem since they are rechargeable it's

00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:25,160
not a problem okay I think now we should

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:28,280
be we should go we should split in few

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:32,860
teams and each one looking at each one

00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:41,900
of those device we have some cheat sheet

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:46,040
somewhere somewhere like this there is

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:48,740
one cheat sheet for this camera it is

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,660
how to zoom in to zoom out and a few

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,840
stuff which you should know it's good if

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:56,750
you can't tell time to read it if you

00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,810
speak Spanish on the wiki you can find

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:05,529
some translated version of this pepper

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:07,480
on some of those pepper we have to check

00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:16,060
for the camera over there because we

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:21,790
have some kind of tape disc to to switch

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:27,180
and to empty such a cheat sheet for the

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:29,889
TV switch it's a guy who decide which

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:36,399
stream we broadcast this is a whole name

00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:40,329
diameter and cheat sheet for the audio

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:45,550
stuff so we can split the group fan in

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:48,309
one two three four groups maybe one

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:51,730
thing this is we have this volunteer

00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:55,350

00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:08,589
positions are taking here please go

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:11,829

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:14,110
where you want to work at best today so

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,600
that we can see where which talks need

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:19,329
more volunteers not just only show up

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,579
but also please sign up intenta if you

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,470
don't I haven't done if you don't have

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:27,669
the rights to that come to me and I will

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:30,030
give you access to Penta so that you can

00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,030
do that

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:43,010
the talk Meister role is not related to

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,890
the video team and the coordinator is an

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:47,600
experienced person was sitting in the

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,730
room and making sure that people are

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:58,940
doing the jobs and show up and as find

00:17:49,730 --> 00:18:04,820
replacements okay when dorito one son

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:10,130
mixer the coding at all is something

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:11,780
which is done per half day so you should

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,610
be quite experienced to do it because

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:18,830
you're the guy in charge of helping

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:20,420
others solving problems they have and if

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:28,160
you take all you need to take half day

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:33,290
all the morning or the afternoon during

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,660
the talk we can have a look at the IRC

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:39,260
channels there are two tires to IRC

00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:44,000
channels usually the guy at the TV

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:46,700
switch use it and in the other room we

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,100
use the IRC channel to communicate

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,800
between the audio the people use audio

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:56,480
room and people switch to know if the

00:18:51,800 --> 00:19:04,010
sound level is okay on the strip any

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:07,820
question yeah this is something I forgot

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:10,310
about the sound we had before a backup

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,970
microphone with which went into this box

00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:15,950
this apparently doesn't work so we can

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,790
plug in another wireless microphone like

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:22,190
this one we have enough or these and the

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,770
other thing is yeah about the we oppose

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,940
a headset which is very convenient the

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:31,730
main speakers should have their headset

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:36,910
just make sure that ya can demonstrate

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:39,500
this just make sure that the microphone

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:42,470
this is microphone then it's not like

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:46,960
this so you won't understand anything so

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,960
you have to take care that they

00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:56,510
at the same height with the mouth sorry

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:28,140
yeah sure sure yeah Phil can you show

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:43,290
people how to use TV switch I guess

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:48,540
you'll do the audio part just go through

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:51,930
all four jobs and try and actually touch

00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:55,770
the camera and actually try the camera

00:20:51,930 --> 00:21:03,230
see how it's connected where you turn it

00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:07,080
on/off yes on this camera you should

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:09,360
start recording by pressing the button

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:13,710
at the beginning of the talk and stop at

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,570
here but people do on this one we don't

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:22,040
have any tape so it's not need to do it

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:22,040
and it is that's it

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,330
