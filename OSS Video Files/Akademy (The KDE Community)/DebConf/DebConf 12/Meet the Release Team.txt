so hi I'm Phil this is Adam he tends to

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:13,230
be a bit shy so you noticed that Malkin

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,289
already did the other talk I'm doing

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,189
this talk but you will help with the

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,949
questions of course so I want to show

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:27,830
what we are actually doing if anybody

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:31,679
has an interest in actually helping us

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,290
you can find some pointers you can like

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:39,000
get to know what would help us to get

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,940
our job done so that's rough outline

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,059
about I will talk shortly about how the

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,840
team is structured then about how we

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,920
communicate internally not really how

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,640
people communicate with us what we are

00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,329
doing what kind of documentation exists

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,190
if it if if it exists and what kind of

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,559
tools we use and then I hope we have

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,630
enough time so that people can actually

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,170
ask questions about how things work

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,210
because if you know how the tools we use

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,520
work it makes it easier to communicate

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,700
with us makes it easier to get started

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,560
if you want to do a bit more than you're

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,049
currently doing with you involvement or

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:27,060
to release him so about the rules

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:31,409
commonly we say and our homepage says

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,240
we're divided in both managers who have

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,060
the final say who have to feel

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:41,390
responsible we have the assistants who

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:44,670
do the actual work and we have results

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,549
whom we can direct to tricky questions

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:54,659
about where we don't know ourselves what

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:57,719
to do so some of that is true especially

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,640
tricky questions part so we are grateful

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,670
that we still have the old release

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,290
managers around to help us when we need

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,229
it

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:09,000
in reality though it's mostly consensus

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,440
driven whoever does it gets to make the

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,560
decision so normally

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,980
we have some kind of common sense and

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,840
people pick what they want to do and

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,550
when they are sufficiently capable to do

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,980
it they just do it alone and they don't

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:30,860
have to ask every time should I do that

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:33,920
can I do this so the last point actually

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,840
says there's one exception if you do

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,150
destructive actions you might want to

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,960
ask first so there are some things that

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,270
are not easily recovered from in this

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,390
case you better ask before you're doing

00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:51,430
that if you're unsure that it actually

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:56,840
works but that works pretty well first

00:02:51,430 --> 00:03:00,260
so we feel as one team it's not that we

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,950
are always like looking up at our

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:07,580
managers and asking them what to do but

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,530
it's really sort of we try to find a

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,650
common opinion on something and then we

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,420
decide on it unless nobody wants to

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,520
actually decide and then somebody gets

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:23,900
to pick so it's like other things in

00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:26,540
Debian so the communication channels are

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,750
mainly the mailing lists in IRC there's

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:33,230
pretty much communication between us on

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,670
IRC so the mailing this is Debian -

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,190
release at least up in the dark

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,190
everybody can subscribe we are handing

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:43,120
this a bit differently from the code of

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:46,150
conduct in that we

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,150
[Music]

00:03:51,900 --> 00:04:06,700
you have to tell me what you want me to

00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:08,140
do okay I see like this no okay so we

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,569
are handing this a bit differently

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:14,019
Oh though I think it's not noted in that

00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:16,509
we are actually writing a mail to the

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:19,150
person and see see the list which is a

00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:21,070
total no no on the other lists but we do

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:25,930
that in the assumption that we are on

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:28,180
that list and the others are not so it's

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,090
all archived if you want to see what we

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,550
are doing you can take a look

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,889
IRC is not archived except in people's

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,220
logs which is a bit sad because there's

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:42,660
so much knowledge in it but it's far as

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:45,940
an efficient medium of communication so

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,370
Debian - release is basically also a

00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,020
public channel there's no such thing as

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,720
a backroom channel where we discuss

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:57,190
things those things have existed in the

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,889
past we do though have an internal

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,560
discussion list team at release that

00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:06,039
I've endured arc which is sometimes used

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,030
for the tricky questions about how to

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:14,020
announce something how to argue with the

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,389
maintainer there are cases where the

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,770
leader contacts us about something and

00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,599
doesn't want to do that in public

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,010
because it isn't sure what we think

00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:27,880
about it so there are some threats going

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:30,070
on there but it isn't much and yeah

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,650
licit that because it's also in the

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,570
topic of the icy Channel sometimes our

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,820
Titan pads at lists like to do items

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,090
what's the left to do for easy that's

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,090
wrong

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,970
right so if somebody does a CAPTCHA on

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:57,960
that video and puts that mailing address

00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:00,540
online that would be unhelpful for the

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,160
team list that was the comment because

00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:08,430
it's not spam filter so if you want to

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,680
get involved the most useful thing is

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,710
probably if you're lurking around on the

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,300
IRC channel there are some people who

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,760
are not on the release team who speak

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,250
there a lot

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,520
helpful comments a lot there are some

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:28,380
unhelpful comments of course but if you

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:31,650
need like a discussion about a thing

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:35,280
that you want to get like into easy it

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,080
might make sense to use IRC if it's much

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,900
back and forth but of course it's not

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,050
archived and you can also log on the

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,030
mailing list and if you want to be

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,490
sucked in you're staying there you're

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:51,090
doing helpful comments and at some point

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:53,010
we might just grab you and not trying

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,800
not to let you escape so that you're

00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:58,770
actually doing work which might of

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,310
course be detrimental to other things

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:05,250
you do in Debian but okay that's really

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:09,450
important releasing work so what we are

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:13,170
doing is coordination a lot like

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:15,390
transition timing and I know that people

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,220
are unhappy with that that they have to

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:21,360
wait HS until they get the transition

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,520
approved but that's also manpower

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,910
dependent and dependent on how well

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,220
those transitions are prepared of the

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,910
others so you could of course make sure

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:36,270
that they are not screwing it up we're

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,340
doing pinon imbuing related to

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,940
transitions we are temporary proxy

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,960
verities so that the count is what we

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:48,600
think it should be we're doing cleanups

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,150
like removals from testing of course

00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,450
also partial removals of some

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,620
architectures in unstable sometimes if

00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,250
it's clear that this is the way to go

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,340
we do some maintenance like on Brittany

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,980
some other tools I will show you later

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,540
and that's one package in the archive

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:13,520
even we have which is seven archive

00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:16,580
keeping and we really do a real lot of

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,760
upload reviews so that's our main job we

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:22,520
do it for proposed updates we do it for

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,190
testing now and sometimes we also do it

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,170
pre upload when we are asked is this

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:35,860
okay

00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:35,860
to upload as for the documentation yeah

00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:44,750
it's not nothing but it's not much we

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,700
really like that to improve but of

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,290
course if you have a limited time and

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,240
you need to get work done writing

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,910
documentation might be a bit on the

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,250
bottom of the list there's some

00:08:52,910 --> 00:09:01,670
documentation linked from our team wiki

00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:06,710
page there's information about how point

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:10,490
releases are done on a special page yeah

00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,730
we hope that in the near future we will

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:17,000
have more documentation on that so

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:19,700
that's our team page which basically

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,840
says how to contact us what we are doing

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:26,000
and you see there are few checklists

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,680
there's a bit about Brittany there's a

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,720
bit about the transition track I will

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,430
talk about in a moment and for stable

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,170
you have everything you ever wanted to

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,030
know about stable release management in

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,830
Debian but we're afraid to ask or how I

00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:43,370
learned to stop worrying and love the Q

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,080
viewer which actually if you care about

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:52,760
the stable release process tells you

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:55,880
what we are doing right so tool wise I

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,610
think everybody knows Brittany which are

00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,950
testing migrations lucky enough we now

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,830
have Brittany - running which is a

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,110
rewrite of the original path and script

00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,860
which is actually more readable than the

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,860
original version

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,720
[Music]

00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:17,989
now of course I messed that up so

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,269
there's a repository for it Britany to

00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:26,439
target and there's a glue code in

00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:26,439
Brittany wanted for historical reasons

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:34,539
yeah so that's just the wrong way round

00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:37,279
if you want to run Brittany you

00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:40,279
basically check out Brittany to that kid

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,759
and you look at Brittany wonder kid on

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:46,189
how it's really invoked that's just

00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,929
because we had we didn't move that yet

00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:51,799
then there's the incredible transition

00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:58,269
tracker called Ben y MIDI dougie and

00:10:51,799 --> 00:11:01,099
Stefan grande roue which is this thing I

00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:05,319
don't know how many people actually look

00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:05,319
at those pages or no those pages so

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:11,089
there are few okay actually if you're

00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:13,249
doing a transition we are creating a

00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:18,769
page for it there's an overview page

00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:22,089
which is lucky enough pretty empty right

00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:25,129
now because we're in freeze time

00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:28,389
actually what we need from you is which

00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:31,069
packages need to be rebuilt and

00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:33,470
previously you submitted like a whole

00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:36,679
list of manual collected packages and

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,989
what this thing does is you actually

00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,239
have an expression that matches on the

00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:43,369
packages files and says okay this

00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:45,889
depends still on the old one and we

00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,989
wanted to depend on the new one and then

00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:50,119
you see which ones actually still need

00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:57,489
to be rebuilt and can schedule banana

00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:57,489
music ardingly this gets also pretty

00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:04,459
there you see almost completed

00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:05,929
transition it still requires people to

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:08,569
actually look at it and schedule a

00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:11,479
banana muse but it's very very helpful

00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:19,209
to see where we are within the

00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:22,760
transition then we have a few tiny tools

00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:25,220
that we are using right now like D

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,720
which displays you adaptive between

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,550
testing in and whatever we want to

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,370
migrate which is mostly the unstable

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:34,010
package or the package in testing

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,740
proposed updates so if you're sending us

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:39,380
an unblocked request it's nice if you

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,440
include adaptive but we will always look

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,270
at that output so even if there's

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,670
already newer version in unstable we

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,410
will always look at the different esting

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,870
what's really interesting now and the

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:54,230
new version there are sometimes some

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:56,900
surprises where people didn't actually

00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,550
realize that that package before wasn't

00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,450
in testing yet and that the diff is

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:04,550
actually pretty huge so what that will

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,680
outputs is something like ok they are

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,110
already Hinson plays somebody already

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,880
took care of it like there's an

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,810
unblocked in for this package a CPI

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,480
support and then it starts off with how

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,640
much changed and then adaptive and then

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,390
we go through it and say ok that's fine

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,980
let it in

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:28,340
it also helpfully generates the right

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:33,080
hint for that there's a hint tool that

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:35,390
was the lifting for the hints like I do

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,240
hint easy sauce package name and they

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:41,110
get the version in the right syntax it

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,480
does the cleanup of the hint files etc

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,850
funny enough there's also WB which

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,640
people know from the wanna build

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,080
requests on the wanna build list that's

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:56,210
actually maintained by the release team

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:58,640
for historical reasons and those tools

00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:02,030
can be found in the release tools yet if

00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:05,840
somebody wants to look at them feel free

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:08,720
to feel free to submit patches if you

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,810
find them useful firstable in old stable

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,130
we have to cure you on again I don't

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,390
know how many people look at that I

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:20,650
think mainly the stable release team

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,650
that's this page

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,369
this page actually displays all the

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:35,470
packages that will be present in the

00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:37,990
next point release and processed so what

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,970
we have at the top is a reason or

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,160
rationale for every package that will be

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,749
included the architectures that are

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,850
already built the architectures that are

00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:48,579
still missing because the security team

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,160
to release the DSA and didn't rate for

00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:55,259
the ia-64 build like MySQL because it

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,939
fails to build so that we actually don't

00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:01,480
introduce regressions architecture wise

00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:04,269
into stable this also means that some

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:08,679
things are currently not going to be

00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:15,309
fixed and stable without I mean on ia-64

00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:17,860
because there's no support for that yeah

00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:20,740
it also does versioning checks like this

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,269
package is actually has a higher version

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,579
number than testing or has a higher

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:27,279
version number than unstable it does

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:29,139
install ability checking if it if the

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,920
dependency still work or if somebody

00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:36,670
built it on testing and push it into

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:40,899
stable or stable security retail doesn't

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:43,059
happen yeah that's a lot of stuff that

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:49,959
could actually be avoided if we had

00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:56,350
source only uploads but ok that's this

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:58,149
page which is it provides step tips for

00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,769
review that didn't I didn't show they

00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:02,620
look pretty similar 2d it's the same

00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:05,679
engine and we are looking at those again

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,329
to see if that's suitable for stable and

00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,779
it also helps to generate the

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:12,670
announcements so basically if you have

00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:15,069
any questions about what we are doing I

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,529
just wanted to do some quick overview

00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:21,519
about where our code lives what we are

00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:24,309
doing and stuff please ask them I don't

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,379
know how many people they are that are

00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:29,290
bit interested in what we're doing or

00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:32,339
interesting doing that work by

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,339
themselves first

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,670
can you share an update about the idea

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:53,480
of transforming Britney interns even to

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:58,490
a Sat solver solution producer what do

00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:03,110
you mean by update okay so there was a

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:07,149
project by your him partner to implement

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:11,809
that and he has it running concurrently

00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:13,970
so he has his own instance running on

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:16,819
another machine and pushes hints to the

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:20,329
real Britney so that if it finds a hint

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:23,000
that real Britney doesn't find for

00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:26,270
transitions that this is actually

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,740
applied however the current Britney to

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:35,029
code has an auto in the feature that

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:38,659
already figures out pretty much most of

00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:40,520
the ins so it's not currently that

00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:42,440
useful as it could have been if we

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,529
didn't have the auto enter if that makes

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,529
sense

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,150
any further questions

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:09,080
oh I would like to ask about

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:11,990
architecture qualifications you did a

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:16,850
dance or did start talking about these I

00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:21,440
think in April or May last year then

00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:25,190
well it did nothing had happened for I

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,820
think 14 or 15 months and I think that

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:32,210
puts a lot of pressure or work on well

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,070
developers not to know what is the

00:18:32,210 --> 00:19:00,230
target for the next release and I think

00:18:34,070 --> 00:19:01,550
that's very very unfortunate yes I agree

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,360
we should have done it much sooner and

00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:08,450
we will do four plus one and I'm very

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,210
sorry that cause any issues but I don't

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:14,680
don't really have a excuse other than we

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,680
let it slip and we shouldn't have done

00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:23,650
he did say that we don't really have a

00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,890
solid excuse except for us letting it

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:29,320
slip because we maybe didn't design

00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,720
enough priority to it but I think mainly

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,600
it's an issue of actually taking the

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,730
decision which takes somebody to take

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:42,310
the decision and given the way we work

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:44,200
it's hard just as a person come coming

00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,210
forward to say like this architecture

00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,460
won't be part and then the project not

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:52,360
accepting that or something so it's also

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:55,390
pretty tricky politic right so yeah I

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:59,020
know but I mean for her it was really

00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:00,970
tricky for us to justify that we will

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:05,170
really not have it as a technology

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:09,460
preview given the effort they have put

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:13,540
it put in yes sir so particularly in the

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:15,340
herd example there was a question of so

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,720
so when do we announce that it's not

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:21,850
going to be good enough for that it is

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,950
good enough and it's essentially the

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:26,470
problem was we kept on thinking oh well

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,050
if we don't say anything then maybe

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:31,570
we'll get better and then it'll just get

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:34,570
better it'll be good enough but it kept

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:36,220
on not doing that so at some point you

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:40,230
have to say right okay this isn't going

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:42,760
to happen and that's obviously a very

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,470
difficult mail to write and it's

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,900
something that you don't want to tell

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:50,320
people so there is some optimism to say

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:53,680
well maybe it will be okay and yes we

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,630
should have done it sooner trying to

00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,520
work out when is is quite difficult and

00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,920
what criteria you can put in place to

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,660
make that happen I mean in principle we

00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,990
need to look at it pretty late in the

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,910
cycle in the terms of is there actually

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,590
something really broken on it I know

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:12,970
it's bad from the toolchain point of

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:15,370
view and to just shortly get back to

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,710
hurt again there was also the thing that

00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,360
the ftp mosses said that hurt will be

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,560
removed from the archive if they don't

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,910
make the release and they did a

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:31,149
tremendous effort to do more months

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:34,190
before we decided not included so

00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:36,019
and then it's also the question what

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,210
hardware we have for that part I know

00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:42,980
that's also an issue and we have issues

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:45,720
with Bill T's yeah I don't know

00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,019
we will suddenly lose architectures for

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:56,179
[Music]

00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:57,289
BC plus one that's pretty sure okay do

00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,090
you have any ideas on which

00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:05,289
architectures are going to be at risk

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:11,450
for Weezy plus one well certainly s/390

00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:17,450
know that in any case pretty sure also

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:21,500
ia 64 that's a recurring theme of spark

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:23,990
that's true but maybe somebody steps up

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't know that's the thing I mean if

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,610
your volunteer base it's possible that

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,159
somebody picks up like an interest again

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:34,460
but you know it's tricky it's also

00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:37,100
tricky that we have so few partners

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,500
actually who step up and say that they

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,889
feel responsible for it and that there

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,620
are few persons that if something grave

00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:54,340
arrives on any part step up and say okay

00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:59,210
I'm going to fix this so when we drop

00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:01,730
hppa and alpha jeong's last cycle there

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,440
was a very bad experience so it was

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,159
announced as we are moving these

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,690
architectures to ports but basically

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,929
these two architectures were screwed up

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:15,409
in the way they were moved to two ports

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:20,600
so maybe it's better to to have the

00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:23,389
ports archive better supported and well

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:27,289
so that that Potter's are less scared

00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:32,509
about being moved to ports I mean we had

00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:36,379
that discussion but I mean the parts

00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:39,080
archive guys are very few and they do a

00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:42,320
great job and as an incubation thing for

00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,970
s v9 t x it was great and alpha isn't

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,190
actually i think from the

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,710
things I saw some months ago not looking

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:53,210
bad compared to the other architectures

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:55,220
on parts so it's really silly that we

00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,519
have to re-implement everything for

00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:01,129
parts it all is it also plays a wanna

00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:03,769
build and build well build the

00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:05,480
infrastructure also I mean there are

00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:07,580
other things connected lightyears I'm

00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,409
not wanting to have something that's not

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:14,240
running on architecture that we really

00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:17,289
support and stuff I think it's hard for

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,149
a project to care about those

00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:25,009
architectures if they are not in the

00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:27,169
main distribution even if they are very

00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:31,039
motivated sh4 people are also very

00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:32,659
motivated and they take Jesus he takes a

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:42,320
week to build on the fastest build a

00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:44,389
indeed they have yeah so yeah doctor

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,289
argue argues that they at least work on

00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:49,429
tool chain issues which is correct yeah

00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:52,629
which might not be said of all

00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:52,629
architectures we have here

00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:07,519
go on tell us the name of AG plus one I

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:11,989
think I think the name is overrated

00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:16,940
right now I don't feel like that but I

00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:26,509
mean it was said when it it will be

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:28,549
announced when it's ready I'll see boggy

00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:32,350
sadly already taken by the ftp masses

00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:32,350
without concerned of to release him yes

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:42,950
so York I kind of stole it for

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:47,109
experimental yeah so don't argue that he

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,109
should have stole Scott

00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:10,080
any further questions discussions what

00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:10,080
we screwed up what we should do better I

00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:17,200
mean we are open to critic I mean it's

00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:20,080
not all Sol observable with the manpower

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,029
we have and the assistance we have to a

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,690
great job Adam does a really fantastic

00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:28,269
job a stable release manager as testing

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:32,830
release manager doing a lot of work our

00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:34,929
assistants do a lot of work so okay

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,700
you're asking us but ask you back what

00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:38,200
do you think went really has gone really

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:50,859
well and what do you think has has not

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:53,679
gone well I mentioned the the time base

00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:56,559
freeze stuff earlier in my talk there's

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,859
some stuff we need to improve there I

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,989
think project as all has to is will

00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:04,629
hopefully start to believe and say when

00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:07,840
we say we're going to be freezing then

00:27:04,629 --> 00:27:10,179
then we actually are freezing then then

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,679
I think if what people start to actually

00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:14,590
think about that a bit more that may

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,419
help there is an issue at the moment

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:22,149
with DI packages and how they're being

00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:26,169
handled because obviously this people

00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:28,269
are busy so sue rule has to have sad to

00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:29,980
step in a bit there and so that that's

00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:32,230
something that certainly if anyone has

00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,989
experience with di and doing di releases

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:38,019
then that would be helpful I think right

00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:41,739
so so with DI especially we had problems

00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:45,129
that there were no releases of any sort

00:27:41,739 --> 00:27:47,739
for HS and it was always a problem like

00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:52,539
that I mean always for as long as I was

00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:55,869
part I'm pretty young but that's

00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:57,489
certainly an issue the other thing is

00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:04,720
that we would like to have to project

00:27:57,489 --> 00:28:06,789
fix bugs which I don't see does it I

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,809
don't say it doesn't work but there are

00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:12,710
too few people working on that but

00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:15,720
that's not a release

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:18,929
release him can really fix I mean unless

00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,690
we say like you fix a park you get an

00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:25,889
unblocked free or something or freeze

00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:29,539
exception free but I don't know if you

00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:29,539
want to go down that road

00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:37,429
incentives bribery

00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,490
any other question

00:28:53,390 --> 00:29:01,130
so let's oh that is an aggressive okay

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:04,250
so looking at di a bit more I know it's

00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,720
long been a problem that do releases and

00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:10,330
the rest the releases haven't worked out

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,770
and for a very long time you Deb's what

00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:15,260
would never migrate automatically all

00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:18,650
that kind of thing well exactly are we

00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:24,070
on that word how far we are

00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:26,090
yeah I think I should probably be

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:29,660
continuously integrated in the main

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:34,670
archive that progress hasn't been made

00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:36,320
yet I'm not actually sure what's

00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:39,620
blocking more frequent uploads to

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,780
unstable that we built a dailies from

00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,450
SVN and don't actually need to upload

00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,850
the changes might not help in this

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:49,070
regard because there are changes in the

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,250
DI package that are lingering around for

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:54,140
months or years until they get uploaded

00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,680
to the archive I don't think we are

00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,320
there

00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,770
I think the youtubes thing in Brittany

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:04,040
is helpful

00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:07,670
yeah but that's really a question for

00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:13,850
the DI team turn so rich isn't here but

00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:16,400
I mean as a team I'm on the room I mean

00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:19,160
we discuss this over lunch one time I

00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,920
think you were present too but there are

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,590
several technical issues to solve it is

00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,590
I think I guess the problem biggest one

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:31,310
is how to build and transition the

00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:35,960
Debian installer package because how

00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:39,290
it's currently done as far as I know the

00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,750
daily builds take the you depth either

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:44,300
from our stable or testing depending on

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:47,050
what phase of the release we're all that

00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,730
used to be the switch you could make

00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:52,730
probably it's nowadays from unstable

00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:55,070
yeah but it builds an installer that

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:58,270
actually through runny installs testing

00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:02,240
not unstable which is saying I think we

00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:05,840
anyway then but if you transition this

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,100
installer and you have to have all the

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,130
you devs that

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:12,980
into also to transition into testing at

00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:15,649
the same time all you upload another

00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,539
installer to testing proposed update and

00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:19,970
built this one with testing you'd apps

00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:23,409
and just keep the Installer from

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:25,789
unstable out of testing at all that's

00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:27,769
are some of the option yeah it's a

00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:29,840
question what we want to do so di is a

00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:32,690
pretty special package if you upload it

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,580
you're unstable it will fetch you tips

00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:41,600
from testing and included in itself in

00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:44,120
the inner daddy's at builds etc no other

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,950
package I know off in Yakov actually

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:50,750
does that so in theory if it would be

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,509
possible to just do the normal thing

00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,429
like you upload to unstable you have

00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:57,080
stuff from unstable and you migrate it

00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:59,059
that would be nice I don't know if

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,830
that's possible but that's really

00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:04,149
something I mean there are proposals on

00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:10,970
the list on how to do it

00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:13,549
yeah it's not a release impression but

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:16,909
the DI team can use manpower they really

00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:20,240
can use manpower if you're I mean

00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:23,179
working on the Installer is not hard

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,759
they have their check out script you

00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:30,200
have really lot of packages but working

00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:32,480
on it is documented and it's actually

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,279
pretty easy if you have qemu on your

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,559
machine you can put up an install and

00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:38,559
check if your changes worked yeah

00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:43,779
anything releases

00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:51,230
thank you
