so welcome everyone this is a off about

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,370
how to get your packages into Debian it

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,580
is being presented by David Bremner and

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,810
was based heavily on notes by Ashish

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,660
Leroy who is not with us right now

00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:24,180
but he's fine he's just probably just on

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,380
his way out he's got other conferences

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,210
to go to so yeah this is gonna be there

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,830
probably will be a bunch of questions

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,450
and discussion I'll be running a

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,710
microphone so that your questions can

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,110
reach the folks out on the internet too

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,070
if people are following along online so

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:48,629
welcome David thanks yeah

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,899
funny story about this buff a few weeks

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:54,210
ago Arno and I were chatting on IRC and

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,570
said hey should we have another sponsors

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,170
buff and I looked at Penta and I said oh

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,300
great

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,470
Ashish is doing one so we don't have to

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:09,869
do anything well and and yet Here I am

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,670
so anyway buffs don't have to be too

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,990
organized right because it's all about

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,830
or audience participation I do have some

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,619
slides to to get us started I think the

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,450
model of I talked for a while and you

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,570
fall asleep and then you wake up and

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,860
participate is suboptimal and it's not

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,600
as good so I really encourage you if

00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,909
during this sentence you want to ask a

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,590
question you stopped me and say hey what

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,180
about you know why did you tell that

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,600
stupid story it was a waste of time

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,890
whatever you want to talk about right

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,850
okay

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:49,770
so right it's not a lecture even though

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,649
I'm standing up here lecturing that's

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,770
just because I can't reach the laptop

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,740
otherwise so what's it about well it's

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,590
about getting packaged sponsored so

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,770
uploading right for people who don't

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,259
have a magic key in in the uploading

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:12,030
keyring how do you get your packages

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,470
into Debian and I think I expect it's a

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,300
mix of people who are both

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,080
doing the uploading and doing sponsoring

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,870
and being sponsored here and I think we

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,910
can talk together about the process and

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:29,450
hopefully I think all of us can learn a

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:31,740
little bit about the process and maybe

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,280
think a bit about how things could be

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,290
improved because although I think we are

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
making some progress it's certainly

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,700
there's plenty of room to improve things

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:51,030
so I'm gonna talk a bit like I say

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:52,680
please stop me at any time I think to

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,930
encourage collaboration it would be

00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:03,480
great if as many of you as one to fire

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:06,450
up gobby so who is since this is maybe

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,300
the first buff of the conference let's

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:15,110
take some meta buff time and and get

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:18,290
people everybody has go be installed or

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:25,320
anybody needs help getting it installed

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:30,420
there's help it's ok then just pause a

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:35,670
few minutes so I guess do we have

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:39,390
somebody to speak for the people on IRC

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:44,190
I do know an IRC right ok so general is

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:45,840
ash Deb gaunt - talk room 1 right so

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,540
some of the people who actually know

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,450
about this topic should be hopefully

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,690
show up on that channel to answer

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:57,630
questions so it may be it's not only

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,400
people on IRC want to ask us questions

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,830
but we want to ask people on IRC

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:11,400
questions as well and once you fire up

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:18,690
gobby then you can look under DEFCON 12

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:21,510
buff packages into Debian so would

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,479
anybody be kind enough to volunteer to

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,470
make some notes for some minutes or keep

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,640
some notes on

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,640
what we're gonna talk about nobody

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,000
should I just start naming the people in

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:53,430
the audience I know until one of them

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:58,440
volunteers it's a good plan Alex is

00:04:53,430 --> 00:05:01,890
volunteering preemptively very good okay

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,870
so and I think it's not a rule that only

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,670
Oryx is allowed to edit this you'll see

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:10,410
when you get there there's a big mess of

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:12,750
notes that we widel eat them but we can

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:21,180
just start the minutes at the top if we

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:25,980
have minutes okay so any meta questions

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,930
about editing with Gabi or it's it's

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,440
pretty straightforward it's not Emacs or

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,920
VM that's very sad but well anyway

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,770
there's a long sad story about that but

00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:44,160
okay so um why should we care about

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:49,320
sponsoring well if we look at Sid we

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:52,920
have about 19 thousand packages and we

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:56,100
see that about 3,000 of those are

00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,500
sponsored so it's a noticeable fraction

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,760
and I'm willing to bet that every one of

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,230
you would miss some package in that set

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,890
if it went away

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,900
I mean he would say oh I can't it

00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:16,230
doesn't exist anymore what happened to

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:19,350
my favorite mmm editor game what have

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,630
you um maybe not all of them you would

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,390
miss that's true in general I guess for

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,760
a random sample of 3,000 packages in Sid

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,460
that some of them you would miss some of

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,950
them you don't understand the point of

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,260
that's Debian right I mean we don't all

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,780
have to like all the packages you notice

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,680
not so many of them are nm use so only

00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,710
about a hundred and forty or an amuse in

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,270
general there's a big barrier for people

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:50,610
being sponsored within amuse

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,250
it's a social barrier there's no

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,830
technical barrier to having sponsored an

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,870
amuse we can talk about whether that's a

00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:04,259
good dad I don't know it certainly

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:07,169
exists it's even more impressive I guess

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,570
or or convincing if you think about the

00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:12,360
people involved so it turns out that

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:16,169
most people who are having packages

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:19,430
sponsored are not uploading say like

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:26,160
Greg or 3,000 packages or however many

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:31,349
know 1000 anyway so so most people maybe

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,030
three or four packages and well it's a

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:35,430
lot of work to get packages sponsored

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,000
right so you can see why

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,820
and generally I guess as people get more

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,509
and more involved maybe they become

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:51,300
Dedes this is so sponsored here I'm not

00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,979
sure because I stole these statistics

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,970
I'm not sure if that's counting DM

00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:58,020
uploads or not that's kind of an

00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:02,310
interesting question now that I think

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:05,699
about it okay so how about the audience

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:08,099
how many people have never had a package

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:14,400
uploaded to Debian but think they might

00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:16,169
like to in the future great so there are

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,940
some other tutorials I know

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:22,080
Gunnar's running some tutorials on

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:24,180
packaging and so in this setting there's

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,830
going to be a big step where I say do

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:31,800
packaging which is somehow not covered

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,919
here but definitely there's plenty of

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,539
help for that available so by the end of

00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,200
Def Con fighting queue should be able to

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:43,380
know everything you need to know which

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:47,100
is a really nice head start

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,170
most of the what you need to know for

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,300
packaging is much better documented than

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:55,170
what you need to know to deal with the

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:59,610
bureaucracy say of getting or the social

00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:01,410
context of getting packages uploaded all

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,509
right so these statistics I

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,119
it's not critical right but but gives

00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:11,579
you some idea that that sponsoring

00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:16,019
matters I think that I often think that

00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:18,029
it matters more as a source of people

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,889
and as a source of contributors to

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,279
Debian then as a source of packages I

00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:24,779
mean it certainly matters for both but

00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:29,569
when we seen we have as many people

00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:32,849
involved as sponsor ease as we do DD's

00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:35,669
then then that's clear that that's you

00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:37,739
know it's a big impact it also means

00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:39,269
that since most people who sponsor

00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:41,129
sponsor three or four people there's

00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:44,909
lots of people who don't sponsor anybody

00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:46,949
right okay I'm not trying to make you

00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:51,989
feel guilty but if you do feel guilty

00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:55,739
then I don't feel guilty about that okay

00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:57,929
so this is a mix of things this both

00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:59,999
well so far it's not really Buffy but

00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:09,869
please feel to make it more Buffy

00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:11,549
Luciano perfect Oh also someone who

00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:22,409
could teach me to use events that would

00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:24,689
be awesome you want to be a potential

00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:26,069
sponsor great yeah and I should not have

00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:28,289
skipped that question because I know at

00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:30,359
least one more person in the room came

00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:32,789
up to me beforehand and said is this

00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:37,470
part of what's going on and and

00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:39,359
absolutely this is so what's involved

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,119
with sponsoring from a mechanical point

00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:45,299
of view I mean there's packaging quality

00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:48,659
control which you probably know about

00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:50,579
right I mean I I guess so

00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:53,459
but then there's procedural stuff which

00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:57,799
is which is less obvious and it's also

00:10:53,459 --> 00:11:00,809
keeps changing so okay so let me ask

00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:03,119
that question which I should have asked

00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:10,060
before how many potential sponsors or

00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:12,820
people who are already sponsoring so

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:16,450
and if you feel extra honest how many

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:21,250
people who could sponsor but don't want

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,700
to think it's too much trouble or fair

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,970
enough

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,980
no it's good I feel that way myself

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:31,839
mostly

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:37,330
except when I'm sponsoring so I don't I

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:40,660
sponsor I tend to sit I tend to take

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,640
three or four or five packages and

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:47,020
sponsor them and I sponsor all the

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,520
uploads and until that user becomes a DM

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,770
or they don't need my help anymore

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:56,410
that's that's my own personal style

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:59,529
other people I mean other sponsoring

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:03,190
happens in team contexts so I think we

00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:06,160
have about half of the or more of the

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,230
active members of the Perl team here so

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:15,279
I won't embarrass them by saying what a

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:17,680
great team that is but it is and it's

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,980
also been very successful at bringing

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,010
developers into Debian I came into

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:28,950
Debian through at least partly through

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:34,930
the package Perl team Salvatori I guess

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:39,160
you came that way - yeah so it's a it's

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:43,420
a success story there are other success

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,459
stories somehow so because we don't want

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,080
to get too conceited on on the Perl team

00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:49,990
we have to admit that somehow it's

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,060
easier Packaging Sipan modules than a

00:12:49,990 --> 00:13:01,270
lot of these other teams it's so

00:12:52,060 --> 00:13:04,250
homogeneous okay right so yeah

00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:07,730
okay so what's the big picture well the

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:11,150
first thing you notice or I notice when

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,570
when people come to the Debian mentors

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:18,470
IRC channel is there's kind of command

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:21,790
line shock people are used to tools like

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:25,280
Launchpad where you can initiate

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:27,860
processes entirely through the web it's

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,860
not going to work like that for Debian

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,560
right now and maybe never I don't know

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,980
it doesn't seem to be moving that way

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:42,740
right so we like it apparently right

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:48,080
right so fine but it's it's it's a first

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:50,090
step to adapt to and I guess I'm one of

00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,650
the people that thinks well you know the

00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,600
whole process is going to be quite

00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:58,810
command-line oriented anyway so you

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:02,930
might as well just get used to it okay

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:07,940
so the next step file an intent to

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:10,730
package you have found some package that

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:14,420
you want to package for Debian and you

00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:17,720
file a bug this does a few things it

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,360
helps avoid people packaging in parallel

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,760
which can be a bit frustrating if you

00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,330
invest a lot of time and then somebody

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,410
else scoops you with the upload

00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,200
eventually you learn to be less attached

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,950
to to maintaining packages but it's

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:36,500
still irritating we could all find other

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:40,250
things to do with that time so one of

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:44,320
the things you can go package you can

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:49,520
get help from Debian mentors IRC channel

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,520
or from the Debian mentors list I guess

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:56,240
for sort of questions about how do I do

00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:59,240
X packaging it's usually faster to do it

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,570
on IRC and people there are quite

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,950
helpful some of those helpful people are

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:12,830
here and some of them are hopefully on

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:14,410
IRC in debconf talk room one now one

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,920
thing that you'll discover

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:21,250
that and I'll talk a bit more about this

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:25,180
is that intensive package get feedback

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:30,250
from from Debian developer back is

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:32,949
almost always negative so sorry about

00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,870
that that's I'll explain why this is

00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:39,189
some how the system is set up this way

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:41,379
so just you know brace yourself you'll

00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:43,899
either be ignored or people will yell at

00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:50,350
you so ignore it is actually the good

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:52,569
case at this step then we have mentors

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,660
Debian net is the central place for

00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:59,199
uploading packages and it runs some

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:02,800
basic quality assurance checks it runs

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:05,410
Linton it does some other things and it

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,029
helps organize things so one of the

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,370
things I want to briefly mention is sort

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:16,149
of ongoing work with with that and

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:18,100
finally well not finally okay so one of

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:20,920
the things that's changed recently is we

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:24,790
started processing sponsorship requests

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:28,089
via the bug tracking system it's not

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:30,939
mandatory so many things in Debian it's

00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:36,899
not mandatory but it seems to be the the

00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:40,060
way things are done right now and so

00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:42,250
I'll talk a bit more about that then

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,980
there's this stage after you wait for

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,899
after you ask for sponsorship

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,959
you'll get more feedback and this

00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:51,370
feedback will actually be friendly so so

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,870
don't panic

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:58,290
the the it's it's confusing because the

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,389
audience of the request for sponsorship

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:04,120
understands it's a new package you're

00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:06,189
probably a new package er and maybe

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:10,000
there's some mistakes that we all make

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:13,959
and they will typically be friendly

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,020
about that the audience for the intent

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,480
to package doesn't make any distinction

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,699
between packages from new packages and

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:26,459
packages from people like me who should

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:29,500
know better but sometimes don't

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:34,179
okay finally the package gets uploaded

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,799
and well then you then that's another

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:39,460
talk right what happens after the

00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:44,470
package is uploaded you fix bugs and so

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:47,160
on okay I see them way over time and

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:50,260
nobody's asking any questions at all

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:58,210
okay you have a question excellent

00:17:50,260 --> 00:18:03,480
oh you just in case so okay so all you

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:07,720
people who are interested in uploading

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,710
does the big picture okay maybe there's

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,210
too much yes

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:15,250
other exterior interested in uploading

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:17,950
very good I will sponsor you maybe so I

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,510
have a question what induced deaths

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:26,290
which one do you think is now the

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:29,290
bottleneck the bottleneck is that after

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:31,390
requests for sponsorship are filed then

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:36,400
somebody has to actually sponsor the

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:40,110
package and there's more requests than

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,880
there are people doing this sponsoring

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:47,700
so it's not a we don't have somehow I

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,700
don't think there's a technical fix

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,260
maybe we should make Phil ask a question

00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:02,650
cuz he just wandered in he doesn't look

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:06,800
very keen on that okay another question

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:12,440
JP so I'm showing off that I know his

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:23,330
name cuz he's staying in my hotel one

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:27,370
slide when you're packaging something do

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:33,080
you have to coordinate with them first

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:35,440
is the process change because of that so

00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,050
so the question is suppose you're

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:46,820
updating I guess a package or packaging

00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:50,620
a new package so it's a new package new

00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:55,040
package there's a ruby team debian team

00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:57,800
coordinated with them first you probably

00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,850
should because as soon as you write a

00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:04,190
generic request for sponsorship the

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:08,150
first thing that people are going to say

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:11,840
is have you talked with this team and

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:14,870
that team because sponsors are a scarce

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,190
resource and at least in principle teams

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,670
are a good way of getting things

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:25,220
sponsored that's how people are going to

00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:28,400
direct you anyway so I mean it would

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:31,010
certainly be fine to CC the team mailing

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:38,390
lists with your request for sponsorship

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:40,670
I think in in Debian there's no rule

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,950
about all games must be packaged by the

00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,620
games team and all rubygems must be

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,810
packaged by the group and in practice

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:52,310
there are people who do and don't but

00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:53,870
it's there's already enough friction in

00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,550
the process that you want to find the

00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,190
smoothest way and I think the smoothest

00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:00,860
way is almost always working within the

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,690
team Daniel I just want to add that it's

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,540
not just about being the smoothest way

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,730
but that those teams actually

00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,710
to have a lot of experience and have

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,330
probably struggled with some of the same

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,140
things that you struggled with in

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,170
packaging like a symbol like ruby gems

00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,150
like ruby gems or like games the games

00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,070
might have a similar set of issues

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,110
around licensing that you didn't expect

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,080
or they might have a similar set of

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:30,220
issues about ways to integrate them into

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,450
the Debian menu or whatever I don't

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,830
actually know what details are with the

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:38,200
games licensing of artwork right yeah so

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,270
so talking to the team is not just a

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,310
clever way to find someone who would be

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,260
a sponsor for you although it is that

00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,090
but it's also a good way to find someone

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,160
who can actually give you advice on the

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,010
parts that you were less sure about in a

00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,200
package right right so that's a really

00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,720
good point and I guess to sort of wrap

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,030
those two things together the point is

00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,860
not that the teams are an administrative

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,860
barrier but that there are resource Oh

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,260
any other questions okay

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:18,020
so we just did this right okay

00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,880
so intent a packet and I sort of

00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:26,600
foreshadowed this and we had a recent

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:32,150
discussion on I guess Debian develop

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:33,830
rope reott responses are and so people

00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,240
often find software that they think is

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,720
really cool and they want to contribute

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:42,290
it to Debian and that's great and then

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:49,640
they're a little surprised that Debian

00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:51,980
doesn't want it so well that's so so

00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,660
these intent to packages don't have

00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,940
anything to do with sponsoring per se

00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,310
right everybody who makes a new package

00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,620
for Debian Debian developer not

00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:03,200
developer is supposed to make one to

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,990
avoid this duplicated work and also to

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,990
allow some kind of sanity check there's

00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,150
still a final sanity check by the FTP

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:15,530
masters before the actual upload happens

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:20,150
but like everything else in Debian we

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:24,350
like to metal so it's part of the sort

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:29,960
of group control over what packages are

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:36,920
going in so I don't know what the right

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:40,430
answer is people have suggested that we

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:45,260
are unreasonable about how we respond to

00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:49,430
two new into I guess recently opened up

00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:54,170
a debate about this I don't know I don't

00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:57,080
think that we necessarily are in this

00:23:54,170 --> 00:24:00,560
room going to change that that it's a

00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:04,850
cultural thing in in Debian and I think

00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:08,240
it's part of our self perception of

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:11,960
technical excellence is that we reserve

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,920
the right to be honest about the worth

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,500
of a new package and sometimes the new

00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,050
packages I have to be are from my point

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,660
of view I'm slightly dodgy right though

00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:26,150
or extremely dodgy

00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:31,250
so I think some this some level of this

00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:33,260
feedback is necessary and the best thing

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,420
that I can think of right now but I

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,990
think this is actually a good spot to

00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:41,780
open the floor up and and at least

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:47,510
briefly see if people have any other

00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:52,340
feelings or feelings ideas which is just

00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:55,059
to sort of be warned that when you throw

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,559
an intent to package out there you're

00:24:55,059 --> 00:25:02,570
throwing into the deep end of the pool

00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:05,150
of the Debian social process which can

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:09,550
be a little more rough and ready than

00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:16,160
say the debian mentor's list so anybody

00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:19,059
well find that blatantly false or so I

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,440
guess one way that I look at the

00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:24,890
difficulties about getting a new package

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,450
into debian is that when you say hey

00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,990
here's this package that I made I think

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,760
it should be in Debian the people who

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,230
received that are probably thinking

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,660
about it slightly differently they're

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,760
not hearing I want this package that I

00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,860
just made to be in Debian but they're

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,640
hearing a request that something goes

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:46,730
into Debian and Debian will maintain it

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,050
and package maintenance if new versions

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,420
come out or if there are problems

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,520
reported with the package maintaining a

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,740
package is actually an additional chunk

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,920
of work beyond the first action of

00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,110
packaging and so some of that pushback I

00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,150
think that you see with a new package is

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:04,850
pushed back saying are you really

00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,590
committed to maintaining this thing

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,720
because if we put it into the archive

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,429
and then there's a problem with it or a

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,820
new version comes out and it needs to be

00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:15,260
uploaded are you gonna step up and say

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,420
yeah I'm going to continue to maintain

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,400
this thing that I sponsored that that

00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:23,570
got sponsored in or is it going to

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,370
become a old stale package that's not

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:30,020
actually being actively maintained and

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:33,210
so if you if one of the ways that I find

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:36,090
I can think about that resistance is

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:38,220
a little bit of a test to see how

00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:40,020
committed you are to maintaining and I

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,270
know that's not a very polite way to do

00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,159
the test but if you look at it that way

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,809
you can say listen I am committed to

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,149
maintaining this package for at least

00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:50,880
the next release cycle about two years

00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:52,830
I'm gonna try to fix the problems with

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,679
it and if you can communicate that back

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:58,500
I suspect that you will find the barrier

00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,480
the resistance to be much lower if you

00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,380
if you take the time to communicate your

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,380
commitment to maintenance

00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:14,940
any other comments so I guess you if you

00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:17,880
hang around long enough you will hear

00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,909
the term vanity package tossed around in

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,010
a derogatory way to refer to a package

00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:27,179
that is of interest really only to its

00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:31,260
uploader and that's not always so

00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:33,539
obvious to the uploader but one thing

00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:37,289
when you're thinking about what should I

00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:39,870
you know I found this great thing and I

00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:42,630
think it should be in Debian think about

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:45,149
what's the community for this package we

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,820
have lots of very specialized software

00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:49,940
in Debian and I think personally I think

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,260
that's one of the things that drew me to

00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:55,710
Debian was that the specialized software

00:27:52,260 --> 00:28:00,299
that I needed for my work was a lot of

00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:03,270
it was already in Debian but at least I

00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:06,149
can imagine there are some people at

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:09,179
least in a work setting like me who need

00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:11,059
this same kind of software so when you

00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:14,909
think about what makes a great package

00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:16,919
part of the sales pitch I mean it's it's

00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:19,409
a kind of sales job to say hey this

00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,899
thing should be in Debian is well look

00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:24,470
it has this big user community right or

00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:26,730
it has a user community of more than one

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:29,640
somewhere between those two statements

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,970
it gets more convincing towards big but

00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:36,750
you know if you say look there's there's

00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,190
you know a small group of us that that

00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:42,029
use this software but it's really

00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:44,750
important in domain X and then then I

00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:44,750
think that's enough

00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:53,070
okay so another thing that that can

00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:55,290
happen is occasionally our request for

00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:58,500
sponsorship if the discussion just

00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:00,270
Peters out and there's nobody really

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,220
expressing interest in sponsoring it

00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:07,260
then those bugs can be closed which is

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,260
obviously not so nice as the person who

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:14,760
asked for sponsorship on the other hand

00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:17,160
it is a response to something that are

00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,980
no asked last year when he was a

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:24,300
frustrated sponsoring rather than now

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:26,820
he's a frustrated sponsor which was you

00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,800
know if something's never gonna be

00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,400
sponsored then it would be better to

00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:36,020
find out earlier rather than let the

00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:39,510
whole process drag out for four months

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,610
so this is a bit experimental it doesn't

00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:44,370
happen very often

00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:47,130
I guess Ansgar is the expert right you

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,170
close we there have been maybe five or

00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,820
six times in the last six months that

00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:54,510
that our request for sponsorship has

00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:57,210
been closed and typically this has not

00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:59,340
been packaging issues so I would say

00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,890
that whatever packaging issues you have

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,620
people on the mentors list so don't

00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:10,460
panic people on the mentors list will

00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:14,100
teach you to package and end on IRC so

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:18,930
but what sometimes happens is that the

00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:23,550
upstream software itself fails what to

00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:27,600
to some kind of consensus of developers

00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:30,780
fails a certain sanity level so and and

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:34,410
then it doesn't then then that might

00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:39,090
happen but I say as I say it's pretty

00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:42,930
rare and it's more going back to this

00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:45,990
question of what's good software to to

00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:50,040
upload to Debian and software that that

00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:51,870
has a community with some exceptions is

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,690
is generally

00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,290
more or less meets these sanity checks I

00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,350
guess

00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:03,810
PHP is the big exception there but all

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:07,850
right my biases are showing okay so any

00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,850
questions about this I mean it's it's um

00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,490
like I say the the feedback from intent

00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:17,010
to package could be discouraging but I

00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:22,830
think as Daniel says you have to see it

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:25,920
in the context of your being treated on

00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,700
the same level as every Debian developer

00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:33,890
with what you propose to be in Debian

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:36,360
DGA one thing that made me think is

00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:38,130
maybe the problem is not the package

00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,710
that gets up that ends up being

00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,140
maintained by Debian the thing is what

00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,150
we need for a package to be reasonably

00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,850
intelligent is that we need someone to

00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:50,070
take care of it over the years and I

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,020
mean what we don't need is someone just

00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,740
uploading and disappearing after one or

00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:58,350
two upload and I wonder if we recommend

00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,630
communicating this these commitments

00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:03,180
that you have to your package correctly

00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:05,100
because I mean once you upload to

00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,800
unstable if you're at the start of the

00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,810
3yz you have to wait like one year for

00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,290
the freeze plus six months for the

00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:15,240
release plus two years plus one year for

00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,100
the package to stay in stable including

00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,800
security support so that's just three

00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:22,770
years commitment that you have to do

00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:26,340
otherwise this will just end up being on

00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:28,410
others shoulders so I mean it's quite

00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,980
it's quite big I mean even for small

00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:33,600
packages you might end up doing a stable

00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,610
stable release for something and that

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,090
you have to handle security whatever

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:42,600
blah blah and yeah I've just wondered I

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:45,480
I don't know I I have the impression

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:50,240
that it was in the new maintainer guide

00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:55,380
but it certainly is something to stress

00:32:50,240 --> 00:33:00,120
that what you're committing to is you

00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:02,740
know is a long-term thing feel free to

00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,920
put it in the minutes

00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:09,470
in your opinion what what are the

00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,840
gadelle guidelines who decide whether a

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:16,460
package is good or not good for their

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,140
women if their game is interested so for

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,940
better or worse it's completely

00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:24,680
subjective

00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:27,910
that's worries and buts okay

00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:37,490
it shouldn't have obvious security flaws

00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:39,760
it should have a user base some size it

00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:43,970
should this is somewhat controversial

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:47,450
but I think that if it duplicates an

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:49,460
existing package then it should

00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:53,240
differentiate itself in some way it

00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:55,580
should provide some value to to the

00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,130
users of Debian - to have another I

00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,500
think we had this long-running still

00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:05,060
have this long-running joke right about

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:07,400
a file D duplicator D duplicator package

00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:10,820
because we have so many file D

00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,220
duplicators in the archive and of course

00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,460
in in practice I suppose many of them

00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:19,820
have different strengths and weaknesses

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,620
but when you bring up a new file D

00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:25,070
duplicator and you ask for it to be

00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,899
sponsored you should know it's good to

00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:32,149
know what's in the archive already and

00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:34,940
say well I think this combines the best

00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:38,750
of these other ones or it's bet faster

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:48,649
or you know you should have some reason

00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:52,010
for it to exist Thanks sure so Kusanagi

00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:54,139
on IRC says I don't really see the

00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:57,040
problem if someone is not committed for

00:34:54,139 --> 00:35:00,200
two years it's work that's being done

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,880
take take it out if the maintainer

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,370
disappears fast but keep it where

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,540
someone can take it over this is a

00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:10,800
comment from IRC right considering

00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:14,250
so so that's a kind of counterpoint to

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,670
the orthodoxy that though that we

00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:19,440
expressed to be clear the PERT the the

00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:22,260
speaker is someone who has been trying

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,410
to get a package sponsored and has known

00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,000
had it happened yet right okay so no

00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,250
phony we wants to address that

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,820
yeah well the the thing is that this

00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:34,770
burden of detecting this package that is

00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,510
not more nothing anymore maintained and

00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:39,000
having it removed and blah blah blah

00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,619
this stills Falls up on the shoulders

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,440
not of the maintainer that disappeared

00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:45,780
it just falls on the shoulders of Debian

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,359
and the release team and the FTP masters

00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,820
and stuff and it's boring work that no

00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:52,290
one's wants to do and it's better if

00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,050
packages stay in shape and stay

00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:59,310
maintained and then some relying on

00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:01,500
someone else going to see if if we can

00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,540
remove this package so maybe we should

00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,579
also teach people to say okay if you're

00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:11,579
leaving Debian please leave with the

00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:13,470
packages I don't know so going back to

00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:16,410
my original question about who thinks

00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:19,619
sponsoring is just too much work this is

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,599
actually something that discourages

00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,900
people I think from sponsoring or some

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,569
people I've talked to is this sense of

00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:31,650
responsibility for for the packages that

00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:33,420
you upload I don't know what the right

00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:35,819
answer there is certainly this point is

00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,010
well you can always just if your sponsor

00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:41,910
Reid disappears you can always file for

00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:44,630
removal of the package but you know

00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:47,670
removal of packages is also not

00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:49,200
cost-free it has a social cost if

00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:54,329
nothing else somebody's using that

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,430
package right and any so I think almost

00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:58,589
every package well not every package but

00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:00,810
many times there's controversy about

00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:04,260
whether a given package should have

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:06,630
really been removed just because it

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,180
seems the maintainer is not active or

00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:11,579
and it had so I mean if you remove a

00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:15,180
package that has no release critical

00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:16,470
bugs then somebody will criticize this

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:22,080
decision for

00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:24,869
correctly so another question is does

00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:28,700
the package need to be in English if

00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,700
Spanish is the main language is it okay

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:37,320
that is I guess that's a policy question

00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:41,460
right and I guess I don't know the

00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:46,070
answer somebody here knows and scarf put

00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,070
your FTP master hat on and it doesn't

00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,869
the microphones coming

00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,890
I think we don't need that but at least

00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:06,260
the copyright notice and description

00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:09,410
need to be in English because we need to

00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,360
read it and of course it's way easier to

00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:14,240
find a sponsor if the package is

00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:18,680
actually in English because the audience

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,020
is just greater sure okay so was that an

00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:28,910
answer for the person on IRC I guess the

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:32,000
oh hello I can also say something maybe

00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:34,490
on removing packages it's I think it's

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,450
not wrong to remove packages early

00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:41,300
because if people notice it it's more

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:44,150
likely that maybe they will take over

00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:46,910
maintenance because well if the package

00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:50,360
is actually removed from Bevin it's not

00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:52,340
like it can't be reintroduced it's a

00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,710
very good point and I think some of us

00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,990
feel like someone has died when a

00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:59,630
package removed but actually all it

00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:03,190
needs is another upload to revive the

00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:06,860
zombie package so it's not so serious

00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:09,989
being removed that's an excellent point

00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,989
[Music]

00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,600
okay

00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:24,540
so we now have this VTS setup and I

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,790
think that I should talk quickly but no

00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,510
I I planned on running out of the slides

00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:34,020
right or time so that's good

00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:36,570
so you can use reportbug' if you're

00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:40,410
packaging for Debian you will learn to

00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:42,360
know and tolerate reportbug' because

00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:45,660
it's just way easier than making up the

00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,220
mail messages yourself and that is a

00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:53,700
sales pitch if I ever heard one

00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:58,260
so oops so one thing that's new is you

00:39:53,700 --> 00:40:00,840
have different severity for different

00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:05,670
kinds of bugs so release critical bug

00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:08,100
fixes normal for updates and wish list

00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:14,580
for new packages so this feels a bit

00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:16,020
like discrimination it is but so since I

00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,180
don't have much time let me just mention

00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:21,090
that so there's been mixed feelings

00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:23,790
about this experiment one thing which

00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:25,590
has been not so great is that there's

00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,690
been a lot more noise on the Debian

00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:30,300
mentors list machine generated messages

00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:32,220
which this is a technical problem and

00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,220
thankfully those kind of things we can

00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:37,620
fix and and we're just waiting for the

00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:41,370
list master to get some time to to set

00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:44,370
some things up and we will one thing I

00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:45,900
didn't realize until a few days ago when

00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:48,600
I made these slides up is it's actually

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:51,270
pretty cool that just having things in

00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,370
the BTS gives us a way to see how we're

00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:57,830
doing and I don't think we really had

00:40:53,370 --> 00:41:03,090
that easy access before so in six months

00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:05,790
we had 28 our C bug fixes sponsored okay

00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:11,040
it's not a huge number but it's not

00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:13,440
nothing either of the updates you can

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,750
see that it really works pretty well for

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,750
getting updates for existing packages

00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:26,400
172 out of say 210 so so that you can

00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,880
have some hope for you see it works less

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,009
well

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,490
four new packages and I think that's

00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:37,920
just about the process of getting

00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:41,069
packages into Debian most sponsors are

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:46,490
happier to sponsor existing packages and

00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:51,000
bug fixes for existing packages yes

00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:53,299
there's a comment from IRC that says you

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,710
can easily end up with non sponsored

00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:58,140
previously developer maintained packages

00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:00,450
which are now effectively orphaned it is

00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,160
real life that people vanish I do not

00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:04,319
see the necessary connection between a

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,849
sponsored orphan package and an

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,380
otherwise orphan package

00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:09,839
I think the person who's writing this is

00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:15,319
using the term orphaned loosely not sure

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:21,000
literature sense so that was a statement

00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:23,220
okay so I think here the good thing

00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,680
relating to that comment is that those

00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:28,799
packages would be counted under updates

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:32,490
here and would seem to be being

00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:35,099
processed reasonably well so whether

00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:37,819
they're orphaned I mean this doesn't

00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:41,930
distinguish who the maintainer is

00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:45,930
formerly although as we saw earlier

00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:47,940
there is this NMU barrier sorry then you

00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,400
enjoy the back of my shirt it's the same

00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:54,089
as the front you're all reading IRC

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,420
anyway so um so I guess we should I

00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:58,650
should stop and it's too bad that as she

00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,019
wanted to tell you all these great

00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:04,650
things about the new features of dev

00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:07,019
Expo and I will post the slides online

00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:11,069
and you can look at them there so I

00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:14,059
should should stop so we have time for

00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:14,059
maybe one question

00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:23,819
okay thanks a lot it was better than

00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:25,709
last year the sponsors buff so if we

00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:26,910
make it a bit better every year I think

00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:29,999
it helped that we didn't hold it on the

00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:32,219
last day in the evening so we're not

00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:34,349
tired as tired yet so thanks a lot

00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:36,000
everybody for coming and contributing to

00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:40,820
this ball

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,820
