	00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:13,120
package counsel took a tumble I guess

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,120
room in the middle

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,160
and

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,150
which might be because

00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:21,909
so that's essential to get all of it

00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:23,800
and you see this context Falls and most

00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:29,649
populous is powerful

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:39,129
looks a bit like in let's make things

00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:49,050
like like animation episode so we come

00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:49,050
back to the individual facts

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:54,470
okay again

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:38,050
changing the technical testing this is

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:46,840
annoying but don't put it in there I

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:49,840
have to see overly so they also we're

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,990
relying up for breakfast for petitions

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,750
III

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:58,290
these are actually local but that's

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:14,980
something about to humbly season up

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:19,530
languages and I change change deepest

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,530
from 0.40 open fire

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:10,400
I think the temperatures hassle ask that

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:16,070
you make them improve within the

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:24,710
structure because this point amended

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:30,830
approval and other devices contain which

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:36,530
I can understand okay so the time

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:42,980
how exciting these are propping the

00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:51,010
scepter do and I'll never you pinch so

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:59,210
what else is he making a detail with the

00:10:51,010 --> 00:11:04,930
Osprey you just text size of them is all

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,930
this presentation

00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:29,570
0:35 it's now very fuzzy this plan of

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,190
changing the miniatures make sense it

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:39,730
tells all that to be the dependencies

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:39,730
within it so something we would complain

00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:05,110
so the tools to use the template epic

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:27,240
directory and adjustment okay I go to

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:27,240
the specific kind of like a street name

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:58,120
template directory we can use loops are

00:12:51,760 --> 00:13:17,050
necessary in some of the uses so I

00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:17,050
devotion about this it's just too much

00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,930
that's all we don't have attention list

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:34,790
and this follows the main most in the

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:38,810
book I need to dependencies so we have

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:42,020
lived here for finding all of these

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:44,380
either I don't need this comment just

00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,380
Irvine

00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:07,340
so these have to I know biologists are

00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:14,590
provided by compiler itself let's face

00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:14,590
it potatoes directory to put the penis

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:32,190
follows so I put them in here and this

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:34,860
is 92 minutes and I just carry over the

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:37,920
it's very hot results from zero four

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:41,040
zero four eight zero eight exclusively

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,940
through practice and the same thing for

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,940
transformers

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:58,010
we spend too much time on them for the

00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:01,310
values Anderson people think we could

00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:08,270
use a little ease and but they expect to

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:11,860
hear a feel so just copy them it's a bit

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,860
more complicated because it

00:16:45,850 --> 00:17:17,809
to change but the tactical situation we

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:21,679
can such a bill or donation that helps

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:24,410
me managing several packages so take

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,990
this you before I take this for

00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:35,030
years and I can take so at the same time

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:38,240
to say and then I can master but what's

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:42,850
to say must focus for a successful thing

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,850
do it so take this

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,770
most tricky thing we might know that the

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:57,679
doctrine in another capital T so in this

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,679
case without one has to history photo

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,600
and

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:27,590
the use of this all the man that you

00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:28,759
deserve in secrets of destruction so he

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,389
wonders of the destruction

00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:31,389
indefinite

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:49,720
try to acquit not function to run this

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:51,550
test signatures and people are very fine

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:57,880
an upgrade from safety to this version

00:19:51,550 --> 00:20:02,460
without reading it this is metadata and

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:06,130
it was upset and he can pass the

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,500
additional depends the new package that

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:13,900
this you go to be canceled

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:19,860
therefore yours in the ring so this to

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,860
the farm and

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,760
yeah

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:33,410
with all the entities are so expensive

00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:38,380
and it's always ministry and for fees

00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:40,760
and video the changes sometimes

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,800
unfortunately you ever never really

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:48,650
sucks to be uncommon Esquivel this is

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,750
yeah looks like they are the Texas which

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,860
is nice and of course I'm mostly

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:58,330
interested in the changes to the

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:58,330
government because this will tell me how

00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:05,469
there's a new money music this means I

00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:13,089
will have the salmon the moment I go to

00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:14,919
the changes here so I do upgrades which

00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:17,409
basically just figure out new version of

00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,979
alternative habit and it's the change

00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:21,359
forget you

00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:23,979
and then what if I'm the control file

00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,459
this is not a baby anymore we don't eat

00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:36,639
this anymore

00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:38,079
and we know that it has changed it would

00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:42,369
be strange but not never

00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:46,539
so we also want to depend on mega to th

00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:48,789
and box in an arbitrary version okay

00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:50,799
I've seen things that's fine and it's

00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:53,589
worked with this writer and this is

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:57,839
changing politics let's fix this and

00:22:53,589 --> 00:23:00,309
you're come up tonight take some tickets

00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,169
the virtual pages have been changed but

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:04,539
the object in a dependency on them on

00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:07,719
deep sex which is not small

00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:10,049
many of these mortgages we also put this

00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,049
video

00:23:32,880 --> 00:24:24,670
I know there has to vector the th one

00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:29,500
box that is not release it Texas for

00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:31,630
easy and this is come online even

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,780
actually deserve well for tens and

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:37,230
thousands of packages collecting after a

00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:40,870
simultaneously

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:43,780
okay so now let me go by all and make

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:45,960
sure that making the appropriate each

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,960
other

00:25:38,899 --> 00:26:02,759
in precise and help us to us things and

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,850
I'm gonna fix it defeated early as

00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:09,659
important as wanted to dissolve this

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:14,690
administrate so this is so

00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:14,690
step 6 that's your problem

00:26:17,710 --> 00:27:10,240
so why

00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,710
but

00:27:21,850 --> 00:28:20,540
yes okay I hope the changeless which

00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:28,750
protects posit Asians make sure people

00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:28,750
forget the taxes yeah

00:28:29,460 --> 00:29:20,470
okay and you also said she for example

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,170
no test means that we don't want to see

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,710
because they'd be able to wander the

00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,850
muscle as we do stupid or something else

00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:35,020
they cannot flex which are like

00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:39,240
configure flex here I love my team that

00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,240
will make us separately ignore that

00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:49,260
though we know places of the makers the

00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,260
compare

00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,950
this is the copy of all it is

00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:20,429
since Excel compatible for Debian Texas

00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,140
and the a fulfills what if I maybe care

00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:28,500
packages to make sure the data to the

00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:38,640
nice I can also cut out front snare that

00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:45,059
I've got up speed babysits for so with

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:47,340
this but testing modified in the

00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:50,970
metadata by hackers so that it looks

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:53,940
about that packet reports difference

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:55,470
with the Cabal fans in the power they do

00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,750
it so they can have taken an iterator

00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:04,880
there's a new feature it's great some

00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:04,880
more us to another technician variable

00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,390
the package to learn yeah

00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:17,490
it's also about wrinkles we have a set

00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,159
of Jenkins drops one of them is the

00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:24,289
package button and you can see that it's

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,289
currently subtility yeah

00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:42,470
and if not only get up Amelia so let's

00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:47,180
make sure that we recomm it's something

00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:48,710
that the team has I think about their

00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:54,280
relationship they do not detective

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:54,280
system the VCRs about possible changes I

00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:00,730
think everybody unmodified for years and

00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:09,320
I also have a question that the TTT

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:12,110
itself is kind of dormant that's useful

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:22,250
to know so if somebody feels working on

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:24,920
this there are crops that install all

00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:30,110
hangers packages which are the try sets

00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:33,890
of pictures unstable every month or

00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:36,260
performer for them is very increase it

00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,820
was a la técnica de nuevo the possible

00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,400
that he must sometimes was something

00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,200
that we didn't fix time so that is

00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,740
unfortunate

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,740
at least come in

00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,860
there's a

00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,649
this is the visual

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:47,240
because telling you how can you prove it

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:48,260
yeah it's like it's not for us I'll make

00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:53,809
sure I use it more

00:35:48,260 --> 00:36:05,660
thank you lord okay so the Trinity wants

00:35:53,809 --> 00:36:07,460
to take it the hard way that suits you

00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,579
think that pretty much just have the

00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:13,030
latest did you find that works enough

00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:13,030
people

00:36:42,090 --> 00:37:02,640
yeah but always thank you

00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,470
the check it there are like hundreds of

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,560
division tools for that the people can

00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:17,040
opt into we can human equation to use

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:18,660
these tools we really have the situation

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,340
very actually need is to go to the

00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:24,300
library yes we had in the past actually

00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:34,740
fired us

00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:46,170
pre enters the body for picture you see

00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:48,150
okay so this is what's available what

00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,040
our users you can see difference abuse

00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:54,200
has a very different set of factors so

00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,200
speed AMA is you as sound

00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:14,440
arbitrariness death so what's up the

00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:16,540
package obviously broken in size so he

00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,650
decides that the appendices fiber food

00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:26,140
that's a very compelling reason to make

00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:28,570
a bothers at Harveys contacted

00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:35,530
people many to not to use it it's

00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:37,270
reasonable to provide to the house to

00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:40,900
compile yourself because they depend on

00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:43,800
them on sila recent stuff which kebab is

00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:56,230
all by itself so confusing for me

00:38:43,800 --> 00:39:04,920
you just continue is basically the

00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:09,420
question what kind of

00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,070
who would use testificandum in Omaha's

00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:16,290
difficulties from using in Cabal install

00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:19,710
and Hawaii to the best for my good stuff

00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:22,070
for a critical Damian pathology user

00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:26,100
that doesn't exist maybe outside of home

00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:51,450
so again some person so a question from

00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:55,280
IRC was the second row the p12 only

00:39:51,450 --> 00:40:00,630
takes out this one second I guess

00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:09,480
restricting ourselves to encourage

00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:13,370
people to search problems before meet us

00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,370
when otherwise we'll be the first ones

00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,880
quickly over the question to the related

00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:22,920
question is whether there are things

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,860
that each does that and that that part

00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:33,720
of how does it help us something we may

00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:36,560
make it harder and easier to be

00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,940
successful I think

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,610
stay tuned to the end to anything

00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,210
differently but it should be more

00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:48,300
prominent and visible in the community

00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:51,150
what pages you sent were unsafe sending

00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:54,500
attention and anything right now there

00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,500
is one prostitute

00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:55,700
so generally in general very

00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:05,380
so maybe in this hospital in your

00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:07,299
favorite library all you know depends

00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,779
easy things my stuff that I needed that

00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:09,779
miracles

00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,090
otherwise fine

00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:20,050
general enormous the best containers

00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,050
these packages Silverland

00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,640
and

00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:24,709
so when I started out I didn't even

00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:27,529
accidentally much about past the leader

00:43:24,709 --> 00:43:29,359
I had the top of a lot of heart beating

00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:31,309
it's deadly I'm targeting something that

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,659
I want to be a distribution is that in

00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,880
front of all these levers and language

00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:43,359
that are pinned Indian so you go check

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:50,179
that night there should be I guess you

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:54,139
know creating a set of packages that the

00:43:50,179 --> 00:43:59,869
same poses to be used so nation and

00:43:54,139 --> 00:44:02,269
people can hopefully realize a bit while

00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:04,789
stable or the more usable than negative

00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:09,619
something I don't think we actually did

00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:12,349
talk to this yeah I mean I think partly

00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:15,709
to is you're looking at on history that

00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:18,930
mean hassle packaging wish it was more

00:44:15,709 --> 00:44:21,270
or less than useful few years ago and

00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:23,280
in everybody the habit of doing

00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,650
everything at that ball but I really

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,670
believe fan of the packaging and instead

00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:31,500
of things I and you can too to the

00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,530
bootstrap for a couple of reasons was

00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,900
that obviously commencement effort at

00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:40,380
all this with all your automation

00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:43,289
anything else to see instead of doing

00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:47,430
something other than action movies they

00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:49,799
care about but also because yeah I'm

00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:51,839
night I think that that said about it so

00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:54,210
it appears now you look at them all in

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,190
here there's a big there's less and less

00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,990
and less than every actors that bond

00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:02,869
installed and let me say the correct

00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:05,849
thing to get bootstrap right so long and

00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:07,349
give a sense of problems is that I

00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:09,480
certainly get it that there's a

00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:11,609
complicated set of questions here is my

00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:24,049
Symon super easy to answer I would say

00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:24,049
maybe thank you

00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,460
would do that too

00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:15,820
with the stable so basically you're

00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:22,340
gonna we're going to cut slice and time

00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:24,680
so just good for the house working maybe

00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:28,070
that's targeted for just packaging the

00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:34,670
corset part of this our new house to

00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:40,360
developers just need to track testing on

00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:47,210
things are useful for again occasionally

00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:49,370
we have only one minute left so I really

00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:56,950
like the ability to stay because people

00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:56,950
have given so it's so kind of a few

00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:06,560
let's see how okay yeah

00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:08,510
very good leader we can resolve in about

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,680
a week

00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:15,320
should we just package the commander for

00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,800
environment that's far exceeds useless

00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,900
and our feeling them was that maybe the

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,460
sort of the best for our users and maybe

00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,650
it would have put it the best you feel

00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:27,020
it's just even remember better than they

00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:30,200
need to do it ourselves but our feeling

00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:32,000
was perhaps this is sort of move toward

00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,590
step one of the distribution just down

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,510
today but we're doing okay

00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:40,040
if client foot stopped working at this I

00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,990
will stop talking if you would probably

00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,640
do less good maybe if I stopped working

00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:45,290
it and you get to switch to get to keep

00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:49,970
up with I don't know that makes a

00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:52,880
difference so maybe you can discuss that

00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:54,050
also in them all they are doing but

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,810
whether we actually need to actively

00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:59,060
kind of get more people to contribute in

00:47:56,810 --> 00:48:03,080
the job they can make it easier this is

00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:05,060
related I agree that class one it's just

00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,850
that I'm used to this one more minute I

00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:11,450
won't get an exemption this time so just

00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:12,050
just get out bottom to say it's minor

00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,730
things

00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,170
I guess if somebody would stand up and

00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,870
do all the conversion to get an update

00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:19,130
my scripts I wouldn't be in the way but

00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:21,470
as long as nobody's doing the work I

00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:25,090
don't care about enough I'll keep using

00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:27,560
that I guess at least for a while

00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:32,300
but it's not fundamental opposition it's

00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,950
just yeah somebody has to do it they

00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,570
could do it better on architectures so

00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:37,790
maybe that improves it has to becomes

00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:40,160
more more visible and more important

00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,600
with more products in Haskell shipping

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,360
in Debian maybe then taught us we get

00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,950
more interested in helping us there

00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,600
another thing that I'm I don't I'm not

00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:49,430
doing as good as I want to are you

00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,940
opponent please I guess that's you you

00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:54,110
put a point soon

00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:57,380
but I guess it's a long way thank you

00:48:54,110 --> 00:49:01,070
it's alright as one of the few porters

00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:04,340
has bothered the it's a very very high

00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:06,200
barrier to entry for reporters not

00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,230
saying they shouldn't but we probably

00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:12,660
shouldn't expect people to turn up and

00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:16,710
want to fix GHC unless they really enjoy

00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:20,069
intellectual puzzles so I mean I'm all

00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:22,230
for that but let's not have expectations

00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:25,710
too high there because it is very very

00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,240
difficult right so let somebody else do

00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,410
it okay I think you have to say thank

00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,690
the video team for giving us an

00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,400
extension and I think I'll finish the

00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:35,579
official part here and you can just keep

00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,609
sitting and what talking thank you good

00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,609
