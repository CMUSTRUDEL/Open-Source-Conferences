I'm kind of stood here telling you all

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:12,300
about stuff about the Installer and CD

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,620
team I was hoping that that we might

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,680
have had more people from the install

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,170
team around obviously Joey our grand

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,390
grand architect is here

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,180
Kibby unfortunately can't make it in

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,670
person but is probably going to be on

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,670
IRC and heckling right now knowing him

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,100
so I want to give you a quick update on

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,380
the status for both for what for both

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,129
sides of the Installer work what our

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,379
plans are particularly for Jesse of

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,680
course with the things we need help on

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,780
and I'll point those out as we go and if

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,100
there were any things that people here

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,960
would like to talk about if you've got

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,489
any more ideas if the things that you

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,440
would love to do for us and you're just

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,140
want wanting guidance on how to do it

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,469
and that would be awesome

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:03,480
please because I am sad to say getting

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,000
old my memory is deteriorating by the

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,670
day it seems please if somebody could

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,200
take notes or even all of you because

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,840
gobby is awesome and let you do that

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,560
take notes so we've got a record of this

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:24,600
discussion afterwards thinking so Debian

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:30,119
installer status excellent so we have

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:34,170
just about 2 weeks ago released Jesse di

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,540
b21 it's the first of the beaters that

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,799
we're going to do before Jesse I very

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:44,729
very much doubt it'll be the last the

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,979
wall known bugs there were some known

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,920
issues and the questions that were

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,259
already documented on the web please if

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,970
you can if you're interested go and

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,119
download some of the images and help

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,540
testing with them please report any

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,780
issues you find in as much detail as you

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,700
can because at the moment you know we

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,710
can't test all the hard work we can't

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,720
test all of the architectures ourselves

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,260
the more information we can get about

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,579
the possible issues the

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:17,470
better now in particular the wild

00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:20,409
worries about some architectures in the

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,510
which suggest that those architectures

00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:25,000
have not been tested very well at all in

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,060
the last say Yale maybe in two years

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,890
I know Kibby in particular you'll have

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,989
seen only your some of you may have seen

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,829
on the Debian boot list has been

00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:38,400
worrying about the K free BSD ports as a

00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:41,859
major thing though all quite a number of

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,079
major issues which we would have hoped

00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:46,180
if people were using this every day we'd

00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:54,510
have seen reported to folks already so

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:54,510
that ISM is a major concern thank you

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,129
that's also and again Kippy holds it

00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:07,420
hand up for this the scheduling of the

00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:09,069
releases of it the Installer has well

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,859
it's been an issue as long as we've been

00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:14,109
doing di and even going back to boot

00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,549
floppies before that we've had lots of

00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:17,500
discussions over the years and

00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,449
suggesting we should go for like a

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,389
monthly release cadence or we should go

00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,400
for a two-month cycle or something and

00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,790
everybody says yes that will be really

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,449
awesome

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,190
we might get though eventually what

00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:33,280
would be a really nice thing to do we'll

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,109
be able to do that and have di migrate

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,750
mostly through the archive as normal

00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:42,310
into testing it's never quite got there

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,310
one of the issues around that again is

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,049
manpower the more people we have

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,810
actually working on things and helping

00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:52,299
to test them and also can you know

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:57,959
contributing the bug fixes you know the

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:59,859
better so we have a number of plans

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,139
first things first

00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:04,750
we're just making the changes right now

00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:09,549
that we were talking about two three

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:11,739
four years ago the graphical installer

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,590
is going to be the default for Jesse on

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,639
those architectures words were supported

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,320
so specifically on x86 to be honest

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,909
again we've spoken about this for years

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,780
we just never got down to actually

00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,010
making it happen

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,900
we had a planet

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,330
confident irregular to say yes let's do

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,450
it and we kind of ran out of steam we

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,580
got sidetracked into other things it's

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,200
not just a case of it's pretty the

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,860
reason for the graphical installer being

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,650
preferred is there our number of writing

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,050
systems and there are a number of

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,180
languages that we just cannot support in

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:50,950
the text installer and we want to be

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:53,290
able to do a better job the default

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:57,430
desktop discussion has reared its head

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:59,170
again in the last few weeks and the

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,780
answers to be on this there's a lot more

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:07,320
heat than light Jerry wants to chip in

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,320
do we have a mic

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:19,550
so on the default desktop i beginning at

00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,710
that prompt I spoke with Russ and said

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,570
well what do you think the correct

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,070
procedure would be to find the default

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,740
that's not what spun the procedure

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,510
reversed and he pointed out the the

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,750
architecture pre-qualification that's

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,100
done by the release team is kind of

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,620
similar to what we want so what I've

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,940
come up with is a wiki page which allows

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,680
the various teams who have input to send

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,890
an input and then we get some kind of

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,330
criteria - and of course there are

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,830
certain issues like accessibility they

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,150
can just automatically defaulted dig

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,730
know if it does turn out that good was

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,420
the only option what I would like to do

00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:59,000
is schedule an ad hoc off later on this

00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,380
week and go over that wiki page and see

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,840
if there's some more options we want to

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,390
add and see what see what details we can

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,520
get and then hurry up with that decision

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:11,000
by the end of that poem for something in

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,380
that area or maybe the week after so

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,100
that's the default desktop and I'll be

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,510
scheduling that you know some sometime

00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,960
not tomorrow because cheese and wanted

00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,640
tonight some other fun okay and

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,280
regarding desktop choice which I see you

00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,590
also have up there the current status of

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:33,140
course is that a while ago friends pop

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:34,280
had put in syslinux menus to work around

00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,340
the fact that the ID is the one you

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,070
choose the desktop latency and some yeah

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,320
but we also have some other not

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,510
unrelated issues like the fact that some

00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,700
of the CD DS would like to be able to be

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,170
in the test so menu within that would so

00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,020
task so menu with all kinds of weird

00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:54,740
stuff yeah so I know the kibbe had

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,140
suggested because it's just suggested

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,090
now that he had earlier well we could

00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,530
think the desktop and then do you I

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,390
could say which desktop you want I

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,310
personally don't like that option just

00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,500
because it's then ASCII which of these

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,960
three options which if you were a new

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,660
real innings do you want it's another

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,670
strange mess of terminology to throw it

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,950
the user what I would refer to do is

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,170
have at the bottom of the lists of tasks

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,640
something that says more tasks or finer

00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,950
detail or something like that

00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,570
I sent opens up another window another

00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,240
menu where you can then say gnome KDE

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,370
xfc and also we have a whole slew of

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,170
other stuff and then but then you need

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,240
criteria for what actually fit in that

00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,910
list if someone has a good thought some

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,760
good thoughts about how to avoid that

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,740
was floating to 200 items which is not

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,570
gonna be usable it's just the default if

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,370
we have such a list I mean maybe that

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,990
would be a good one to do into doing

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,970
that that later buff as well but yet

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,650
we'll have a thing first um maybe I

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,630
don't know if that's a moth but maybe

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,850
sure oh maybe you know the buff but yeah

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,070
but I think the issue for getting this

00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:57,710
to happen in time for the release is

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,940
primarily going to be translations so

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,380
independently if some would like to

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,120
think about what that menu item should

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,340
say and get the wording and get it start

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,830
to be translated you just put the string

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,570
in tasks so right now and like christian

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,280
pair your work is magic and if we get

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,990
enough translations and we can have the

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,200
feature I think that's where at yeah

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,510
absolutely so I mean the the thing about

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,700
the default desktop that a lot of people

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,190
haven't don't still haven't understood

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,050
this for is I mean that I've seen them

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,840
quite a few people say why do we even

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,640
have a default desktop and and we must

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,229
have a default but whether even whether

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,870
some people think about it or not it

00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,159
think it's worth it or not

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,870
exactly for us Joey says for the people

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,520
frankly who don't know what they want

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,820
they just want to download Debian

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,120
install it without a default that's

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,120
impossible

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:49,550
[Music]

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,930
so artwork again this has come up quite

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,830
recently

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,510
Paul Tagliamonte a I have no idea how to

00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,620
pronounce his name so apologies if I've

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:03,170
just Paul tagged yes has is seems to be

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,960
on top of this there's going to be if

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,600
there's still quite a bit of work to do

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,430
once we actually have artwork that's

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,030
chosen because it needs to be put into

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:16,040
the white formats it's got to be set up

00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,390
it's not a huge amount of work but it's

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,350
going to take some time so don't expect

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,760
it to happen too

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:24,830
but this is it it's on the way there's a

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,540
whole lot of bug fixes we were already

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,300
aware of quite a few

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:33,890
for example there's there's issues with

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:39,680
the firmware support at the moment in

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:43,130
the Jesse's installer that's one that's

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,530
that's really important there's others

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,870
that are going to happen new

00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,730
architectures some people may have

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,220
spotted some people may not have done

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,290
that literally in the last fortnight

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:58,010
we've had to New York attaches

00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:02,930
introduced into unstable which is on 64

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:04,280
and PPC 64 we L both of the teams who

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,500
were getting those architectures

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,980
bootstrapped very much want them to be

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,020
in Jesse so those are probably going to

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,610
happen in the Installer very soon as

00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:18,320
well basically it's down to Porter work

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,780
as part of that if you're a package

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,590
maintainer you may end up being told

00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,090
your package needs fixes to be able to

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,820
to to build on one of these new

00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,710
architectures if you're involved if you

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,080
you have a package that is involved in

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,240
the installer at all obviously this is

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,760
going to be critical we're going to be

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,630
sending out on mail later today to

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:45,230
explain more what's coming secure boot

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:49,580
is again something we've been talking

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,230
about for at least two years we haven't

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,020
made a whole lot of progress on this

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,060
because it seems all of the people who

00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,690
know what to do here and have the skills

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:02,990
don't have the time I spoke to a guy

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:06,530
yesterday after Colin's grub buff who

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:10,220
said he's very keen to help our Aaron if

00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:12,470
he's around I guess he's not so I told

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,940
him to Mel Debian boot again if anybody

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,270
else wants to help with this that will

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,400
be awesome we're going to be discussing

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,800
this again later in the week I know

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,390
Steve and Colin and I maybe others will

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,890
be getting together to work out the

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,160
infrastructure we need and make sure it

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,730
happens we might have secure boot for

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,450
Jesse

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,100
it's

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,500
I've questioned marked it cause to be

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:38,930
honest it's not critical but it will be

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:41,920
nice to have last thing is the graphical

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:45,350
installer still used at GT k2

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,140
GT k2 is as I understand the deprecated

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,340
upstream everybody's been told go to GT

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,540
k3 it's much better

00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:55,070
wha-wha-wha we do need to move over the

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,700
bits of the graphical install over 2g

00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,010
tk3

00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,960
frankly if it happens for Jesse I'll be

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:06,320
a miracle unless anybody wants to go and

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:11,000
help do that so talking of help please

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,880
help we need help testing as I said we

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,530
have a vast number of options you know

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,990
for all of the possible Debian

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:20,210
installations out there there were paths

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,330
through the installer to get to that we

00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:26,900
cannot test all of these if you have an

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:30,230
architecture that basically KB and I

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,510
don't have at home we you need we need

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,270
you to help us test it if you come to us

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:39,980
after the Jesse release and say oh god

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:43,640
but what PowerPC doesn't work on my iMac

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,410
g4 or something we're going to be able

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,570
to do nothing for you at that point if

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,660
you tell us now we might be able to help

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:57,230
you fix it you know and that's critical

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:59,030
yes Wiki we have a microphone yeah I was

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,980
just gonna say the winter the souza

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,330
conference and they have the same

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,620
problem of testing the Installer and

00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,170
they have a whole lot of magic software

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,030
which actually runs through a large

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,590
proportion of the possible options to

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,570
check that they do actually appear and

00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,520
say what they should say and that's all

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,260
free software and you can write tests

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,810
and we should possibly actually look at

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,670
just using their tech for test coverage

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,300
if we were enthused thank you for

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,050
volunteering

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:26,090
Yeah right I'll put it on my list so yes

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,520
I would I just know just exists and it's

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,889
what we should probably look like okay

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,199
I'm

00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:35,489
it's cold right now but I could find out

00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:37,980
openSUSE magic something fine so again

00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:40,379
we need to help test you we don't

00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,559
necessarily need experts who can fix

00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,269
everything but we if we can't between

00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,119
those we can't even check that the

00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:49,559
Installer boots on some architectures

00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:53,699
it's very very difficult for us to go

00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,619
anything beyond that book handling the

00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:59,209
flip side of this of course is we're

00:13:55,619 --> 00:14:02,069
going to get bug reports posted for di

00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:03,899
we already have more di bug reports so

00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:09,059
we can possibly cope with must when I

00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:11,309
say we I mean Kibby he is tireless and

00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:14,309
was talking to me at like literally 6

00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,839
a.m. his time last night so I have no

00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:18,509
idea if he's awake or slumped over

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,730
keyboard somewhere but even even with

00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:23,339
one person not sleeping and doing 24

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:27,449
hours a day dealing with this we still

00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:30,089
need more help translations is always a

00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:31,980
place where we need more help as Jerry

00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:33,779
mentioned Christian is absolutely

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,759
awesome it's not just Christian

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,889
obviously it's Christian and his team of

00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,209
translators behind him but they always

00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,559
come and go there were always more

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,720
languages there were always more

00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,220
translations we need there were always

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,049
bugs in what we have whether it's

00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,889
software or translations or whatever

00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:51,449
again please dive in if you think that

00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,369
the particular translation that we have

00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:55,559
in Swahili for the Installer which won't

00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:58,339
tell us because we don't even know

00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,339
what's what he looks like

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,290
and there's plenty more stuff seriously

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:08,790
if you're interested and want to help

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:11,579
how di is a really cool project it's

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,379
nice and stable in that hey it works for

00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,779
most people but there are always more

00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:20,639
cool things we can do if we just have

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:23,579
the time to do it dive in so switching

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,410
over to my other hat Debian CD obviously

00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:28,429
these two are kind of related which is

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,429
why I've done the both together

00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:37,660
of course we're always short of people

00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:39,429
for both teams we hope but I wouldn't

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,790
say that we we know we would always be

00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:45,220
happy to have more people help in right

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:48,839
for Debian CD we are building massive

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:52,569
sets of images every day and every week

00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,100
the weeklies are continuing the dailies

00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,660
are continuing there are tweaks

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,249
happening all the time whether people

00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,139
notice them it will be nice if people

00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:00,549
notice but equally it's also known

00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,920
people don't notice because it means

00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:07,329
they haven't broken yet

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:10,089
one of the major bits of progress with

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:12,569
the that I've made in the last few

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:15,309
months is that we now we're now building

00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:18,600
the officially released Debian live

00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:22,839
images that are shipped from CD image or

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:27,249
unbuilding okay Jerry seems seemed quite

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:30,850
shocked Daniel does some really good

00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:32,529
work on Debian live but his schedule and

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,980
ours don't necessarily always match up

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,829
that well when we come to do releases

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,420
one of the things that we'd like to do

00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:42,100
to be able to make sure that we have

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,809
timely releases and everything is done

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,869
together and hopefully all tested

00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:49,119
together it was to move over to actually

00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:50,860
get Patterson our normal CD build

00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:53,290
machine to also build the live images

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,499
that's basically working for release

00:16:53,290 --> 00:17:00,240
images so far the last couple of

00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:00,240
releases have been built and so on by me

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:07,409
so plans for the future we need to work

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,389
out exactly what image choices we have

00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:12,730
so far what would we tweaked things

00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:15,250
after the granular a couple of years ago

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,110
so we don't necessarily build all all

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,809
the same images but at the moment we

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:24,309
still build for every architecture we

00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:26,980
build an essence we build a CD ones for

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,630
every desktop that we call the claimers

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:34,270
as a first-class citizen so that's

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:36,039
currently gnome KDE LXDE xfce the Marte

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,350
people mate I don't know how it's meant

00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:40,539
to be pronounced I'm sure would love to

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,470
join in I'm sure the other desktop

00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:44,450
people would love to join us

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,190
it's just a case of frankly tell us what

00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:51,580
you need to tell us and make sure it's

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:54,740
all done in task so the tasks old

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,810
desktop qualification thing it's also a

00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,670
way for other desktop environments to

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,160
get added and to get reviewed here's a

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:03,170
process to get a manager as soon as a

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,720
desktop is it ready in task cell and we

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:08,570
think that it actually gives us a

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,150
sensible Debian installation um tell us

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:14,360
let me know and we can we can add it to

00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:16,160
the set of CDs it's not trivial

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,330
nothing's trivial let's be honest but

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,650
it's not hard one of the things that

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,940
I've been tweaking over the last few

00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:28,430
weeks is the choices of CDs for a while

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,150
stupid but it was my fault I will hold

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:34,070
my hand up the gnome CD that was

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:39,530
officially labeled a gnome CD installed

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:40,820
xfce we had a few book reports but I

00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,400
never actually got around to looking at

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:47,540
it and then there's old dull my fault

00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:51,020
that's fixed we still have a lot of CDs

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:54,470
produced the exact choice of what to do

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:57,320
is still open if we want to essentially

00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:00,110
give up on the full sets of CDs that we

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,610
produce I could be persuaded DVDs are

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,470
much more useful at the moment we do

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,690
blue ways we could do we do dual layer

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,550
blue ways not everybody uses them but

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,780
people still seem to ask for them yeah

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:14,510
Joey pass the mic back what's the status

00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:20,210
currently about forcing desktops into

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:22,580
fitting into one CD it doesn't work

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:25,730
the issue with fitting the models onto

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:30,200
one CD is that basically the bigger

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:32,480
desktops don't xfce and lxd a half for a

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,150
long time so they're easy it's one of

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,580
the reasons why we suggested xfce is a

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,350
default desktop for awhile I think this

00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,200
is partly a messaging thing you want

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,790
people if they are if they are limited

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,500
if they're constrained by needing it on

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,510
one CD they need a way to find that out

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,220
because it involve downloading you know

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,550
burning it to CD and then taking it

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,080
somewhere where they need the CD

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,060
Network and finding out that it doesn't

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,660
work economic we need better messaging

00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,280
around it basically it's hard the

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,640
desktops get more more features all the

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,320
time even a minimal gnome or KDE desktop

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,330
really just has too much to fit on the

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,390
single CD have you thought about just

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,160
not building on CDs at all devoting them

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,890
that's a very good question

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,930
I don't know again you know yeah or

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,810
something well yeah yeah quite possibly

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:22,170
yeah I mean at the moment if we've

00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:26,700
already we used to have a multi arch DVD

00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:28,740
wall which had a 386 AMD 64 PowerPC and

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,410
source and that would install all the

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,780
best tops that's already too big so we

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,400
dropped PowerPC I'm not sure at the

00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,770
moment whether or not actually all the

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,100
desktops fit even for AMD 64 nine three

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,840
eight six on a single DVD it's a wow we

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,990
have so much software it's awesome well

00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,360
guys comin up squashy a bit more well

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,460
then I would suggest dropping the the I

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,500
mean if it if gnome doesn't fit on one

00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,540
CD we should just pick they are precise

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,030
on which something reasonable fits if

00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:59,070
that's one gigabyte yeah USB that you

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,690
can burn on DVD or whatever exactly if

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,760
it doesn't fit on CD one just let's not

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:06,960
do it at all sure that's something we

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,490
can absolutely do and then we what one

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,320
thing we've discussed in the past and

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,950
this happened already is DVD one is

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,660
explicitly sized to fit a few bytes on

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,540
to four gigabytes deliberately to make

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,180
sure the DVD one you can just DD to a

00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,710
USB stick that's four gig or write it to

00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:26,220
a DVD and you're not wasting too much

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,870
space we can do one gig to Gig four gig

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,370
eight gig versions of everything but

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,180
that's just a waste of more space let's

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:36,540
be honest an exact spec spec or an exact

00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,160
choice as given by the guys who wanted

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,230
by their own people the KT people

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,350
whatever we can tweak this as much as we

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:45,630
need anyway uh I have William digressing

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,030
so I was just going to suggest I wonder

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,370
if we could get Popkin or similar

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:53,790
uploading a notice of did you install

00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,300
the cd/dvd/usb could we actually get

00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,340
real

00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,550
data here and we have considered that in

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:02,340
the past to be honest um yes we can

00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:04,290
please contribute code sure the one

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,150
detriment of that one is people who are

00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:09,180
highly disconnected are the people least

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,100
likely to upload PubCon show more days

00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,560
some data is better than on obviously

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,960
will have to take up a pinch of salt so

00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,400
moving on Wow I am taking a long time of

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,880
this and I want you guys to be talking

00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,040
not just me Debian CD v4 is I've been

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,980
hacking on for a while

00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,260
Debian CD 3 is what was currently in use

00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,760
one thing that many people have

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,470
complained about over the years was

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,680
never affected me so it's wise never

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:37,170
happened yet is they want to be able to

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,710
build Debian CD without having to have a

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:43,230
full mirror it is a major pain in the

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,820
ass I understand all the machines I want

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,940
have a four-member why doesn't yours but

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,610
I know it's easier said than done I'm

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,090
working on I have a branch that's

00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:57,660
already public its way it's far from

00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:59,820
complete which adds HTTP support so it

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,190
will actually go and if you it will

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,310
build basically enough of a local mirror

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,750
on the fly just pulling everything that

00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,810
it needs it's never going to be as

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:15,260
efficient as it might be but it's better

00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:17,880
than nothing Franklin um yeah for

00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,100
approximately ten years now I wrote a

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,680
script but basically does exactly that

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,600
as a wrapper around WN CD and it goes

00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,210
and fetches installer images called

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,130
simple zdd I'm really excited to hear

00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:32,220
that might get that kind of support

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,660
integrated into Debian CD shop it's

00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,610
coming in something I've been hacking on

00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,130
for six months and I know I've not made

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:41,370
much noise about it it's hard it really

00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:43,230
is though not because it's really we

00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,420
know computer science hard it's just

00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,770
there are so many places in Debian CD

00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,870
where we've made assumptions over the

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,180
years of I need to know what files to

00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,070
put in I can just do an LS locally I've

00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,260
now got to go in grab grab remote

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,780
directory listings over HTTP and hope it

00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:01,100
works it's a mess we'll get there

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,660
so man yeah there's a lot of bug fixes

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,410
please report bugs if you're actually a

00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,110
user of Debian CDI no the wall

00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:11,170
I actually the more bugs we get the more

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:14,950
chances we're going to fix them I want

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:16,990
to get regular live builds testing so

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,440
again so we can get some weekly builds

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:22,750
out this hasn't happened yet it's coming

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,340
again in my coppice free time if people

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,480
want to join in and help with this kind

00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:30,300
of thing that will be awesome

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,710
it takes time another one that came up

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,570
when I started looking at the live

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,580
builds and I realized actually the only

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:39,640
sane way of doing this is building in

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,130
the VM for whole slow slew of reasons

00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,780
basically you need to have root to make

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,720
a live image because you've got to make

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:50,140
device nodes the only sane way of doing

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,600
that on a system that DSA are involved

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:57,670
in is you do it in a VM or it doesn't

00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:59,950
happen I understand it it's hard once

00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,830
I've got a VM going and this is the

00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:06,730
system I've set up for the live builds

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:09,220
we can do cloud images we can do images

00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:13,090
instead of necessarily installer images

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:15,250
safer embedded architectures one thing I

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:19,270
know Neil Williams has been playing with

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,650
quite a lot in lava for testing he's

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,620
gonna be talking about that later in the

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:26,170
week is actually having images that you

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,330
can test on arm and a hole on whatever

00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,430
other architectures you want running

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,710
that and building those on the fly as

00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:35,110
you go with di can be caught it can be

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,210
quite tough there's nothing stopping

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,740
those generating regular images which

00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,950
you can literally just download and

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,890
stick a DDL to an SD card or or whatever

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,240
and run it's something that nobody's

00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,890
ever actually got to and I'm quite

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,420
surprised we don't have these yet

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:54,490
well I can do them just give me time and

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:58,030
the last thing here I've got a kernel

00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:00,370
patch to rewrite this week I spoke to

00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:04,930
case who came up there's a there's a

00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:06,850
minor issue we have with CD builds the

00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,640
way the Debian CD works is it creates a

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:13,030
tree of hot links as it runs and then

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,130
makes images from those on systems were

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,260
you're not running as the same user

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,360
the person who owns the mirror like for

00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,250
example Pettersen or build machine this

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,010
falls over in a heap because this is

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,960
dodgy behavior I've got a kernel patch

00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:29,260
or I had one and then I lost it because

00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:33,700
I over wrote that VM by doing an install

00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:35,170
a test and realized afterwards ah again

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,780
I'm sure we've all we've done that kind

00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:39,370
of thing I'm hoping to find time this

00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:43,660
week till we do that kernel patch I

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:46,600
spoke to him he's happy to review it so

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:50,710
discussion I hope we still have a bit of

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,990
time left what else people want to see

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,250
what else do people want to talk about

00:26:51,990 --> 00:27:05,080
I've already been authorized half an

00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:06,460
hour here please tell me okay so one of

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,880
the things that's kind of been brought

00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,640
up on the Debian arm list was what arm

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,740
platforms can we support it's basically

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,690
based on a bunch of kernels do we

00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,160
install you boot or do we use the

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,750
onboard you boots and all that kind of

00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,870
stuff I'd be really interested in

00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,120
working towards that or or at least like

00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,400
focusing on open or fairly open

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,680
platforms and just you know moving in

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,110
that direction I mean that's thankfully

00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,360
now we've got the common p kernel and

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,790
device between everything yes most

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,320
kernel we can at least actually possibly

00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:43,360
sensibly get to the point where we could

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:46,330
run the installer directly exactly now

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,250
we have a we we we've never had for

00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,290
example in Debian CD we've never had

00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,700
bootable arm stuff because every

00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:53,980
platform was so different it was

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,690
ludicrous we're actually not far off the

00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,390
point what we might be able to actually

00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,010
have real bootable stuff that is

00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,900
available straight off the CD or

00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,110
straight off the USB stick or the SD

00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:07,600
card or whatever

00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:09,370
yes definitely let's let's do that

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,430
I learned they'll posted loads of stuff

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:15,340
and in and fragrant does anybody else

00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:17,110
interested in helping with that I think

00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,310
it's like you just and I think I don't

00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,399
know if we're quite at the point it on

00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:22,129
the CD or definitely

00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:23,749
we're di and make images that can boot

00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:25,999
on these boards quite easily with device

00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:32,809
tree we have that food image or

00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:35,179
something like that and yeah I mean the

00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:38,119
I'm sixty-four of course is going to be

00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:40,070
mostly UEFI is what varies people like

00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:41,570
Alma saying but then a whole lot of

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:51,519
people have already for ships some ship

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:51,519
various versions of you boot it's really

00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:58,999
cool of a fitment does have UEFI he does

00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:01,999
yes so anyway yes so I was wondering

00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:04,820
with the proliferation of sizes for all

00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:08,059
the we need a 500 mega image a one Giga

00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,580
to give data 48 we're pretty much all

00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:13,339
capable of running cat and the vast

00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,320
majority of bigger images are just for

00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:16,969
you dense and more Deb's yet that we

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,879
just create a set of concatenate able

00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:22,159
images where if you want a two gig image

00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:23,749
you concatenate the 500 Meg the one gig

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,269
of the 2gig image and throw them on a

00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:29,029
disk and then you don't need to store

00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:40,219
the 500g many data ten times over for 10

00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:41,779
different images idea baseline of cat

00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:44,960
these three images and right into a

00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:46,549
guess that's sound like I could make

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,960
like an absolutely awesome idea well

00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:51,160
fortunately file systems don't work that

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:55,630
way we could fix that

00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,250
I using the Biosystems one of the one of

00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,910
the things I've had I've had a book

00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:03,580
about for ages is is to actually to do

00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:07,300
something similar which given the set of

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,310
CDs or DVDs basically turn that into an

00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,200
into a mirror that works so I've had

00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,180
people in the past who bought a set full

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,310
Center DVDs for we live in architecture

00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,080
I've got those and they're saying why I

00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,070
want to share this one entire company

00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:24,250
what do I do next

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:27,670
it's harder than it should be and it's

00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:29,950
quite related as again somebody asked I

00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,140
forget what I asked a couple years ago

00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,600
could we do exactly that could we take a

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:39,790
sensor DVDs and make a 16gb USB stick

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:41,710
image cat is going to be too simple it's

00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,600
a big amount of our system at work oh

00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:47,140
absolutely yes it should be entirely

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,900
feasible to come up with a script that

00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:52,630
will make an image form a smaller set of

00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,550
images absolutely that's essentially

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,860
what that means easy does it converts

00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:59,110
the big image which is the archive into

00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,610
a smaller sensors into a smaller set of

00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,610
images that just happen to work together

00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:08,770
putting smaller images back together and

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:11,620
making it work is entirely feasible it's

00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:13,480
something that I want to do I might get

00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,890
to in five years if you have ideas and

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,890
if you want to help please stop it

00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:23,070
I filed a wishlist book that was similar

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,549
at one point which was I want to make a

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:28,499
multi-artist CD that is mostly amd64 but

00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:33,659
has those other thing you know smaller

00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:37,649
versions of the yes yes WC these are the

00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:39,659
multi arch happened quite differently to

00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:42,360
the archive idea with multi arch other

00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:45,269
people aware of this so we have a multi

00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,850
op CD and DVD set at the moment which

00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:50,190
are basically we make sure that for any

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,019
given package we install it for every

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:57,210
architecture that is desired on the CD

00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:59,490
or DVD that the the naming clash is

00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,049
unfortunate but to be honest it's the it

00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:04,379
is the obvious names that have to

00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:07,139
describe it it would be nice absolutely

00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:09,240
to have a have all options in terms of

00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:12,869
choosing which which subsets you want

00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,419
for different architectures it's it's

00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:18,809
back to accounting please die then I

00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:21,350
would love to help and again I was in

00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:21,350
the day at all

00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:30,320
just on the subject of cloud images and

00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,330
MMC images so di well actually a lot of

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,400
interesting and useful questions as you

00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,690
go about key maps and mirrors yeah these

00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,270
sorts of things and the problem with

00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,049
images is that they don't you have to go

00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,370
as you mess around

00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:44,330
tweaking all that stuff which is a real

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,559
pain yes Jeffrey whiteford di so it's

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,909
literally gonna serve you will need

00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:49,309
somebody would need to go out and write

00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:53,510
some sort of first food configuration

00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:55,460
utility that we think we've had these

00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,320
evenings Lloyd but of course yeah the

00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,940
problem is that still the person using

00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,600
it for the first time doesn't get asked

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,880
the questions if we can actually have we

00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,130
should be able hopefully to be further

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,960
into the installer until yeah yeah yeah

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,110
yeah we purpose bits you have different

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,830
things and actually that's making all

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:17,809
this all sort of exists yeah I mean that

00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:23,510
would be a cool thing to do

00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:26,120
cool I just want to say that the cloud

00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:28,640
people that already got something called

00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:32,630
cloud in it was so that's true yeah

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,159
exactly Thomas action and I've had the

00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,740
discussion a few weeks ago where he

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,210
asked well shirley's you know come

00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,029
somebody else do this on official

00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,169
servers and push it and whatever

00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:43,909
absolutely we could build them we can

00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:46,760
host them on CD image alongside all of

00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:48,890
these CD images Ovid is not a wonderful

00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,020
name for these central server that we

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,690
have we know this we agreed this five

00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,250
years ago you know it's just install the

00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,840
doctor that we know or whatever would be

00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:01,390
better it's just that

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:04,390
hey names stick around in a while so

00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,390
definitely

00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:12,860
at some point we would love to have a

00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,300
heavily possible type of image to

00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,070
install that mean whether it's in it

00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,350
whether it's just an image EDD to a desk

00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,060
whether it's an installer which asks you

00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,340
a whole lot of questions and partitions

00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,870
and everything all of those are possible

00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,380
and we should be working to get them

00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:32,710
together again it's a these are all cool

00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,710
ideas please help so another cool idea

00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:37,310
just bought several please somebody tell

00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:46,820
me that they're putting these down in

00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:50,240
Bobby so we have notes what's the status

00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:53,570
of like signed images both within the

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,840
image itself and signing the actual

00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:59,150
image I don't how do you mean well I

00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,190
mean you've got a bunch of checksums and

00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:04,280
so yeah but do you have like jpg signed

00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:06,140
images at the archive keys like how much

00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,570
would it take to make that happen if not

00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,520
what we have us okay so all of the

00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:13,520
images that we ship all the official

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,350
ones the weeklies Oh Cody signed with

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,150
the temporary key and so as a dailies to

00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,160
be able with that something we've got to

00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,870
do something quite recently I resisted

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,880
it for quite a while because it's it's

00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:25,280
it's essentially meaningless it's a key

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,840
though you know it means nothing well

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,090
suppose that some people like it means

00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:34,030
at least they've got some indication

00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:37,550
that it's not been run in the middle I

00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:40,310
have I have cross signs every key that

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:43,670
we use with my own personal key I've

00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:45,470
only official CD release keys I've had a

00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,690
few of the other people around who I can

00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,520
press go and have signed it so we've had

00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,290
to say a couple of release managers and

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,390
various people in the UK because help

00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:57,710
they happen to be nearby have signed

00:35:53,390 --> 00:36:00,080
this the normalcdf signing key we don't

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:02,030
yet do well overall it basically because

00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,660
it's faff and I haven't got that far it

00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:07,480
will happen at some point

00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:10,090
in terms of so all of the things

00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,190
assigned we do get occasional people

00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,880
saying why are why isn't everything over

00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:18,430
HTTPS and well we're about to get though

00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,140
I guess well the problem is the CDs are

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,040
so big that we want people getting them

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,050
from their words we don't necessarily

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,930
want they'll get old gassing them all

00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:28,810
from the same central site and signing

00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:31,420
gets no signing in HTTP and whatever

00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:34,120
gets harder then just an anything that

00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:37,360
at least the DI is silenced

00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:39,100
we 32 loader checks that downloads the

00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,350
signature and all that and yes you can

00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,850
then you can download the Devon insulin

00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:46,420
net food images that are also in their

00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:49,510
archive yes the fun thing about actually

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,700
having archived signatures on say to

00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,470
release files and whatever inside the

00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,100
CDs and again this is a discussion

00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:59,740
that's come up several times is it

00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:02,050
actually gives you nothing if anything

00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:05,560
is worse than nothing the problem by

00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:07,120
having the signatures on the CDs is that

00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,550
for a lot of people that means there

00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,710
will then implicitly trust them if

00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,970
you've been given a CD that has

00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,680
something that claims to have been

00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,260
signed

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,640
what is your trust path you have no way

00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,440
of knowing that except that it came

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,120
through yes I know if you've downloaded

00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,350
a signed image and then it has the

00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,830
archive inside anyway

00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:31,500
it's it's a whole problem there isn't a

00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:35,260
solution kinda just sit with the HTTPS

00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:37,060
if you if you start using HTTPS a lot

00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,350
but large piles you get into really big

00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,610
problems if people are trying to use

00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:43,680
squid proxies and things like that

00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:47,410
because they're personal are we having a

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,540
problem sec mappers davy build test

00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:51,260
images which for the same reasons yeah

00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,570
it can be a real pain

00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:58,660
you actually got everything ends up on

00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:58,660
hasted yes with no fall back sure

00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:08,660
I was just wondering if we had any idea

00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:11,359
what the status of the eye on our new

00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:14,780
architectures was a PC alarms expose

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,280
anyone actually tried it probably no

00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,400
stop out to port when I've been building

00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:24,079
on 64 do images from Debian ports for a

00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,549
while yeah installs but then there's no

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,920
store flash code while I did it in his

00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:29,299
nvm and in Clearview but there's no

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,510
bootloader in either of those so I had

00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:33,589
nothing disagree with I've just last

00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,720
night switched over to using the

00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:38,000
official archive and there isn't enough

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,190
bits in it yet sure if he's been

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,530
pestering all the daily basis and given

00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:45,640
an army only thing the build shows to go

00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:49,460
to list of the I pushed keyboard chooser

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,260
yesterday with patches for on 64 PPC 64

00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:55,040
yell so so we have all the paths but

00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:58,010
possibly not kernels that actually I'm

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,299
sure will okay okay do we and we think

00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,640
it works on the hub where available

00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:04,099
yeah you should do the nice thing with

00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,500
width on 64 is is it should just work

00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:07,369
with device tree but I was just

00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,910
wondering whether than were taught

00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:12,829
degree here let's Detroit in its arm HF

00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,119
and biopsies before as well as producing

00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:15,319
you the Installer bridges which is the

00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,960
directory full of all the device trees

00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:19,640
at that kernel came with yeah if you can

00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,710
decode the names of those files into the

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,210
no character you've got where's

00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,119
everything they don't maybe time for one

00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:31,369
more question

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:33,500
yeah is for you out that the batches of

00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:36,140
what we're done by the canonical phones

00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,450
yes so we are using on you doing - and

00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,980
it seems freaking on for now so we have

00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,799
an internal you might Chinese public

00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:46,099
knob for Devon and it's able to stall

00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:48,950
over a TM and over what we call very

00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:52,099
mantle yeah so he's working pretty fine

00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,450
okay oh so fingers crossed we should

00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,069
have the new architecture just

00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:57,170
integrated as a matter of course for

00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:59,329
Jesse assuming that they all build by

00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,970
then and of course if you've got stuff

00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:03,200
as I said earlier especially di stuff

00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,690
that does not build for the new

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,830
architectures fix it or you will be in a

00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:11,760
mood in the next two

00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:13,900
so please help or we'll work around you

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,300
and I think that's probably a good time

00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,730
to leave it upon to say please help

00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,930
that'd be an install the Debian CD we

00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,120
really need your help there's always

00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,500
more stuff to do as you as you can see

00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,690
here just the discussion we've had

00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,610
there's more cool things that we all

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,710
we've been wanting to do for years

00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,180
well oh Christ look like the two of us

00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,960
we're not going to get there please join

00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,960
