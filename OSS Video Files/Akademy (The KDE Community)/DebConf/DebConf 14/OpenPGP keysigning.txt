ooh party people this is the deb Kampf

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:13,679
14 open PGP key signing party so I I'm

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,730
DK G this is an eyeball I want to

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,890
welcome everybody here we're gonna be

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,869
passing around two decks of cards

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,320
they're gonna each deck needs to go

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,640
across the entire room you'll get you'll

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,710
get a deck coming in a different

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,840
direction make sure you get the top blue

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,310
card that when the deck hits you and the

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,890
top red card when the decades here I'll

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,000
explain what's going on with that later

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,500
just make sure that you pass it so that

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,860
everybody manages to get one of each

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:45,600
card I'm not gonna tell you it's okay if

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,370
people know what your card is you don't

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,260
have to hide the card and I'm not going

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,260
to do any sort of magic tricks guessing

00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:10,200
so okay so we're gonna start with a

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,229
little overview about what we're doing

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,880
here and why we're doing it and then a

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,030
little bit of technical detail and then

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,060
we'll go ahead with the actual program

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:25,650
so yes we are going to do the hash at

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,820
some point so so I recognize that there

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,799
are some people who are here who have

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,540
done consigning parties many many times

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,070
before and I suspect that there are some

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,549
people here who have never done a key

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,220
signing party ever so so there's going

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,770
to be some explanation and it's I want

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,479
to encourage people to ask questions if

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,130
you're not sure why something is useful

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,960
or why someone something might might

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,790
happen I don't think we have time to go

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,000
into all of the possibilities about what

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:57,840
could be done or specific tools to use

00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,040
for every single thing but question yes

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
I will speak more slowly

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,790
we also have a microphone we have a

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,929
microphone for the people with questions

00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:13,330
in the audience I think and Anibal has

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,240
it so if you if you want to ask a

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,980
question please raise your hand and wait

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:25,300
until you get the microphone to ask the

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:28,930
question why are we taking a card in

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:33,750
passing the rest down we'll get to that

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:37,900
I promise okay

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:41,230
so so primarily what we're trying to do

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,810
here is to meet each other and to

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,040
establish connections with each other so

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,650
that we can continue to have those

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,130
connections in a secure fashion over the

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,040
Internet

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,930
in the future we're establishing the

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,209
identity of other people who work on the

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,360
project getting to know who they are and

00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,760
making sure that we have a way a secure

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,050
way that we can communicate offline so

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,209
we're bootstrapping the offline

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,070
communication from this I'm the online

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,019
communication from this offline Meetup

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:13,540
so that's the purpose of a key signing

00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:17,140
party so many of the people who are here

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,150
probably sent an email to an e ball with

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,590
their key and asked for it to be

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,799
included in the key signing party and

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,239
that's great if you did that with the

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:31,810
public part of your key yes not the

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:34,330
private part so I'm sure that there are

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,310
several people here if not many people

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,670
here who did not get an email to any

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,780
ball and that's also okay so there are

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,760
some things that are going to be more

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,000
convenient for the people who have sent

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,530
their key to an e ball earlier but if

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,600
you did not bring if you did not do that

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,250
you can still participate it'll just be

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,250
a little bit less convenient for you so

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,470
so yeah sorry there are there are four

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,870
people who came in late there are two

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,519
decks of cards going around a blue deck

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,709
and a red deck and everyone should get

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,390
the top card from each deck when it

00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:11,320
passes so make sure you have a blue card

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:13,750
and a red card we'll get to that so so

00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,530
part of meeting people is knowing who

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,209
people are

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,440
there are some open seats up here if the

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,530
lurkers in the back when it comes it

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,060
down but part of it is the the

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,000
cryptographic part is that we want to

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,370
verify people's fingerprints so the

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,550
fingerprint is a marker for your public

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,350
key it is very difficult to forge a

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,860
fingerprint that matches your

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:40,300
fingerprint and normally if you're doing

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:42,940
pairwise fingerprint verification then

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,400
both parties have to read to each other

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,470
a relatively long string of hexadecimal

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,210
characters and verify that from the

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,490
other person that's kind of a boring

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,870
task we're also not very good at it as

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,860
humans so the sending the keys earlier

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,780
we're going to we're going to avoid

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,600
having to do that many pairwise

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,790
fingerprint matches by as a group we're

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,350
going to take a list of all of the

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,610
fingerprints that everybody has

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,290
submitted and we're going to

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,660
collectively verify that we all got that

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,370
same list and that way when you meet

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,250
someone whose key was on that list

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,710
you'll be able to go you'll be able to

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,919
say to that person oh I had the same

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,500
fingerprint hash that you did when I

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:28,060
when we looked at the big list and Mikey

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,650
was number 28 and then you can look at

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,270
the list and you say oh it's number 28

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,860
and now you've got the file

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,990
you've got the fingerprint you can just

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,060
work with that so it's the advantage is

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,039
that everybody verifies one big

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,010
fingerprint and then we can work with

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,539
the tool with with our tools to do the

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,190
signing afterwards does that make sense

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:48,669
as to why the process is set up that way

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,350
if you did not so right so the steps I

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,200
have here is everyone has the the big

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,930
list and if you don't have it yet you

00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,530
can fetch it from there which may or may

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,450
not be men in the middle and then we're

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:05,370
going to take a digest of the of the big

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,370
list and then we're going

00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:27,690
so we'll compare the digest and the

00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:34,770
other thing no no not those they've run

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:37,080
out of red cards Wow all right really

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,400
how many people do well no cuz this is

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,949
gonna that's gonna put everybody in the

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:46,530
same in the same boat here alright so if

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:48,419
you if you didn't get a card then then

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,630
then you look at your neighbor to your

00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,620
left and note their red card and look at

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,360
your neighbor to your right and note

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,360
their blue card and that's yours

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,539
sorry initially when everyone was here

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,220
at the start of the talk there were less

00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,690
than 80 people in the room and now there

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,910
are more than 80 people in the room and

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,380
I apologized that I that I didn't expect

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,030
so many people to come in after the talk

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,680
started if you came in after the talk

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,500
started you're going to get you're going

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,289
to choose randomly about the cards later

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:33,910
okay sorry it doesn't work to give out

00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:37,030
these cards now not if you don't have a

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,310
card so the critical thing here is that

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,930
when you look at this list it's not just

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:45,699
about having the group consensus about

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:48,520
what the digest is on that list you also

00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:51,220
have to verify that your fingerprint on

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,860
that list is your fingerprint so if we

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,810
all agreed on the collective digest but

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,160
your fingerprint has changed I think

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,610
what was the one who made the list and

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,130
then it got transmitted over a clear

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,159
text HTTP make sure that your

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,470
fingerprint is the right one if you're

00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:10,360
not in the list and I'm sure many people

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,340
aren't make sure you've got copies

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,630
physical copies of your fingerprint when

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,039
we're doing these key signings you're

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,229
not going to be reading your full

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,090
fingerprint to all of your neighbors so

00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:20,620
if you have a physical copy that you can

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,509
hand to your neighbor when you're in the

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,979
process of doing the verification that

00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,259
way they've got a copy of it and they

00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:27,490
can do whatever they want with it

00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,039
so I want to emphasize here the

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,200
fingerprints are for crypto the goal of

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,849
all of this is to meet other people in

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,800
Debian so that you can keep in touch

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:48,190
with them and do stuff with them later

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:49,779
work on projects so so so do the people

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,540
who are put so you can also participate

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,399
without verifying the the fingerprint of

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,690
the of the file and you're just not

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,600
going to be able to correctly verify

00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,920
people's fingerprints so in which case

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,160
you probably should not be signing their

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,160
keys

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,820
you can verify the individual

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,380
fingerprint but your I don't want people

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,700
to have to be doing that during the

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:18,510
group keys on there so sorry you want

00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:21,270
the URL there there you go

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:25,660
so that's Devi

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,830
KSP key signing party DEFCON 14 so KSP

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:32,590
DC 14

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:43,270
oh there's way more opportunities than

00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:45,310
two so so so I want to make sure that

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,260
every so I want I want to get around to

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,440
just we're going to get out of the way

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:54,550
the group verification of the of the

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,900
fingerprint of the whole file and so I

00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,550
want to make sure that everyone who is

00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,510
going to be verifying the fingerprint of

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:04,420
the whole file is prepared to do that

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,220
so is if anyone who is planning on

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,470
verifying this and is not prepared to

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:14,200
verify the fingerprint please raise your

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:19,420
hand okay so if you have the fingerprint

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,730
front of you raise your hand okay so

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,070
another option for some people if you

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,360
want is to make a note of the finger if

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,350
you don't have it if you're not one of

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,660
the folks who have it in front of you

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,580
you can write down the fingerprint that

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,250
we are all going to consents on shortly

00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,750
and then you can later fetch the file

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:44,410
and try to verify the fingerprint that

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:50,420
way so yes you'll need to have an exact

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:59,929
copy of the file it is now

00:10:50,420 --> 00:11:02,699
so sure the URL is devily /k spdc 1 for

00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:06,779
that was a random URL string that it

00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:09,649
gave me from the URL shortener but I was

00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,649
using dual EC drbg

00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:29,519
sorry okay so so I've just put the

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:31,559
finger the sha-256 some of the of the

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:37,790
key signing party lists up there and I'm

00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:47,489
going to read it out loud so it is for

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:53,269

Bravo 5 alpha Foxtrot 9 1 charlie does

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,660
anyone have a different fingerprint

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:45,960
no I am NOT I'm only going to read out

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:47,580
the the this one file this is the

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,320
canonical file I don't think we should

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:57,360
have separate versions that are multiple

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:59,130
not quite canonical files so so there

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,200
there's there's some discussion here

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,880
about what for people who are listening

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
remotely and don't have the microphone

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,940
access there's discussion about whether

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,160
we're going to verify another files

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,000
fingerprint and I want to minimize the

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,580
amount of fingerprint verification

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,620
because that's not the point here the

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,970
fingerprint verification the goal is to

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,620
make sure we have a cryptographic link

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,330
this is sufficient to have this

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:24,930
cryptographic link and I don't think we

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:28,580
should do more the question is is anyone

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,580
going to use the condensed file

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,300
so there's some discussion about which

00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:51,290
files are acceptable to use that the

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,450
canonical version is this KS PDC 14 text

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,810
not the compressed one Berlin did you

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,760
want to repeat that so the issue I'm

00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,780
pointing out is that at the very least I

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,490
remember off the top of my head the

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,190
condensed file does not list the key

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,710
lengths of the of the of the keys so

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:09,020
verifying that checksum doesn't give you

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,900
the same cryptographic assurance and

00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,910
should not be used and also I'm not

00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,470
checking that file so you'll just have

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:21,500
to use the real one can your hand stand

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:23,090
like so okay this is speaking with I was

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,730
one of the reviewers for the latest

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:29,140
round of the open PGP spec when it was

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:31,430
approved it is my understanding that a

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,710
modern key and I'd have to go back and

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,180
look this up we got to a point where you

00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,490
all you needed was the fingerprints I

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,740
believe that's correct

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:43,640
but it is absolutely true for DSA keys

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:46,300
and especially for PGP one keys that is

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,730
not true yeah

00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:58,610
DGP v3 keys do not have the fingerprint

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:59,930
does nothing because the length why I'm

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,670
not I don't want to get into the

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,320
cryptographic details right now I want

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,060
to get on with with meeting each other

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,580
because I think that's the point also I

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,770
am NOT verifying any fingerprints that

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,390
are mine except in that file so if you

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,400
were trying to verify some other file I

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,410
am NOT assuring you that your copy of my

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,600
fingerprint is valid you must verify

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:22,460
that fingerprint to be assured that my

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,380
fingerprint is valid okay so a couple of

00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,440
points here no one is under any

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,970
obligation to sign any key right you

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,350
don't have to sign every key of every

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,110
person that you meet at this key signing

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,580
party even if you say that you do the

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,110
even if you say that you plan to and if

00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,490
someone decides to not sign your key or

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,190
if someone is lazy and forgets about it

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,780
you can ping them if you want but it's

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,150
okay if they don't want to sign your key

00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,400
you know we would be happy to have

00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,800
people meet each other and certify each

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,720
other's identities but it's okay if

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,630
that's not what if somebody doesn't want

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,110
to sign so traditionally with key

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,690
signing parties

00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,829
people have asked - you know we asked

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,579
people to bring some form of

00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:04,890
identification so what kind of ID is

00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,600
okay I want to point out that the bottom

00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,649
point here is the critical part which is

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,750
that different people have different

00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:11,190
standards at Debbie and we really want

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,620
to make sure that we know who each other

00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:15,990
is but there are some people here whose

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,110
government-issued IDs don't match their

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,839
actual identities depending on what you

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,910
considered to be actual some people here

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,980
have identities have identity papers

00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,329
that are not international that not

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,329
internationally valid like a local

00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:32,760
driver's license some people have just

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:34,350
this as their identity and it's up to

00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,870
the person who's doing the certification

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,600
to decide what kind of ID is sufficient

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,519
and how many IDs they need to get so I

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,079
just wanted to point that out and this

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,649
is again up to the person who's doing

00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:48,510
the certifying and one more point here

00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:50,430
for folks who have not participated in a

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,680
key signing party before we are not

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:56,010
actually signing Keys at the key signing

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,170
party we are taking notes and you will

00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,579
use those notes later to certify

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,260
whichever keys you decide you want to

00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:03,029
but we are not going to do any key

00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,350
certification in this room I mean maybe

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,839
some people will because they're crazy

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,760
but the point here is to not actually do

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,650
the key certifying right now make notes

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,910
so that you know what the keys are that

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,169
you are going to certify and then you

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,730
can go do that whenever you want and

00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:16,890
different people take notes in different

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,569
ways one of the reasons to argue for

00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,579
printing out the sheet is that it's easy

00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:22,620
to take notes on the sheet with a pen

00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,910
and when you meet someone face to face

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,350
it's nice to have a piece of paper and a

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,240
pen it doesn't feel quite as alienating

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,340
as a computer other people prefer to

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,690
take notes on the computer they can they

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,790
can process them more easily that way

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:39,270
and you know different people have

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:41,580
different note-taking styles so so the

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:44,940
way that we're going to I'm just going

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,970
to demonstrate with an eval the way that

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,040
we would use the way that we would do

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,360
this because people who are here have

00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,360
not done this product process before

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,940
so

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:14,720
okay so I'm gonna say I'm Daniel Kahn

00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,820
Gilmore

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,530
my email address is DK g @ v Rosamond

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:23,960
net and i have verified the fingerprint

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,670
that we all agreed on here and i have

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,170
checked the file and my fingerprint is

00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:31,550
correct in there and i am number 28 so I

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:36,290
would say this to any ball and he would

00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:39,040
look at his notes and check I did check

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:43,630
the hash of the file and here's my ID

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,630
it's a New York state driver's license I

00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:54,820
also have this which doesn't have my

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:57,710
middle name on it and I have I have my

00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,880
health care card and I probably had

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,820
something that I wrote in crayons and

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,650
where else so now it's up to him to

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:11,300
decide whether or not he thinks that is

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:13,630
a sufficient identification my number is

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,630
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:34,379
am I going to check his name 28 fingers

00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:36,539
pin you said check then I checked my

00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:39,509
fingerprint and I've another file you

00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:42,840
IDs okay yep thank you

00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:54,179
sure so I would like I would like to get

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:56,039
my ID back thank you I did so let me say

00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,909
that again because because Zobel thinks

00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,950
that I didn't say it

00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:00,929
I checked the fingerprint of the file

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,460
and I looked at the file and I checked

00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:06,690
that my fingerprint is correct in the

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,789
file and I am number 28 that was the

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:15,090
first thing that I said yes so there's a

00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:18,269
menage as a hand there would it be

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:21,919
faster to have a go around and say

00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:24,119
things like I'm number 66 I checked the

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,309
signal should check some other file and

00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,109
so the answer is yes it would be faster

00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,239
but people would not be able to verify

00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:32,989
whatever identity documents represent so

00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:35,039
the identity can be then checked

00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:36,629
separately well if you're checking the

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,090
identity separately at that point you

00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:40,950
can also say to the person I checked I'm

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,509
in the file I've checked my fingerprint

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,830
in the file and I'm number eight if

00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,320
you're doing that separately which I

00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,690
encourage you to do after the KSP wait

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,379
okay so this is does this process make

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:54,960
sense to people

00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:58,049
any other questions so we'll get to the

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,080
car it's come oncome folks so after the

00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:04,019
KSP after the KSP you will process your

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,700
notes you're gonna you're gonna certify

00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:08,460
the people's keys who you decided to

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,529
certify I recommend emailing your set

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,029
your signatures to the people because

00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:14,220
that's a way to verify their email

00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:16,080
address right if I said hi my name is

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,169
Daniel Kahn Gilmore my email address is

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,519
president at whitehouse.gov you probably

00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:21,899
don't want to certify that because you

00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,330
can recognize it that's probably not my

00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:26,249
email address but you can't tell really

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,580
with other ones and so if you email your

00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:30,039
signatures to the purse

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,330
who you signed then then you're

00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:36,220
verifying that at least they have some

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:38,019
way to read that email so yes so there's

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,669
a tool called CAF from key signing party

00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:40,919
that automates that and I recommend

00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:42,159
checking it out there's also a tool

00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,350
sorry

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,909
signing party don't don't believe what

00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:51,249
you see up here I'm not going to change

00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:54,549
it and so there's signing party and

00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:56,529
monkey sign and pajas that all offer

00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:57,879
that I recommend cap at the moment I'm

00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:00,039
hoping to recommend monkey sign in the

00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:02,200
future are these slides are these slides

00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:04,859
available online they're not right now

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,859
but I'll put them online

00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:17,080
was there so sorry there's a bunch of

00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:18,429
blastn questions and I'd like to have

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,859
one conversation until we can get the

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,539
vicky center if you receive emails from

00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:24,940
people that are using CAF I think it's

00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:27,429
important to note that that's the

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,429
signature and then you need to upload

00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:32,859
that to the server otherwise it won't be

00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:35,200
public so that email if you want it to

00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:40,239
be email that will be sent via via CAF

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,700
will be a message text with the signed

00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:44,830
key attached all of that encrypted and

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,179
then mailed to you and so when you

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,960
receive it you'll need to decrypt the

00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:51,639
email say extract the attachment import

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,549
that into your PGP key ring using

00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:57,129
probably GPG import or whatever tools

00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:59,139
you have available and then if you want

00:22:57,129 --> 00:23:00,309
that signature to be visible to the rest

00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:05,669
of the world you'll don't need to send

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:08,019
your key to the public key servers Tom

00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:11,980
yeah I just wanted I was trying to find

00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:14,679
a correct book number here and I'm not

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,570
finding it at the moment but I wanted to

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,940
just remind people that there is a

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:23,460
little bit of a confusing configuration

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:26,710
step for CAF it has its own directory

00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,940
for GPG configuration and it's kind of

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,609
important before you actually start

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,499
signing keys to make sure that among

00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:35,019
other things the signature strength is

00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:38,470
set sufficiently high like sha-256 are

00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:40,059
better in that file I'd be glad to

00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,840
answer anyone's questions about how to

00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,039
do that

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,380
if anyone has any questions about that

00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,270
well and also just to follow up on the

00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,970
comte integrity mentioned earlier I

00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:53,260
think it's generally polite to let

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:55,450
people upload their own signatures I I

00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,520
like to be the one that upload my own

00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,610
signatures because often if if you send

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,980
me a sha-1 signed key I will probably

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:05,049
politely ask you to resign it and then

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:11,049
I'll upload your strong signature to the

00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:13,630
key servers thank you these are good

00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:17,710
recommendations so are we ready to learn

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:19,360
what the cards are for okay so everyone

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:27,510
has a red card and a blue card except

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:30,929
for the folks who came in late okay so

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:33,700
when it so the red you're gonna have a

00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:37,570
zero or one red cards and zero or one

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:39,669
blue cards and when I say your red card

00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:43,350
and you don't have a red card you get to

00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:46,059
pick a number from one to ten

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,350
okay so what we're gonna do is we're

00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:49,179
gonna split into groups we're gonna

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,470
split into ten groups and the groups are

00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:52,600
going to be based on the number that you

00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,950
have on the card and when you pick a

00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,240
number you'll just go to the group with

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,590
that number and the groups are good and

00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,700
so the goal here we're going to do to

00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,960
this twice we're gonna do it once with

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,750
the red cards and then once with the

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,630
blue cards and in each group you'll get

00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:07,149
to meet a small handful of other debian

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:09,580
folks and you can within that group

00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:11,649
exchange you can you'll take turns

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,970
introducing yourself to everyone who's

00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:15,899
in the group and sugar and passing

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:19,360
around your ID for them to look at and

00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:22,270
then roll so we're gonna do that for

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,740
about ten minutes and then we're gonna

00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,980
switch and we'll do the blue card groups

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:28,779
and the goal of this is we're not trying

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,210
to get everyone to certify everyone

00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:33,669
else's key the goal is to have a bunch

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,020
of people who have signed we're it's

00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:36,490
going to create sort of a mesh of

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,600
sitting up certifications and it's going

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,669
to give you a better chance to actually

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,409
know something about the person whose

00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:46,779
keys you're signing so in addition to

00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,190
doing this you can also meet any anyone

00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:50,289
during the rest of the conference and

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,480
while you're talking to them say hey I

00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:55,400
missed you at the key signing party but

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,690
and then have the same exchange and

00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,970
actually have a real conversation with a

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:07,370
little bit more time to do so okay so so

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:11,270
we're gonna do ace - I guess let's do a

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:13,270
stew three four five six seven eight

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:16,940
nine ten

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:18,620
doesn't matter no oh sorry

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,090
red card first but we're now it's not

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,380
about whether it's red versus black on

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:27,020
the suit okay right so so look at your

00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,650
card look at your red card and one two

00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,370
three

00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:35,090
oh sorry ace two three four five six

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:38,510
seven eight nine ten and when you're in

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,770
your group your goodness when you're

00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,390
introducing yourself you're going to say

00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,700
your name you're going to show your ID

00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,380
documents you're going to say whether

00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:51,169
you confirmed your own fingerprint in

00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:58,580
the file and you're also okay everybody

00:26:51,169 --> 00:27:00,820
hi can I just say one more thing so in

00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:03,470
addition to saying and this is it to the

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,990
critical pieces here you are also going

00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,610
to say in one sentence and everybody

00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:11,240
else in the group keep people honest one

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:13,160
sentence what do you do for Debian one

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:17,230
sentence and then you're also going to

00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,230
say what is your favorite food

00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,009
[Music]

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,670
so we didn't

00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:47,230
I don't need I don't know why you guys

00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,230
marked to me

00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,750
