	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
have a opportunity for interaction

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,309
hopefully reasonably informal

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,840
interaction between those of you from

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,280
the project who are interested and the

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,590
members of the Technical Committee who

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,650
are present let's start by introducing

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:22,109
ourselves i'm BDL Garvey and keith

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:32,369
packard ian jackson russell berrie call

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:36,450
Dan Watson steve longo check great yeah

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,730
well so what I'm gonna so in fact we

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,800
have present today a six of the eight

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,200
current members of technical committee

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,850
Andy Barth could not be here at dub comp

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,469
this year and Don was here over the

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,329
weekend I understand though I didn't

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,460
actually get to see him I understand

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:56,070
he's taken off for another event this

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:58,079
week it is Burning Man week after all so

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,149
for those of you who don't is there

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,520
anyone who is sort of completely

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,880
clueless about what the Debian technical

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,500
committee is okay there's always a

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,630
straight man to me thanks Rocky

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,390
the Technical Committee is defined by

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,210
the Debian Constitution and it has a

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,549
fairly limited but significant role in

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,979
the project there are four to eight

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,710
members at any given time appointed by a

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,000
combination of the sitting WM project

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,479
leader and the current members of the

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,820
committee section 6 of the Constitution

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:38,189
covers sort of what the behaviors of the

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,320
committee are expected to be it's

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,880
important to understand that the focus

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,820
of the technical committee is supposed

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,450
to be on technical policy and in places

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,909
where action might be taken or things

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,329
like developers jurisdictions

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,820
overlapping and an inability to come to

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,399
a resolution on which of multiple

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,009
technical alternatives is the best one

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,159
to go forward with we tend to only act

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,759
when we are explicitly asked to engage

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,410
in a particular decision process the

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,900
committee does have the authority to

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,650
overrule a developer though as Steve was

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,360
pointing out

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,799
and another session yesterday evening

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,870
there's an interesting little loophole

00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:20,909
where it does not appear that we have

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,840
the ability to overrule a delegates

00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,830
decision which means that some

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,629
infrastructure related technical

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,440
decisions could be interesting for us to

00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:35,040
deal with we have the right to offer

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,720
advice in addition to making sort of you

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:46,920
know so I'd only the Technical Committee

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:48,629
has that right sorry I think the the

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,730
point is it's possible for us to engage

00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:53,609
in a conversation with developers and

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,560
provide you know some sense of wisdom

00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:58,170
without necessarily having to make a

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,299
decision that requires a vote but this

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,629
always gets a little weird there are a

00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,159
couple of interesting sort of limiting

00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:07,109
features one is that according to

00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,239
Constitution the committee's not really

00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:11,250
supposed to engage in the design of new

00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,470
proposals remembers the committee of

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,569
course are also developers and may very

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,299
well be very involved in helping to

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:21,180
design new solutions and it's almost

00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:24,560
impossible for a group of technologists

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,790
to discuss any open question without

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,470
postulating wouldn't it be nice if we

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,349
had a third alternative or a fourth

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,269
alternative or a fifth alternative so

00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,769
it's this is an interesting one that you

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,540
know we can be challenged a little bit

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,639
sometimes in our discussions to remember

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,169
and then finally the Technical Committee

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,040
is supposed to be a decision of last

00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:46,739
resort in almost all cases it's better

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,510
for Debian if the decisions are made by

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,049
the developers who are working on the

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,030
particular piece of technology and in

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,470
fact Steve was commenting this morning

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,560
it's interesting we've had a few cases

00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,660
in the last year where issues have been

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,150
brought to the committee or to some

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,010
subset of the committee informally or

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,169
otherwise and we've been able to provide

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,599
some advice and things have you know

00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,819
been able to happen without actually

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,680
having to bring a formal issue in front

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,289
of the committee for specific action

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,630
that's all cool it's great the point is

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,120
that we're trying to help and to help

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,710
deal with situations where the normal

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,159
processes of the project just aren't

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,110
cutting

00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:28,120
one of the things that we instituted a

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,030
couple of years ago is actually a

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,689
suggestion from Zach which is worked out

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,930
really well

00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:37,180
we read meat roughly monthly on IRC to

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,370
discuss the currently open issues and

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,479
you know go to each other on to do

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,669
things about them

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,340
Donna Armstrong has been running those

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,460
meetings manages an agenda that we

00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,840
maintain in our shared get repository

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,090
and the minutes of all those meetings

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,860
are available somewhere I'm not sure

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,590
where you look for them but they are

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,020
around and of course anyone you'd like

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,389
is welcome to hang out with us on the

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:05,349
the appropriate IRC channel at the right

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:07,569
time and watch the discussion over the

00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:10,060
last year in kind of an interesting year

00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:12,550
for the committee there are five things

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,759
that were sort of officially brought to

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,800
the committee and got resolved since deb

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,229
cogs and Phil Marku last year that

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,169
started with adding a new member of the

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:25,330
technical committee keith was not a

00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:28,330
member of the TC invoke voom our COO

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,000
last year and is now that concluded a

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,129
fairly long process which I must

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,199
apologize was made longer because of

00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:38,319
various things that we're going on in my

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,259
life but we did eventually conclude and

00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,789
we now have a full eight which is the

00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,960
maximum number of members the

00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:46,599
committee's currently allowed to have

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,979
another Constitution I'm sure you'll all

00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,419
be shocked to hear that we spent a

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,960
little bit of time on an it systems in

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:55,379
the last year there was then a follow up

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,539
issue that was brought based on

00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:00,639
behaviors coming out of that decision we

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:03,069
recently finally got around to voting on

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,560
the question of what the default would

00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:08,860
JPG implementation where justice should

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,110
be and I put on here as well even though

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,440
it hasn't actually had a closure email

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,199
yet this question of what the

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,740
appropriate this is of alternate

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,750
dependencies on non free things in Maine

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,389
we have all eight members of the

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,370
committee have now cast votes the result

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,960
is no longer than doubt that given

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,300
everything was happening in the run-up

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,720
to DEFCON fear that close your email on

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,210
that house

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,310
actually happened yet but that's at this

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,670
point I think resolved and okay to put

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,020
on that list there are four issues sort

00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,970
of officially before the committee right

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,120
now the first two have actually been on

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:49,960
our list for multiple years the first

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,200
one started as a proposed constitutional

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,230
tweak to fix a Technical Committee

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,490
supermajority issue in the Constitution

00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,670
given the events of the last year that

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:04,570
has not surprisingly now sort of

00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:08,290
exploded into I think six ish about six

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,700
sub topics all relating to the

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,210
membership of the committee what the

00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,950
terms of the the duration of terms of

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,810
service on the technical committee

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,120
should be how the tech committee

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,920
chairmen should be chosen how you know

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,290
there's a bunch of logistics things

00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,020
about the committee there's a suggestion

00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:29,110
that changing the Constitution to go

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,270
from eight to nine members having an odd

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,640
number might reduce the frequency with

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,970
which the casting vote which is now been

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:39,820
used once might ever have to be used

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,260
again all of those are good things all

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,350
of them are the sorts of things we want

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,400
to get right and not rush into so I'm

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,010
sure there'll be a lot more conversation

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,870
before we wrap that up but there has

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,310
been a lot of progress on that the list

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,960
of decisions on the web page being

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,729
incomplete someday somebody will sit

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,030
down and actually back to work that

00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:00,510
maybe there's an open question about

00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,630
menu systems this has to do with the

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:07,360
Debian menu versus the freedesktop.org

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:09,550
many specification files and you know

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,390
what why we have sort of two different

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:17,410
ways for specifies specifying GUI

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:19,570
application menu entries there's a draft

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,729
proposal the Keith put together that

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:23,919
we've had I guess a couple of rounds of

00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:25,390
conversation about in our monthly IRC

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,800
meetings there's certainly some more

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,320
work to do before we're ready to take

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,750
that to a vote though I think and then

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,849
relatively recently the question of the

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,860
main tanisha puh the aptitude package

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,360
has been brought to us and spend some

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,919
conversation about that I don't know

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,560
that I at least feel like we're very

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,330
close to any sort of specific decision

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,560
on that I guess before we just open up

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,120
to questions from the floor

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,430
or is there anything that any of you

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,080
would like to add in the way of comments

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,340
about either the things that got

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,480
resolved in the last year other things

00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,190
that are open right now or should we

00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,340
just open up and see what people want to

00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:01,290
talk about okay so with that we're open

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,150
to questions

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,370
this mic is loose on off we have another

00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,470
one in the room or not but if you would

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,440
like to ask a question or have something

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,020
you'd like to say procedural technical

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,779
whatever raising hand or something and

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,190
we'll be happy to take questions and

00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:22,420
converse about things as long as we have

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,040
time questions oh come on I'll go ahead

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,000
and I'll vamp for a little bit well oh

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,200
we've got a questionnaire in the back

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,790
and I'll talk as I deliver the

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:33,040
microphone so one thing I'm interested

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:34,960
to know one thing I'm interested know

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,910
from this group just as an informal poll

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,820
as as be Dale mentioned we did discover

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,529
that the there's an unintended

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,910
consequence of the fact that so many

00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,560
people are now delegated into their

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,750
roles in Debian which is now we've found

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,460
and the Secretary has actually ruled on

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,430
this as a constitutional interpretation

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,870
saying that we in fact don't have the

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,870
authority as the Technical Committee to

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,060
overrule delegates in their decisions

00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,260
which means nobody does as far as I can

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,000
tell other than like doing it straight

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,200
gr every time so I'm interested to know

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,830
maybe we can get some discussion about

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,089
that here but I'll pass the mic first to

00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:11,280
see whether the whether people think

00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:14,140
that's something we should fix how

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,300
elaborate do you want to prefer the

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,390
questions forwarded to the Technical

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,960
Committee because I have in mind the

00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:25,750
question of lip AV and ffmpeg and would

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,810
you like to have the back report it was

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,030
just these two words or some reasoning

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,450
or how because I think this question I

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,690
mean and that it has to be decided but

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,779
them here

00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,779
[Music]

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,080
sure I think it really helps when the

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,790
tech committee doesn't have to go to a

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,950
bunch of investigation that other people

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,830
already know one of the reasons Lib JPEG

00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,300
took so long was that we had to go well

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,790
partly because we were all distracted

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:09,510
with certain other extremely long

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:13,720
threats and partly because we had to go

00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:15,880
chase up a bunch of potential argument

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,190
for one side or another that had not

00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,760
really been fully presented in the

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,780
threat and it's much easier if we

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,850
actually have the arguments right there

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,660
in front of us and then we're not there

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:31,930
just trying to effectively work out

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:38,290
what's one side one side of the argument

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:40,510
of the other might be on our own so I

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,700
mean if there's something that's causing

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,670
a problem and it needs to be escalated

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,560
it would be better to escalate it sooner

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,780
when it needs to be than to spend a lot

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,490
of time trying to write up some kind of

00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,650
summary and have it agreed by everybody

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,600
this is particularly true if the thing

00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,790
is if it's very political and very

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,260
controversial for a for a simple

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,720
technical thing I'd certainly encourage

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,650
people to try and write up the dispute

00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:10,870
in some you know neutral friendly

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:13,600
constructive way but some issues that is

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,220
more difficult in which case we really

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,000
we're going to need everybody to put

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:21,100
their own side and in that case just

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,910
finding a bug against the TC is probably

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,170
the right approach that being said a

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,240
little bit of expectation management

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,150
here the question that's being posed on

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,890
Debian developer is can we have well

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,460
there's two questions can we have ffmpeg

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,950
back in for Jessie and can we switch

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:43,200
between lebay V and ffmpeg for Jessie

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,200
and the Jessie freezes coming up

00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,960
prospects of the technical committee

00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,760
being able to resolve this in the

00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,050
absence of the wider developer being

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,710
community being able to resolve it on

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,680
their own

00:12:50,710 --> 00:13:01,090
in the time required to make a decision

00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:02,770
for Jesse seems dicey also aren't both

00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:09,130
the security team in the release team

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:11,530
delegated they've only said they don't

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,610
want both of them in we could we could

00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:18,400
pick a different default without

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:19,930
overriding either team in practice while

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,390
we may not have the constitutional

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,130
authority to overrule them our

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,080
relationship with the delegated teams is

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,780
in fact very good and yeah

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,580
if we suggest it to a delegated team

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:36,790
that we would like a particular outcome

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:39,310
I think that that wouldn't really be too

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,370
big a problem unless we were completely

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:45,600
mad and hopefully we're not yeah I was

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,600
what I was mostly kidding on that

00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:59,259
hi um so is it fun for me to just

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,630
sit here or okay so Sam Hartman I guess

00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:03,660
I'd like to really thank you for doing

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,339
an excellent job over the last year

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:10,240
there's been a lot of mail on the

00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:12,430
technical committee mailing list and one

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,300
of the things I really appreciate is

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:18,310
that there are actually been a couple of

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:22,389
times when you know I see red when I

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,490
read read mail from from that I happen

00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:25,990
to have a different opinion on

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:29,529
interestingly not having to do with an

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:32,790
INT systems um but the thing is that I

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:35,079
really appreciate that that even then

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,839
the mail is written from a heartfelt

00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:42,009
desire to constructively make the

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,279
project better and I am really happy at

00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:46,269
all of the things in a number of threads

00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:48,579
especially the unit system thread but

00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:50,019
throughout everything where it's clear

00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:54,130
that you guys are trying to work

00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:55,660
together while actually understanding

00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,519
that there are some options that are

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,639
unacceptable to some members of the DC

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:15,850
and that's okay thanks for doing a great

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:18,490
job thank you so that's busy this trend

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,930
of trying to organize more sprints so

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:26,110
people do get to meet face to face I was

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:27,880
wondering if for example for an issue

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:32,050
that took as long as the unit system

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,370
would you could could flying all the GC

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,939
together in one place

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:40,389
we'd have certain shortens the our

00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:42,810
resolution period I think it probably

00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:46,930
would have done but it would have other

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,610
effects that we might not want the the

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,930
problem we'd run into I think would be

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:54,699
the transparency of that kind of thing

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:58,390
would be problematic we would have to

00:15:54,699 --> 00:16:04,300
video the entire meeting or something

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:07,000
right right I mean that that could be

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,740
done it would end up looking more like a

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,540
UN Security Council session or something

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,829
you know we'd all we would all be stood

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,110
round a table and there'd be a

00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:15,399
microphone each and when we broke for

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,149
lunch we wouldn't be allowed to talk

00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,740
about anything

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:23,170
you know which we just have to talk

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:25,420
about the weather right but if we wanted

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,790
to if we wanted to like you know make

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:31,810
that a transparent process we would have

00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,820
to go to those kind of lengths and that

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,680
I I'm not sure how much fun that would

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,390
be also some of us travel better than

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,310
others no I'm not sure I really want to

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,630
be flying around the country well I was

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,790
going to say to that the fact that

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,420
there's six of us here in one place at

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,920
one time is actually fairly unusual and

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:52,420
it's not that it hasn't happened before

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,700
but opportunities other than debconf to

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,649
get us all sufficiently motivated to put

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,779
the rest of our lives aside to go

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,370
somewhere at the same time together are

00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:01,750
really difficult to orchestrate and I

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,510
think it'd be very hard to do on short

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,850
notice and so the idea that you know

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,380
something's getting escalating to the

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,910
point where that would be a good process

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,949
to invoke and that you could actually

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,669
get all of us to get together in one

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:17,410
place quickly you know it sounds like a

00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,049
great idea and I'm sure most of us would

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,520
actually you know be happy to try it

00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:25,030
particular if there were you know good

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,750
food involved but you know at the end of

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,830
the day as frustrating as it can be

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:34,150
sometimes to watch the process and

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,669
believe me it's just as frustrating to

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,669
be involved in the process sometimes I

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:41,590
have to tell you that the fact that sort

00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:43,330
of everything every one of us thinks

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,490
about the issue about each other and so

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,280
forth ends up being you know documented

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:52,000
in an email thread that Don says now

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,590
helps stress test the VTS these are the

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,660
sorts of things this generates you know

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,740
it's a documentation record for

00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,720
everybody that comes afterwards

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,340
understanding how we got to where we

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,559
were and why we made the decisions we

00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,540
did and that degree of openness is

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,120
really really hard to even contemplate

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,879
wanting to move away from the other

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,299
thing that I would add

00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:13,729
that is that I at least think

00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,469
differently when I'm writing things up

00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:17,899
and email than when I'm discussing them

00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:21,229
in person so I find it much easier to

00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:24,199
reach a to reach a shared decision in

00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:26,179
person in ways that are possibly not

00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:27,769
good because it's a lot easier to fall

00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,789
into sort of a groupthink consensus when

00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:30,889
you're all in the same room

00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:33,679
whereas what I'm trying to write up

00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:36,169
detailed arguments on a thread it makes

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,789
me think harder and sometimes I end up

00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:39,679
convincing myself of something different

00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:43,909
in the process of writing the the

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,079
argument yeah and to some degree the

00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:47,299
arguments we have to present there's

00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:48,889
kind of an essay aspect to the work we

00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:52,819
do to do that which you don't have in

00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:55,849
the course of like a stand-up sort of

00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:58,279
face-to-face spoken meeting and that's

00:18:55,849 --> 00:19:00,049
that's useful in part for the

00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,149
transparency in part because it it

00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:10,789
challenges us to articulate our

00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:12,909
arguments better other questions oh come

00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,909
on

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:20,740
yellow let's look let's let's use the

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,720
rest of the time to work through the

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,730
constitutional issues we can just use

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,230
the rest of the Baath to sit here and an

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:37,510
on display we can talk through the

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:42,100
constitutional issues so I I'd like to

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:45,730
have some informal poll of my own how

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,080
many people would think that not having

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:55,450
that the committee would be an

00:19:47,080 --> 00:20:02,500
improvement yeah I think no in general I

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:10,230
mean yeah yeah right so how would you

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:12,429
like to do that show of hands good yeah

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,130
okay so show of hands how many people

00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:16,900
would prefer a Debian project in which

00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:21,210
there were no technical committee and

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,210
decisions of last resort went to a gr

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:36,190
that's completely fair right and yeah I

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,750
was gonna say we didn't hand out rotten

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:41,110
fruit in advance I'm not sure how best

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,750
to do this but yes right show of hands

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,470
how many folks think the current

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,270
constitutional structure with the

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:50,950
Technical Committee to make decisions of

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:52,480
last resort is a good system okay well

00:20:50,950 --> 00:21:00,370
certainly of the folks in the room that

00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:06,700
seems I was going to say this seems like

00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:07,990
a good so I guess maybe it's interesting

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,850
to explore that a little bit do you feel

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,080
that the Technical Committee do you feel

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,660
that way because you think the Technical

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,420
Committee has made poor decisions that

00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,610
it's that there's a lack of legitimacy

00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:23,530
to the decisions that it makes or is it

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:33,400
just because you've liked gee ours say

00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:37,860
definitely don't lie to us but also fear

00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:41,440
that the technical committees as a

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:49,450
self-selected group of people is not

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:57,700
working I mean as well as it could be

00:21:49,450 --> 00:22:06,190
and it seems like your or I feel that

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:11,470
it's become more tempted to overwrite

00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:13,480
people for something where it's their

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,150
area of responsibility

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,960
there are the choice that they've made

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:24,400
you might disagree with the choice but I

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:27,640
mean I think even if you disagree with

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:31,350
the choice that somebody's made and when

00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:35,390
it's they're aware of responsibility the

00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:39,030
threshold for saying I disagree with you

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:48,780
from saying that - I overruled your

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:50,400
decision should be higher that that's

00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,710
you know that's it that's it that's a

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,570
perfectly valid point of view B now can

00:22:52,710 --> 00:23:03,000
you put the list of decisions from last

00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:06,510
from this last year back up so right so

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,690
this this does not include us having

00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:13,010
overruled anybody the previous year we

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:16,110
overruled Gill game on multi arch and

00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:18,060
you could argue about whether live JPEG

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:22,530
we didn't actually formally use the

00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:24,600
overriding par but it was kind of well I

00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,750
mean that was like two camps there's the

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:32,460
JPEG turbo competetive JPEG eight camp

00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:33,960
and it's a bit it's a there's a

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,650
difference between us saying well we're

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,070
going to overturn the status quo when

00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:44,370
really there are it's not really obvious

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:46,920
that that the live JPEG eight-count just

00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:48,960
by having got there first I mean maybe

00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,790
you disagree but I doesn't feel like

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,340
overhauling to me

00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:55,410
the Gilliam's multi arch thing was

00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:05,250
probably the biggest decision we took in

00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:08,220
the previous year and the network

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,650
manager was the most contentious

00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:16,470
decision that we took and we did

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:18,210
overrule there now you can you know

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,340
maybe maybe that's what the kind of

00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,960
thing you're thinking of the thing that

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,100
the decision with the biggest impact on

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,770
the project was the multi artists

00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:32,190
decision and having looked at what's

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:33,750
happened since I think we would I now

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,980
think we were probably right to do that

00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:43,590
it's not completely clear but I'm not

00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:45,150
unhappy though that's what we did I also

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,520
wanted to add you know I mentioned when

00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,870
we were talking about the open bug about

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,670
the super majority for

00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,280
and so forth that that's now popped into

00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:55,350
about a half-dozen subtopics and a

00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,300
couple of them are specifically about

00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,830
the composition of the committee whether

00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,980
there should be something like a term

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:05,160
limit on participation in the committee

00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:06,960
I think the current best idea for

00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,400
managing the chairmanship of the

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,110
committee was the notion that the

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,670
committee ought to the elect its

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,580
chairman every time there was a change

00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:16,050
in the membership or composition of the

00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,020
committee there are a number of things

00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:21,240
like that that are currently that we're

00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,040
currently discussing that might sort of

00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,170
affect the other side of this which is

00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,290
how do you know that the committee

00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:30,120
remains sort of vital responsible

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,309
connected to the project and all those

00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,900
sorts of things and this is why I say I

00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:37,530
don't think we're really quite ready to

00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,660
you know vote in the large on exactly

00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,010
what the constitutional change should be

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,770
because I don't know that we've really

00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:46,650
gotten to the end of the thought process

00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,929
about how that should work in puts today

00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,400
or at other times about you know you're

00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:51,780
thinking about how that should work

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,820
particularly if you're willing to go

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,740
look at some of the discussion we've had

00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,650
particularly in our IRC meeting logs

00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,850
about this topic and you know let us

00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,790
know what you think of some of the

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:05,130
proposals that are floating around the

00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,980
sort of how people get on the committee

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,450
you know whether it should be a more

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,570
elected kind of thing or whether the

00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:15,300
current process of selection remains the

00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,980
right one with some tweaks around sort

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,590
of term limiting kind of things or not I

00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,550
suspect is another topic that we could

00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,980
have some really interesting

00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,929
conversation about but I would suggest

00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,059
that you think about both sides of that

00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:28,740
one side is sort of the the how did

00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,570
decisions get made and how does

00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,030
overruling happen and so forth and the

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,950
other is the sort of how do you actually

00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:38,490
decide whether you're able to trust that

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,740
the people making up the committee you

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,110
know or sort of doing the honorable

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,990
thing at all times and those are I think

00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:48,840
both reasonable topics for us to have

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:51,090
lots of conversation about and regarding

00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,820
the the actual matter of overruling of

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,950
maintainer zyv I know this is a common

00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,570
sentiment nobody likes to be overruled

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,900
nobody likes to see their peers

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:02,190
overruled but there's two points that I

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,870
think we should look at there

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,450
as has been pointed out the actual

00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,580
frequency with which overruling a true

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,610
overrule happens and the other is the

00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,799
aspect that even having the question

00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,809
come up is very psychically draining for

00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,700
a maintainer or a developer to even have

00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:21,240
to go through that process and yes when

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,159
that happens it's not not good well we

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,600
don't however the detectors right right

00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,840
the Technical Committee does not as a

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,519
body initiate that process those things

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,440
the questions of overruling a maintainer

00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,019
only arise because some developer is

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,700
concerned that the the wrong decision

00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:40,710
has been made the it's it's probably

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,409
also worth pointing out the only times

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,450
this ever comes up are essentially when

00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:46,649
things have already gone badly wrong you

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,580
know somebody is somebody is very

00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:53,970
dissatisfied enough to crank the process

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,500
up to 11 and bring it to the tech

00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,870
committee that's maybe been a little

00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:02,370
more frequent neither has been in

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:04,500
previous years but the it's it's not a

00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:07,580
it's generally not obvious that doing

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:11,789
nothing would be an improvement there's

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:14,070
there's always some project wides or at

00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:16,470
least very large contention involved

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,029
before it gets anywhere near us so we

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:23,970
essentially only deal with things that

00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:25,049
are already in about stairs one more

00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,629
quick thing I want to say on that topic

00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:30,120
though it's that um the other problem

00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:32,519
with that whole with that with all that

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,049
is that while overriding and even

00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,370
discussing an override is hugely

00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:37,409
psychically draining and hard for the

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,539
people involved the other side of that

00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:41,909
is is that not having a decision is also

00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:43,919
psychically training and so one of the

00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:45,230
things that that hopefully the Technical

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,519
Committee helps with and I think that

00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,600
our track record has been mixed in part

00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,059
because it takes us so long to make

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,110
decisions for other good reasons is that

00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:55,879
if you reach some sense of closure

00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,879
sometimes that's better even if you lose

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:04,240
right I mean what you don't see

00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:06,580
interestingly on that is we get quite a

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,860
few incoming issues of one kind or

00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:15,250
another where the submitter is is is is

00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,390
aggrieved somehow and usually just like

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,060
one member of the Technical Committee

00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,430
writes back and says really we're we're

00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,110
not we don't think we're going to

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:26,230
overrule or maintain on this this is

00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,550
just this you know you haven't explained

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,960
what the problem is or this isn't

00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,250
seriously enough for whatever the

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,250
whatever the situation is and

00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:39,400
essentially that really you know that

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,550
that helps the maintainer to to not have

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:45,940
to do with that issue anymore because

00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:48,010
essentially the the complainants routes

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,180
avenues have been closed off but there's

00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,630
another thing I wanted to say which is

00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:55,410
you know we don't like being overruled

00:29:51,630 --> 00:30:01,570
Debbie and of course in theory we put

00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:04,810
the needs of our users first and what

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:09,280
that means is that as a maintainer our

00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:11,290
responsibility is to our users and if a

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,760
maintainer is failing in that

00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,860
responsibility it's the responsibility

00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,380
of the project as a whole to set them

00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:19,150
straight and obviously that's not

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,940
necessarily a pleasant experience for

00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:24,010
the maintainer but most of us he uses

00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,810
too right so we've been on the other

00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:30,210
side of a bug report where the

00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:30,210
maintainer seems not to be listening and

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,970
behind each one of us who's articulate

00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:37,900
enough to have a you know to try and

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,250
have that conversation with the

00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,910
maintainer and who understands the

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:44,890
process well enough to to deal with that

00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:47,560
there's probably a bunch of users who

00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:54,990
are upset and don't know what to do

00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:54,990
about it yeah fair enough yes

00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:06,070
so I'm a nerd and I have one comment and

00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:10,440
a question the comment is that being

00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:14,009
overruled by a gr is probably worse than

00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,320
being overall by the Technical Committee

00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:23,229
there are far more relationship damaged

00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:25,690
if you are ruled by idea so the question

00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:28,299
that I have for that is is in the past

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:31,149
one of the reasons people didn't bring

00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:34,649
things before the DC was the lag time

00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:36,879
before a decision could be reached I

00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:38,769
understand that while I have been

00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:41,109
missing things have improved because

00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:46,539
when the TC never used to have that

00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:50,499
means breaker is this something that you

00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:54,309
guys are considering streamlining or are

00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:57,940
there ways that we could reach consensus

00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:59,289
faster I mean flying people together was

00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,479
one of the ways that people are

00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:04,119
proposing getting there but if that's

00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:06,070
not the answer what is so so actually as

00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:07,779
I mentioned earlier Zacks suggestion and

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:10,239
coupling I guess was actually in Banja

00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:11,739
Luka that we had that I think it was

00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:13,029
then that we had the conversation it

00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:16,210
took a little while to get started but

00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:18,249
this business of having a monthly IRC

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,919
meeting has been I think really helpful

00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:23,710
because it causes all of us to have sort

00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,629
of a pseudo deadline once a month to go

00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,849
remind ourselves what our action items

00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:29,349
were and decide whether we have time to

00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:30,599
do something in the last hour before the

00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:36,489
meeting

00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:38,679
if you graph my activity it would but

00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:40,659
but but honestly I think just reminding

00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:42,460
ourselves on a regular cadence of what

00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:44,559
issues are open and where they are and

00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,970
and who said they do what who hasn't

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,769
gotten to it yet and should somebody

00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:52,869
else try to pick that up has been really

00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:55,599
helpful so concretely things have

00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:58,330
improved if you come to the TC now with

00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,220
a decision that's not enormous ly

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:03,009
politically charged and where most of

00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:05,619
the TC members agree one way or the

00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:08,799
other you will probably have a decision

00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:10,980
in a month or two or maybe three now

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,770
that sounds like a very long time

00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,270
but given how long it takes to make any

00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,620
other kind of decision in Debian

00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,230
particularly a decision to change

00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:23,880
anything that's that's kind of lightning

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:25,880
fast by Debbie under standard sir so and

00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:31,620
and we have sometimes being faster we

00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:33,720
you know we've managed one week so sorry

00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:37,710
I can um burr of things accumulated um

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,540
one I guess I don't did a secondary one

00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,950
Manoj said don't discount the

00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,540
possibility the reason you're seeing

00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,850
more overrides is that you're actually

00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,580
effective these days

00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:48,750
and that basically it's not that people

00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,600
are being more litigious

00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:54,000
it's that issues that people wouldn't

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,860
would have just taken the hit to say

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,660
I'll never get this fixed I have no

00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,760
recourse they're realizing they have

00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:03,000
recourse and I think that's a good for

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,950
the project number two I don't know how

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,940
I feel personally but baby I'll ask the

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:10,710
question of BS Steve asked the question

00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,970
of should we should the TC be able to

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:17,790
overwrite delegates I'm still pondering

00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:23,129
this but here's a devil's advocate

00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:25,500
argument for why not which is that the

00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:27,060
important thing an important thing from

00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,659
a governance standpoint is to have a

00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,340
check and balance on individual

00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:35,580
decisions to help keep them in alignment

00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:37,619
with with the project for individual

00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,300
maintainer x' there isn't really a check

00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,220
and balance besides the TC and peer

00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,040
pressure

00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:46,710
GRS are a option of even last resort but

00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,300
they're really a heavy weight but for

00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,070
delegates there are a couple of check

00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,970
and balances first of all we tend to

00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:56,159
delegate teams rather than individuals

00:34:52,970 --> 00:35:01,400
second of all while the while you can't

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:05,070
be undeleted while while the DPL can

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:08,070
revoke can't you know do something

00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,420
because of a decision your track record

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,910
can be considered and whether a

00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:16,170
delegation is removed and so there are

00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:17,850
other checks and balances and you know

00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,320
it would be and it would also be good

00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:23,460
from a government standpoint not have a

00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,390
body having too much power um one thing

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,089
that

00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:29,789
it would be interesting to look at is do

00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:33,539
a retrospective on some of your issues

00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:36,000
that you raised and how effective it has

00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:38,400
been I will call two to mind one is

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,099
network manager um you know I'll note

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,470
that there was a lot of effort and hard

00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:45,539
I spent on network manager and yet the

00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,750
way it ended out pretty much you get

00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:50,400
network manager if you install genome

00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:53,880
and it really is kind of hard not to get

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,289
it and it's still the case that you can

00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,049
get into situations where your

00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:59,609
networking doesn't work if you install a

00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:01,410
system and you know network manager

00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:04,200
thinks it's supposed to be managing it

00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,390
and and yet there's nets the interfaces

00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,460
involved I've actually seen particular

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:11,099
on live DVD installs getting into some

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,329
kind of impressive network manager

00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:15,420
fights with the rest of the system

00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:17,099
issues so you know was it actually worth

00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,900
the pain there and I don't know what the

00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,789
answer is but it might be worth going

00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,970
back and thinking about that and then

00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:25,829
I'll get on system D um you know it's

00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,829
really hard to install a system without

00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:32,009
a Jesse system without system D is hid

00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:33,599
one if you install any significant set

00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:36,210
of software and I don't think that was

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:42,269
quite what was envisioned during the

00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:45,150
discussions okay excuse me I'm sorry

00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:47,789
yeah I'm sorry in I do not believe that

00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:52,289
that was what the people voting for

00:36:47,789 --> 00:37:01,140
system D quite envisioned at the end of

00:36:52,289 --> 00:37:03,960
that TC discussion yeah right okay but

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,670
but okay but anyway um and one final

00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,450
note is you talked about how painful it

00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:11,819
is to override a maintainer there are

00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:15,930
skills in terms of empathic

00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:17,910
communication and working with people to

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,309
actually communicate with them in less

00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,619
painful ways that it actually would

00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:25,740
probably be worth the TC spending time

00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:29,730
learning because we actually as a

00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:32,670
project could work to make disagreements

00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:37,940
less painful and you as leaders can help

00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:37,940
lead the way interesting thoughts

00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,750
yeah it is on I don't fit strength is

00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:48,500
that working okay cool

00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:51,050
one one wanted comment on the like

00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,130
what's happened subsequently well it was

00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,500
something that we discussed as a

00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:58,069
possible thing that could happen during

00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,690
the discussion I at least was completely

00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:02,690
surprised by the speed at which

00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:06,040
canonical essentially moved away from

00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:08,750
upstart and that significantly changes

00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,460
the the the what it looks like going

00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,490
forward in the archive for multiple

00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,349
Annette systems because that was like

00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,579
the other big one right so I think that

00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:18,890
some of the room some of the reason why

00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:22,160
now it looks like system D all the time

00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:23,540
was because canonical made this decision

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,890
like almost immediately after this so

00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,839
you and Steve probably has more insight

00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,040
into that but that was at least to me

00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:29,810
that was a lark that was significant

00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,069
surprise the reason it looks like system

00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,200
D all the time is because of some of

00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:35,089
these questions of how good does the

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,010
compatibility have to be for things like

00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:39,319
login D to allow it as an alternative

00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:41,810
have led to the desktop systems which do

00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:43,520
require a d-bus interface which is

00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:46,640
provided by system D and they're pulling

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,000
in system D by default we're at the

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,560
point today where I think even now

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,240
testing I think you've you installed

00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,220
gnome it pulls in system B as paid one

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,900
and there's some some a little bit of

00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,660
work that we may have to do to clean

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:02,660
that up yet I don't know exactly where

00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:06,470
that stands I think I think system D in

00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:10,160
the in the archive in testing has the

00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:11,599
necessary or dependency but that the

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,940
version of system D shim that has made

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,800
it into testing is an at a level that

00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,540
provides that compatibility so that's

00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,640
actually that's that's my fail for not

00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:23,020
falling through on that and I'm working

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,020
with the FTP team to fix that

00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:29,190
um can I can I stand up and have a show

00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:32,760
of hands can I do a sure go ahead yeah

00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:34,110
okay um and my name is Martin I just

00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,170
wanted to follow up on something that

00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:39,450
Russ said earlier and he I'm gonna quote

00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:43,260
you not verbatim but he said that

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:44,760
sometimes closure is worthwhile to work

00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,220
for and you don't necessarily need

00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,620
consensus for everything I would like to

00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,540
put you in the situation that we are in

00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,640
we are a group of people that are

00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,220
volunteers and working on a common goal

00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,320
we also have a Technical Committee that

00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:01,110
we have all voted early on to be the

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,880
sort of like neutral objective body to

00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,980
make final decisions in case we can't

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,990
come up with them I would really like to

00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,580
see a show of hands in this very

00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:12,180
representative crowd of the Debian

00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:14,160
project between what you would really

00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:18,630
prefer if you had to choose one of the

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:22,200
two option one being endless discussion

00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:25,020
or the discussion until you have until

00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,510
you have consensus which we have been

00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,360
known to reach so this is not a garden

00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:34,020
path dead end it's just gonna take a

00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,220
long time an option to realizing at some

00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,630
point in time that this is going to take

00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,760
a long time so deferring it to a

00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,680
committee who then makes a decision that

00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:46,280
not everybody likes but brings us

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:48,510
closure alright there's only two options

00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,160
you-you-you ratify the proposal right

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,520
for the discussion is part of the

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,520
proposal

00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,570
so could I see a show of hands for those

00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,490
people who would prefer option a which

00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,970
is long discussions until you have

00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,970
consensus

00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:22,480
this is a bad question because the

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,070
reason that you have the Technical

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,480
Committee is that you hope that these

00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:31,240
people are sensible enough to strike a

00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:33,070
balance between those two options so

00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,270
there is no question they're there to

00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:37,900
decide what is the right balance between

00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:41,140
those two extremes actually if we modify

00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:44,470
the the proposal one or my team

00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:47,859
are we try instead of it going for an

00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:49,840
absolute consensus if we decide to go

00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:52,270
for their rough consensus instead where

00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:56,440
you don't need to have absolutely the

00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:59,050
last project member a green that might

00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:03,340
be more reasonable than discussion and

00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:06,070
everybody is convinced as the newest

00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:08,410
member of the Technical Committee I was

00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:11,170
a little unaware of the long history of

00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:14,050
the process the Technical Committee and

00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:15,720
I was the init system debate well I

00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,070
think contentious within the committee

00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:23,339
what's the one for so we only have one

00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:25,690
minute left okay faster faster okay

00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:26,920
while it was very contentious I think

00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,300
what raised within the Technical

00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,859
Committee was the notion that the

00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,140
Technical Committee itself does not have

00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:35,310
to come to consensus to resolve an issue

00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:38,650
and that our existing voting process was

00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:40,599
sufficient in order to come to closure

00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,339
it didn't make everybody happy but I

00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,890
think if the Technical Committee would

00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:48,970
take a more principled view on using

00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:51,190
constructing a vote and taking a vote

00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:53,230
and calling the issue at an end

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,790
but when issues are clearly not going to

00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,470
be resolved quickly that we could make

00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:59,109
process we could make progress more

00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:00,490
quickly oftentimes we do spend a lot of

00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,080
time the Technical Committee trying to

00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:04,330
generate total consensus among the

00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,160
technical committee and for some issues

00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:08,920
that makes a lot of sense but I think we

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,619
need to be more aggressive in taking

00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,440
votes instead and getting to majority or

00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:16,930
rough consensus as Manoj says instead of

00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,190
trying to get to a total consensus of

00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:21,460
the committee and using our existing

00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:24,010
process to resolve issues more quickly

00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,960
with a with by coming to rough consensus

00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,710
or even just majority seems like a

00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,119
process that we

00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:31,420
should be using more often rather than

00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:33,670
less often okay well I think with that

00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,650
we really are just about at a time I

00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:38,500
have one thing that I wanted to say too

00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:39,849
in response to Sam which is as I

00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,200
mentioned the network manager we

00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:45,490
mentioned system D and I think that a

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,160
thing that has really disappointed me

00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:50,099
over the last couple of years in the

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,650
attitudes of some of my colleagues is

00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:56,050
their position towards the defense of

00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:59,520
minorities in Debian by which I don't

00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:03,780
mean you know blacks and gays I mean

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:07,720
people who choose a decision that is

00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:11,500
unpopular and recently we've seen a lot

00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:15,940
of those communities losing out and I'm

00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,770
hoping that this won't carry on okay

00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,420
well with that I think we really are out

00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:22,000
of line thank you very much for being

00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:23,500
here I know that most of us are going to

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,690
be around for at least part of the week

00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,089
we certainly would encourage you to come

00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:31,900
find us have more conversation ask

00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:34,119
questions this discussion the Technical

00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,560
Committee processes etc don't stop at

00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,109
the end of this meeting they keep going

00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:40,119
so feel free to stay engaged and and

00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:42,010
help us in any way that you would like

00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:42,650
to thank you very much for your time and

00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,829
attention

00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,829
