are you sitting comfortably good

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,660
afternoon ladies and gentlemen and

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,330
anybody else who happens to be watching

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,369
as is traditional every year this is the

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,939
bits from the DPL so I would like to

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,939
welcome the one and only Lucas Nussbaum

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:38,610
thank you for coming that's time so to

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,260
start this talk I want you to look back

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,809
a bit about what we achieved as a

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,520
project since 2000 sliced year the probe

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,309
last year but I think that this was a

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,129
great year for Debian first we made

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:54,719
decision the unit system debate system

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:58,980
choice that's so that was our but we

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,600
made it we set up LTS support for

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,229
squeeze that's also something that has

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:09,000
been discussed for a few years and it is

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:11,970
finally starting and working if you look

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,189
at what others think about Debian I

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,369
think that shows that the be honest

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,640
longer than ever as a foundation after

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:26,490
the decision of system D wouldn't follow

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,799
just a few days after that Valve choose

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,770
Debian as a basis for steam OS that

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,600
shows that people look at the beyond and

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,310
see a strong foundation for their own

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,210
projects and follow our technical

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,939
choices there has been many new exciting

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,409
developments Sushi's Debian network

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,549
guardian org

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,110
Deacon contributors DB NCI and many more

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,380
to come if you look at the schedule for

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,799
that cough and the Jessie Freese is

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,930
looking quite good we are down to 340

00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,310
our suburbs if you look at the stats for

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,500
the previous three disease which it

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,930
means that we are at about 21 weeks to

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,210
release so if you just hurry up a bit we

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,140
can release by Christmas basically well

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,720
that may be that's with the green but

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:16,900
who knows we'll see

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,630
okay so I wanted to use that to talk

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,930
about things that were discussed quite a

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,280
bit during the DPN election and that

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,230
might be boring to some of you but I

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,300
think it's important that we take a look

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:32,560
at the debian the beiongs financial

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,200
status to understand where we are so in

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,230
fact all all values are in US dollars

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,940
since we are in the US which means that

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,970
even if you see a value about ffs is

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,070
usually which holds funds in you for

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,140
example or deviance eh I've converted it

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:53,050
using those weights that were the rates

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:55,750
of you a few days ago so first Debian

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,310
funds are not directly by Debian that

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,880
began using a set of trusted

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,860
organizations - so basically the

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,700
Deanna's bank accounts at several

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,800
organizations each organization provides

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,280
a different level of service and detail

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,920
about money as I add about the blonde

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,750
which means that doing all the stats

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,320
actually takes a lot of time and require

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,720
a lot of scripting so the current list

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,720
of Dibley untrusted organizations is the

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,240
following so we have SP on the US which

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,150
uses US dollars FF is in Germany that

00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,760
you did you a deep line France in France

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,820
which was Yahoo as well that confident

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,250
strand which uses euro and deviancy ash

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:43,530
in Switzerland which uses Swiss francs

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:48,070
so the current balance is the following

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:50,500
so for SPI the data is from the end of

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,040
June because I haven't bleached a report

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:57,040
for the end of July yet so two main

00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,370
trusted organizations for which we will

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,709
use the most for to make expenses are

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:07,930
SPI in the 50s that was a that's why is

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:10,170
the iron bolt well we have about thirty

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:14,470
thousand dollars at both ffs is in

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:20,410
regions here H $4,000 the gun fans and

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:22,479
zero a deposit at the compliment so what

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:31,610
is more interesting

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:33,639
okay I didn't ask I should ever so more

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,520
interesting that the current balance

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:40,250
let's look at oh it changed over time so

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,300
so that graph is about SPI that one is

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:47,479
about 50s I did not generate it for the

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,280
gents eh it's probably less or less

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,740
interesting to look at is the most

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,970
lizard Deb concert in surplus

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:58,490
so for SPI it's a purple part so that's

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,460
time cuz I'm not sure if you can read in

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,940
the back of the room that's 2009 that

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,699
2014 the purple part is diggin phones

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,850
and various other parts of our phones

00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:16,190
for various debconf editions so blue one

00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:18,500
is the protein that's the protein etc so

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,169
one can see that it has been increasing

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,750
quite steadily especially during the

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:27,200
last two years thanks to the great work

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:31,389
done by the cost thirteen sponsoring

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,389
team probably for the probe yeah

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,330
for before Def Con 14 is going to blot a

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:43,500
little because there are things to pay

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:46,410
and not there for free but still it is

00:05:43,500 --> 00:06:01,740
expected that that cost 14 which will

00:05:46,410 --> 00:06:03,450
also generate a surplus so it looks a

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,150
bit exponential actually in the end I

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:12,240
don't think it still it's a bit scary

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:14,430
for FF is it's a lot more stable it has

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,890
been going down a bit recently that's

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,670
just because we have been using if it is

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:23,240
FF ideas for what a lot of quite large

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,950
expenses since the beginning of the year

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,430
that's actually starts in 2002 so you

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:37,020
see that that has always been between

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:40,880
almost zero and $60,000 so I try to look

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:45,150
at various aspects that are related to

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,530
the unmanifest donations so I've passed

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:51,480
data about political donations to SPI

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,340
account so zoo donations are processed

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,410
through a third-party service called

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,960
chicken pledge so if you go to the

00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:00,090
attendant box lab donations web page

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,070
I'll get a link if you want to donate

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:05,130
value is PR you get a link to a page

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,130
that looks like that and actually what's

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,960
important for the next slide is that

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,940
that form enables you to donate to

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,740
various organizations not just Debian

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,000
which have a long list of organizations

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:23,340
where you can which you can donate to so

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,400
that's actual numbers so the just yeah

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:30,840
of course that the total donation to

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:34,890
Debian for the given year for 2014 that

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:37,740
subscribe to a few days ago that the

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,600
total donations total donations where

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,630
they began was involved so what happens

00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,910
is that you can go to that page and

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:48,590
decide to donate

00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:52,250
50 burrows 102 Debian and 50 to another

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,890
organization for the poll open wot so

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:58,100
that's a total of donations that's that

00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:02,210
could be 150 and that's 100 that goes

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:05,780
within the one can see that the median

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:09,490
value for donations is actually really

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,100
stable we get a lot of small donations

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,140
it's important to remember that that

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:19,520
lots of individuals giving a small

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:22,040
amount of money to Debian it's actually

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,900
fairly stable if you consider the fact

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:29,930
that in 2010 2001 11 2012 we got three

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,510
large donations using credit cards so if

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:36,820
you remove that basically it's stable of

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:40,370
azalea's it's it looks like we are a bit

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:44,510
lower than well we are we sort of the

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:47,150
year if you multiply it by one we do the

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,970
computation for 2014 the projection

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,440
looks a bit low but that's also probably

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,210
expected because we get lots of

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,250
donations at the end of the year I think

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:58,070
that's because US citizens debate tax

00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:00,860
report at the end of the year and the

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,660
point of time was they decide that it's

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,320
a good idea to give to give to a to the

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,740
left

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,830
this imperative is a big month for our

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,900
donations so just if you have

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,680
clarification questions about that just

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,680
just ask

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,199
so now that all the script errors also

00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:33,600
scripts are written yeah would be quite

00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:36,560
easy to regenerate oh yeah I would just

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,970
repeat the kind of questions that I

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,470
always asked as a debate that would be

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,470
available again at the end of the loom

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:49,139
so let's look at expenses so question is

00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:50,430
old as Debian spend money on what

00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,579
posision spend money on

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:56,699
so the first well big expense for Debian

00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:58,939
is that calm the budgets varies quite a

00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:01,350
lot depending on where the hostage place

00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:10,490
the video closed for example the

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:14,399
vibrator odd it's between 150 K and 2001

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:20,300
$50,000 failure including travel

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,300
sponsorship for this joy it was $42,000

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:28,920
this banquet of money and other kind of

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,740
travels for Sprint's some but not so

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,949
much on Didion developers depending

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,630
traveling to obscene conferences they

00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:41,550
took that occurred two or three times

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:44,339
this year I think we found some other

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:47,399
events for example meaning that comes to

00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:51,060
is to make it easier for people to four

00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,930
speakers travel to need at home we

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,189
funded

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,839
trails at fest in July we also spent

00:10:56,189 --> 00:11:01,769
quite a lot of money on infrastructure

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,290
so our way of course but also stuff like

00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:08,880
yes domain names

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:11,939
SSL certificates are violently so I

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,980
don't have the data to detect breakdown

00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:16,980
for SPI which would be more interesting

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,139
but actually got more work to do

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,939
since the data for I have FF i yes so

00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,600
it's mostly an example because the

00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:26,370
amount spent on as FF is is a bit as

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,949
much coercion at spi

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:32,360
but it shows that basically it's leaked

00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:37,870
about evenly between infrastructure

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:42,620
and probably related so some sorts about

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:44,710
that first I think that before talking

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,420
about service I think it's important to

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:50,150
say that we must respect our donors and

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,270
to use their donations to improve the

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,860
plan so that's actually it's quite

00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,350
interesting well there are two sides to

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,870
this first thing is we should use the

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:02,030
donations to improve the beyond but we

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,850
sure should also use where donations and

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,430
if they donate money to Debian I don't

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:10,280
think that it's quite right

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:12,140
just a bit sitting in a bank account of

00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:17,620
course it's important that we have some

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:20,380
amount of reserve in case of well

00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:25,730
emergency expenses but it does it with

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:27,320
having almost 2001 and $50,000 in our

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:32,330
bunch of bank accounts might be a bit

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:35,450
too much so yeah my question we have

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:37,280
enough reserves we have basically what

00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,950
would be needed for one full DEP calm so

00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,080
I'm not encouraging that conflicting

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:48,080
team to fail completely

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:53,510
but still we could afford that please

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:56,750
don't we could probably improve on

00:12:53,510 --> 00:13:00,740
fundraising we are the boss dog this

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:03,220
morning about this lots of ideas hanging

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:06,890
around about out win through fundraising

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,690
I'm quite sure that if we were slightly

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:15,110
more aggressive we would be able to

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:17,390
waste a lot more and we sometimes feel

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:21,770
too guilty about using the vien money

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:23,540
I've heard of people who really core

00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,270
contributors with avianna spend a lot of

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:29,000
time on the beyond and we decided not to

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,860
come to depth off because I didn't feel

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,800
that it was right for the project to pay

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,830
for that further travel they couldn't

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,200
afford it themselves so not to apply

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:45,410
that's really sad because Robbie would

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:46,010
have been very useful to 12m here so we

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,750
are the disc

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,770
many nice discussion last year about

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:54,980
ideas for spending more money I've tried

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:57,710
to go through it and summarize it on

00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,230
this slide so I think that there are

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:02,360
many ways that we could use to make a

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:06,770
good use of Debian money and spend more

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,870
money the first set of ideas about

00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:11,990
increasing visibility of Debian at

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:15,610
attracting more contributors so we could

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,960
help more the organization of unit comps

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:21,470
that's a good way to reach out to our

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,990
users and potential contributors one way

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,240
to do that sponsor Debian developers to

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:30,710
travel to such iran's and talks talk

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,140
about julian development the second

00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:37,820
point is likely to be less conscience

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:42,710
sure i think that we could use some

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:45,290
money to just to send a signal to a new

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,870
contributors that we appreciate that

00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:50,030
they are contributing to debian welcome

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,900
them to our community

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:57,890
for example sending quite cheap goodies

00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:59,690
like on the order of a t-shirt a to two

00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,580
new contributors i think that's

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:05,690
something that we could that we could do

00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:09,710
I mean thinking of spending something

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:12,350
like $5,000 failure on that I think that

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:15,520
that would be quite reasonable and it

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:19,760
would be a first step first nice step

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,200
before while saying them self exams

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,260
after we noticed that they are starting

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,750
to contribute we kind of know that DM

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:30,050
while becoming a DNN dick of becoming a

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:36,230
DD is a really long pass but at least we

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:38,030
know that the other something else is

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:43,850
material for Didion boost so we have a

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:46,340
debian event team that that set up kind

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,280
of debian even box and descend to two

00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:53,990
evils mainly in Europe it's actually

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:57,940
kind of empty so it would be a good idea

00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:00,640
to work on buying stuff like banners

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:05,710
and wasn't materials that are frequently

00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:09,670
used appear conferences another thing

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:12,820
that was discussed is improving security

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:16,180
and first of jin-young's with the begin

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:22,780
archive by buying food for graphic cards

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:24,700
for Dedes we could also do more about

00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,730
improving the efficiency of development

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:41,560
organized prints so I think that's the

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:45,460
message I want to that's okay I'm quite

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,200
sure that not all of this as well some

00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,180
of this but might be a bit controversial

00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,920
let's discuss it at the end of the talk

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,700
let's not start a big discussion right

00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:57,100
now I also will be time to discuss this

00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:02,620
but if you have clarification questions

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:04,720
and finally taking them No so yeah so we

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,180
got into prints were quite a lot of

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,690
prints that are being organized mostly

00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:14,980
by core teams I think that we can extend

00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:18,250
to more teams and half we don't we don't

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,900
ask that many packaging team Academy

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:25,360
team is meeting in sprints

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:27,940
we could totally remove that so add were

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,400
used for the Gian development so I don't

00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:35,770
think that we can afford that in laptops

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:38,970
for again developers but when someone

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:42,010
needs specialized hardware could be

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:46,960
portal machines for Europe and machines

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:49,450
for porters last year we bought quite

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,470
powerful system so that one of the di

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:56,350
maintain us could do Bills of di at own

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,450
with the first machine does that kind of

00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,140
expenses I think that something that we

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,910
could do more as well and yeah and then

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,780
finally more travel sponsorship for that

00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,050
cough

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:11,490
I don't think that we can afford

00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:17,140
sponsoring every DMV

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:19,960
but probably we should look into not

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:23,380
sewing more or even a lot more like for

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,570
example for DMS it's quite nice to have

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,430
them at that point of get get indulge in

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:31,780
the community and that's usually well

00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:34,330
probably most of us realize that but

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,850
once you add that computer village lot

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:39,850
of people and not usually as a result

00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:45,100
you do more in the future in terms of

00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:49,290
Debian development then last point about

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,290
improving communication with upstreams

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,640
we could spend so Trevor and attendance

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:57,820
to some film conferences for example

00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:02,200
totally makes sense for the beyond to

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:05,170
sponsor travel and attendance to PyCon

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,850
for our Python developers we cannot find

00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,710
another way to work on and that's really

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,000
important with them to have a good

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,580
communication with our upstream

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,260
developers so I think there was a

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,500
suggestion at some point to have dinner

00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,810
once a year with your upstream I don't

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,680
think that the gun should be well maybe

00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:24,700
it depends on the kind of dinner but

00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,600
that's something that could be discussed

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:32,410
but if that's the kind of things that if

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:36,520
it contributes to the development why

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:41,230
not so just to be clear I'm actually in

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,720
favor or everything listed here so there

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,180
are things that clearly need

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:49,060
coordinators so if you want to volunteer

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:52,300
about we're working on then just contact

00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:55,870
me so just before moving on to the rest

00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:59,290
of the talk I like just to do a quick

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:01,210
show of hands for each item so that we

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,390
know where people stand so for each item

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,940
I would ask two questions who would be

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,980
in support of spendings of projects

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,230
money on this particular item who would

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,590
not be in support spending the project

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:16,630
money on a particular item so first one

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:23,040
organization of in-depth who would be in

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:23,040
support okay we wouldn't be in support

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:31,480
would you see in our current standing of

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:35,290
money opponents such thing probably

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:39,490
possibly to zero what country we are

00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:42,960
spending money on this so so goodies for

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,960
new contributors who would be in support

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,240
we wouldn't be in support

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:56,130
so I'd say about 70 of 80 percent of

00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,080
people I in support

00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,910
just give it just further what we do

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,600
because we are not regarding the room

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:07,000
and first hundred hundred percent for

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,740
the first items so material for the gang

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,080
booze would be in support we wouldn't be

00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:21,730
in support

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:23,650
okay so put in 80 or 90 percent picked a

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:32,260
pictographic smart cards for Dee Dee's

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:34,380
with in support who wouldn't be in

00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:39,390
support

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,390
okay so 90 percent at least

00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:52,600
Sprint's wouldn't support wouldn't be in

00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:54,340
support okay so 95 percent add were used

00:21:52,600 --> 00:22:01,000
for Debian development who would be in

00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:09,310
support who wouldn't be in support okay

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:10,870
100% I said no laptops no travel

00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,050
sponsorship product comp would be in

00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,050
support

00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:22,190
we wouldn't be in support okay hundred

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:24,259
percent and sponsoring travelers

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:28,509
attendance to opportunities we would be

00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:31,879
in support we would not be in support

00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:35,089
okay when what vessels okay so as kind

00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:37,729
of activities that must unpopular one is

00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:40,519
goodies when you contribute to us but as

00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:42,769
at least 70 persons report for all of

00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:44,779
them so we can we'll be able to discuss

00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:46,279
this at the end of the talk I make it

00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:48,579
quite short or so that we have time to

00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:51,739
talk about this I'm not going to just

00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:56,509
things that might be good points and the

00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:58,359
30 percent as a visibly so the second

00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:03,200
part of the talk we wanted to do some

00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:06,049
say think-tank about again so I don't

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:10,389
know who is familiar with SWOT analysis

00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:13,849
so the idea is to try to look at

00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:17,690
strengths weaknesses opportunities and

00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:19,909
threats to the beyond in that case and

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:23,599
look at yeah what can we build intended

00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:25,369
strength for what other opportunities so

00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,200
the difference between a strengths and

00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:30,829
opportunities or between weaknesses and

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,019
strengths is that strengths are in from

00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:36,589
an internal G origins as we ourselves

00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:38,599
that we build ourselves and opportunity

00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:40,999
has to have an external means that is

00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:44,859
terms that came from the outside just

00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:47,859
happen to apparent the same time as well

00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:47,859
currently

00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:57,079
okay so yeah weakness even sweat of

00:23:52,639 --> 00:24:00,820
things that are mighty and who it was

00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:04,700
now in the future so I try to do the

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:08,450
that work we might disagree with me so

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:12,950
let's go through it so first when I

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:14,209
think that what's quite really great in

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:18,950
the blend is that when you talk to

00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:22,050
people that a strong shared common ideas

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:25,560
and goes among contributors we all

00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:28,590
I feel very strongly about our general

00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:31,710
goals we might disagree on many small

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:37,200
details that's for example what is free

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:40,110
software and what isn't but still I

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,460
think that it's quite for an

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,030
organization that's really great that we

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:47,160
agree on so much and care so much about

00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:49,470
it that's also widespread agreement

00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,500
about our foundation documents and

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,880
procedures of course the secretary might

00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,510
sometimes I things to say about

00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:01,040
particular things but still we all care

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:04,350
deeply about respecting Swiss documents

00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,140
maybe even a bit too much I'd be a bit

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:11,760
too conservative sometimes about

00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:14,130
documents that everybody cares about

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,200
Debian and likes it even when not using

00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:20,610
it if you look at the system the debates

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,740
it was all over the news because

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,480
everybody looks at Debian and cares

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,320
about it and everybody loves Debian when

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,610
you go to conferences web kept calm and

00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:34,410
you say that you are involved in Debian

00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:37,250
everybody even using derivatives say

00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:41,730
that there are really big fans of Debian

00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:43,380
as a deep respect for for the project we

00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:48,860
have a large active community of

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:51,750
volunteers that's so I was wondering

00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:54,150
earlier this week as someone know of

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,870
larger free software projects other

00:25:54,150 --> 00:26:01,040
Libyan community projects I think that

00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:06,270
the gun is clearly by far the largest

00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:13,230
community free software project and that

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:16,800
works so well in some sense is really so

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:21,480
we have 1000 official developers plus

00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:24,540
about 300 GM's 240 PM's

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,850
plus a lot of people who are just

00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:30,810
contributing without any official status

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:33,330
and to a single project I mean if you

00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:34,880
take the icin community as a wall

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,540
probably

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,570
larger than that but to a single under a

00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:48,530
single umbrella I think that is really

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:50,780
large also did young is independent and

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,310
we don't compromise with it and that's

00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,800
that's actually something that is

00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,810
probably quite attractive to many other

00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,720
entities if you look at the companies

00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:02,330
from the company point of view the fact

00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,930
that someone can join the community and

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:09,320
don't feel like Sarge earning an inside

00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:12,440
company name shop is actually quite

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:16,460
great and Bobby that's why companies

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:21,020
like valve or more recently HP are

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:24,050
looking into working with Debian so in

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,450
terms of opportunities we're probably

00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:31,570
one of the few remaining large community

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:34,070
fully community projects and

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:37,270
distribution in terms of size were

00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,620
probably by far the largest many other

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:42,530
projects are becoming more and more

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:45,020
company oriented and I think that we all

00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,940
care deeply about the fact that the

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,940
women being remaining mostly independent

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:55,760
from any any company that's also

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:57,650
following all the Snowden stuff still

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,020
icky towards some big corporate players

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:03,170
and by being while having such

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:08,930
independence I think that we had a great

00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:11,570
position to succeed success you know

00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:14,840
let's look at the darker sides and our

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:20,450
witness is she just likes a bit longer

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:24,710
not good sign but first point is we tend

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:28,520
to well well large project but there's

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:30,230
some dispersion of manpower or so this

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,470
class will be available see people

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:36,050
taking to charge but just not that might

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:38,210
not be useful so as the dispersion of

00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,520
manpower we have a lack of mental as a

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:44,549
lack of manpower and core things most of

00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:46,830
our core teams are clearly

00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:49,139
like my like like help and we would use

00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,239
a lot of money but more health but also

00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:54,799
a lack of interest and contribute to us

00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:58,080
to non-technical tasks if you try to do

00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,509
auditors ba for a fundraising book you

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:06,239
will see that it was the most unpopular

00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:10,499
even tobacco habit to boast and that's a

00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:14,269
bit strange I mean that's important as

00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:16,619
well for the success of the beyond and

00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:18,029
it's why she's interesting she's so many

00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:19,739
people in favor of spending more money

00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:20,999
but at the same time not being so

00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:27,149
interested in attending a fundraising

00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:30,269
both there's some question that's

00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:32,009
probably an SPT the next day I never own

00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:35,639
avoidable due to the size of the Biondo

00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:38,909
Vasant alimentation inside Debian we are

00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:41,459
we tend to have teams that would become

00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:43,589
their own own projects and don't share

00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:45,479
that much today as much as they used to

00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:47,999
with the rest of the project the one

00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:49,979
good example is a gift packaging

00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:51,659
workflows for many years we had

00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:54,269
different workflows in each team

00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:57,659
basically so half adders are just having

00:29:54,269 --> 00:30:02,269
some work to try to move towards fixing

00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:05,399
that but still we probably could have

00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:09,239
more exchange more between teams another

00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:12,179
example is each scripting language that

00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:14,159
tends towards own solution for channel

00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,440
switching switches between transitions

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,289
between versions that's something that

00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,820
having a overview of what each team is

00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:25,399
doing and what are the pros and cons of

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,399
each solution could be quite useful

00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:33,649
packaging is difficult if even if when

00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:36,570
you talk to people who are really strong

00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:38,700
developers or system means and you ask

00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,679
them to do the first Debian package

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,559
usually it's quite hard for them as and

00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,239
the success rate is actually quite low

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,009
and this probabilities the use of a

00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:50,969
Kaji's a standard software distribution

00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:54,690
mechanism if it was easier to build the

00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:56,669
gen packages maybe we don't have so many

00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:01,120
alternative and language-specific

00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:04,929
packaging systems it's very difficult to

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:09,460
get started in the byung so I did

00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:12,520
recently I looked recently as at old I

00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,070
teepees and mostly I keep peace bursts

00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,260
and a lots of people who did the work of

00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,080
creating a Debian package for something

00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:23,860
and we gave up because they could not

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,010
find a sponsor we also have quite high

00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:29,710
requirements about quality most of the

00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,870
package had managed to get sponsored out

00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:35,110
of mentor the probably of much higher

00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:40,600
quality on average some packages gg's

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:42,490
upload well without in the review maybe

00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,220
that's a bit unreasonable and we just

00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,710
should just find blogs about my nose

00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,429
should not care so much about Lynch and

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,429
pedantic tags

00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,360
it was also some disconnection from

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,320
upstream for many maintenance by that I

00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:03,130
mean that the dam maintain works on it a

00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:07,000
cage but as never exchange an email to

00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:09,820
one of the to be a between developers

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,549
community and there was a blog post from

00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,990
your Kaplan talented young today about

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:19,929
this but that's really something that

00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:22,900
family we should try to improve Susan's

00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:24,900
threads so external things has the

00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,340
perception the growing perception that

00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,380
distributions are solved problems and we

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,880
are we are not cool anymore and all the

00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,620
cool kids are doing something else at

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,690
working in distributions but probably

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,940
wasn't the case ten years ago I think

00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,650
that we have a lot of things to do as

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:41,200
with tribution lots of interesting

00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,179
problems to solve and schedule at the

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,200
con shows a lot of things that just

00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:49,600
distribution can contribute to solving

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,210
but still that's us and we need to be to

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,570
communicate this to the rest of the

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,020
world

00:32:52,570 --> 00:33:01,929
so that we have addressed the old guys

00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:05,230
that do all the boring stuff the require

00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:07,330
skills to work on debian actually quite

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:11,980
rare and not typically not too

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:14,410
in typical university curriculums if you

00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:17,710
look at the projects doing web

00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,450
development for example every student in

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,820
computer science knows about web

00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,980
development what's required in the

00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:26,559
beyond for to contribute to Debian is a

00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:29,110
bit unclear actually it's a width of

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,760
development skills is admin skills will

00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:36,400
give system's skills and that's

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,730
something that is not taught anymore at

00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,010
universities and it makes it much more

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,710
difficult for us to recruit students for

00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:47,890
programs like jihad or to recruit new

00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:49,870
contributors and actually when so maybe

00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:53,410
you know about gift bags so the name is

00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:55,030
not quite good but the idea was to tag

00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,340
dogs that are suitable for new

00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:00,850
contributors and the very few perks

00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:03,790
tagged like that very few don't know

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:06,460
about those bugs between fixed probably

00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:10,179
because we have problems identifying

00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:16,179
what what's the level of skills expected

00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:17,889
from new contributors that's also an

00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,940
increasing competition with emerging

00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:24,639
language specific packaging solutions I

00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:27,040
can't think of a scripting language or

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,080
the higher level language right now is a

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,080
doesn't have its own packaging solution

00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:40,720
maybe not a scale but that's that's the

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,429
kind of kind of a failure for debian I'm

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,810
not having or for distribution is right

00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:49,119
in general not having been able to

00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:55,720
impose Debian packages as a de facto

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:58,750
standard so as I said I wanted to live

00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,609
rather space for description today the

00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:05,670
slides are available here to make it

00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:05,670
easier to discuss I will just copy paste

00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:14,440
the just slice okay that are going to be

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,190
the most discussed probably on go be so

00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,700
has a copy document in the italic hold

00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,700
subdirectory and

00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:15,840
so yeah it's not about that so yeah I

00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,700
think I think that's a threat was a

00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:22,140
clearly a threat for the priests of the

00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:25,980
community I'm not sure if he on has so

00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:32,460
much to contribute to solving this as a

00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:34,710
distribution one so well probably has

00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,020
some improvement to be done in making it

00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,130
easier for users to install software so

00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:43,280
they can run with their own

00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:46,740
infrastructure their own web services

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,400
that's not something that we have not

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:52,109
been able to do while public yeah with

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,090
people to work on the web applications

00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:58,320
packaging updated policy on web

00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:02,030
application the current one based on

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:07,859
what ten years ago is totally probably

00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:11,480
unsuitable to recent web applications we

00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:14,010
need to fix that problem before I think

00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,320
going further in that area that's the

00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,890
problem that we know as existed for a

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,890
long time

00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,000
I just wanted to pick up on that comment

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,830
you made about that convent the um you

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,780
know show of hands about travel

00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:34,810
sponsorship and just wanted to say that

00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,880
we're very well aware of this and we

00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:38,440
would like to spend more money on travel

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,630
sponsorship and get more people involved

00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,040
if they can if they have the time in the

00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,600
past it's always been a little bit of a

00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,480
time constraint and this year actually

00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,950
we had more money set aside than was

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,070
actually claimed so we got some money

00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:53,770
back this means two things first of all

00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:55,690
I think we should start a little earlier

00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:58,420
and we are on that so that it's easier

00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:01,630
to plan your time and and get the

00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,640
vacation improved and second we also

00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,470
need to encourage people that as a

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,480
matter of fact your participation is

00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:09,850
important and we will help you do it and

00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,780
that's the job for all of you guys and

00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,780
we'll work on the rest

00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,410
so one of the things you listed as a

00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,670
threat the idea that the packaging

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,339
skills are a combination of this

00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:29,829
administration and development skills um

00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:32,950
given that I just had a giant argument

00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:34,990
with that with the previous employer the

00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:37,930
I one of things I want to call out there

00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,880
is that we have an opportunity in being

00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,250
clear about what we do inside Debian I

00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,039
think to attract a lot more people by

00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,660
making by making the point that the

00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,549
things that you do in Debian is part of

00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,650
building a packages actually DevOps

00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:52,180
skills so that combination of

00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,069
development plus this administration is

00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,930
something that the industry has been

00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:57,309
fighting about four years and the DevOps

00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,260
camp that says that you should do both

00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:01,289
of those things together in one team

00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:05,770
with one set of people is mostly winning

00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:07,089
and if we can point out that and I tried

00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,640
to point this out at my talk about

00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:13,210
Enterprises administration and in for

00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,250
Debian in New York that those really

00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,109
that the skills that you do as Debian

00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,880
packaging our DevOps skills our

00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:21,460
Enterprises administration skills and

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,950
vice versa anyone who can do devops can

00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:26,049
do Debian packaging that might be an

00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:29,770
opportunity for us to get more attention

00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:31,990
and more attract more contributors and

00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:34,470
make it look cooler to address one of

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,470
the other points

00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:52,180
on spending money on spending money I'd

00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:56,880
like to see that

00:39:52,180 --> 00:40:00,490
LW and the editors at DEFCON 15 also the

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,200
package specific language specific

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,630
packet managers I see that as an

00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,360
opportunity rather than a threat because

00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:11,130
it means that we can develop tools to

00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,130
easily turn those into Devon packages

00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:28,330
so I like to hear from the people who

00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:30,920
did not support the idea of goodies for

00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:32,950
actually you I draw the combination as

00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,950
well

00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:52,369
yep okay I was just gonna point out that

00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:54,799
if we do buy cryptographic smart cards

00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:59,329
that does violate the keyring teams

00:40:54,799 --> 00:41:03,579
requirement of for K keys because as far

00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:03,579
as I know the maximum yeah

00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,960
turn around okay

00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:50,869
my understanding is first of all that

00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,269
you can convince the urban Beach B cars

00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:55,190
to do four kaykai's there's a trick to

00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:57,140
it where you tell it generate a fork a

00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:00,859
key and then it realizes it can and it's

00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:02,630
all good two K's he's only in

00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:04,759
exceptional circumstances proved to me

00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,920
it's a good idea otherwise for keiki so

00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:09,529
do the trick on the card to get a fork a

00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,359
key my concern about traffic smart

00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:13,250
parts is we order a thousand

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,990
cryptographic smart cards and then all

00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,000
of a sudden what do I do

00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,160
let's see I'll Trojan a thousand

00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,920
cryptographic smart cards for Debian I'm

00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,859
not sure to reliable distribution for it

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,660
I think it would certainly help in many

00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:28,130
ways but but there are complicated

00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,700
things which is much more than just the

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:34,940
money around it that's why you see when

00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:39,259
on that's likely not going to work on

00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:41,779
that myself keeper can well if you

00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:46,279
figure out how to solve the technical

00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:49,099
issue and consider the money issued to

00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:51,470
be sort of my point that's not work

00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:53,720
you're going to be learn to be done for

00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:56,090
nothing we can buy them

00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,540
the technical side we are fine I will

00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,540
find them

00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:05,420
thank you tough times

00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,680
yes thank you very much many times

00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,680
