	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
this talk is not really about any

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,779
particular technology in Debian it's

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,790
actually you talk about how Debian

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,139
changed my life which seems like

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,049
something that people here might be

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:16,859
interested in so I'm here to tell my

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,640
story thanks for coming so I'm gonna

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,650
start from the beginning

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,560
I was born here in Scarborough Ontario

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:28,710
on a street that looked like this

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,489
yay Canada it's kind of like the suburbs

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,649
of Toronto you could walk down my street

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:35,309
and you'd look out over the Scarborough

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,640
Bluffs

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,649
and it looked like this you know snow

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,340
for about eight months of the year but

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,860
otherwise incredibly beautiful but I

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,870
didn't actually stay in Canada that long

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,620
so when I was about three and a half

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:56,309
years old my family moved to upstate New

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,789
York because my dad he got a better job

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,640
and I think he was kind of like always

00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:04,500
interested and like excited about the

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,450
American dream basically he wanted to

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,960
move to the u.s. to you know be an

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:14,159
American so you know when I was three

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,409
and a half we moved to this house in

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,189
Camillus New York which is a suburb of

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:23,659
Syracuse New York and it's generally an

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:26,460
incredibly boring little suburban town

00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:29,880
so I grew up being a pretty nerdy kid

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,560
and I also spent a lot of time at this

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,470
place I'd like to call the farm which

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,380
was actually in Canada my grandma lived

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,630
here and I would run around on the farm

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,299
and do lots of farm things and generally

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,439
be kind of like a dirty you know farm

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,180
kid getting getting dirty in the mud and

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,750
I was also a huge nerd so I like read a

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,009
ton of books voracious reader when I was

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,500
really young

00:01:53,009 --> 00:02:00,180
and this is the middle school that I

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,439
went to it was in a cornfield extremely

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,439
extremely interesting

00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,490
but I was also actually pretty active

00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,670
little kid I like to run a lot I

00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:15,520
actually ran cross-country which is like

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,970
trail running in middle school and also

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,890
I ran track and field this must not have

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:27,040
been a good day and this is a high

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:31,960
school I went to and the high school I

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,120
also I was also like a music geek and I

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,750
played the French horn for 10 years so

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:41,380
growing up like this was a huge creative

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,940
outlet for me I was like in the band and

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,850
I also played trumpet in the jazz band

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:50,200
and then in high school actually gave up

00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:52,140
cross-country in order to do this so my

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,960
high school I had a pretty well-known

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,660
high school marching band so if you're

00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,910
not familiar with a marching band this

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,770
is a particular kind of marching band

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,170
that's like not it's not like parade

00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,560
band we didn't march in parades but what

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:11,560
we did do was we had this like

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,320
eight-minute choreographed show that we

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,500
would do on football fields so you'd

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,090
play it like the halftime game at home

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,730
football games and then there's also

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:25,209
like this competition circuit and this

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:30,910
is actually um kind of like the state

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:32,350
finals at the Syracuse dome and the show

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,930
this year was based on this prog rock

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:39,010
band called yes so we were like you know

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:41,500
make these like formations and walk

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:46,150
around and play music and it was really

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,340
fun but during this whole time while I

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,880
was like growing up in a cornfield and

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,830
playing music and reading books

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,520
eventually I discovered computers and I

00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:00,250
guess this was about mostly around

00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,440
middle school I would say so I got into

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:13,810
computers through games and I have like

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:15,460
really entire summer everybody and one

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,600
of the things that I found in games was

00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,600
escape so

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,660
the town that I grew up on was super

00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:25,240
boring and I kind of like look to

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,600
computers for adventure so I really

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,490
liked games that gave me the ability to

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,990
kind of like explore new worlds and

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,470
didn't necessarily have like linear

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:38,850
storylines but like this is a Wing

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,720
Commander privateer which I loved and

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,010
one of the things I really liked about

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,200
it was that you didn't have to follow

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,750
the storyline if you didn't want to you

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,030
could just like go around and like run

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:52,810
missions and make a lot of money and

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,460
like upgrade your ship and you could do

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,610
the story if you wanted but you didn't

00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,250
have to so my gaming experience was

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,800
really driven by this desire to like

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:08,280
explore new worlds and control my own

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:11,530
experience and this is my room in

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,700
probably about seventh grade I had this

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:19,240
uh this like compact desktop machine

00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,610
that I think we got at some like like PC

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,280
when I was at like big-box store that

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,840
was popular in the early 2000s Circuit

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,770
City yeah I think it was from Circuit

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,480
City and you actually see that am i

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,550
running Windows XP on this so this is

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,830
before the W in days

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,320
and I was also like a huge soccer player

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:42,280
you can see my like soccer team photos

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:45,910
and I hate to admit this but I also had

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:52,630
this obsession with horses which you

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:58,030
might notice from the decor so back to

00:05:52,630 --> 00:06:00,690
gaming my gaming experience which I

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,670
which I said was driven by this like

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:07,690
desire for exploration eventually led me

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,980
to get involved in these online text

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,670
based games called muds

00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:16,060
and in particular I was like it was one

00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,950
day and like ninth or 10th grade after

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,230
marching Madden attended emerging wind

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:23,620
takes up a lot of time so I had

00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:26,740
practices basically like three days a

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,900
week for like three hours at a time plus

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,030
weekend competitions so in marching band

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,580
let out like my life was

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:39,160
d and like I had nothing to do except

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:43,350
for school and surf the Internet so he

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,390
was like after what I'm doing us and

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:51,670
though you actually just like therapy

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:55,600
terminal and log into the mud server via

00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:57,640
telnet and so this is like the login

00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,650
screen for shadows official door was

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,210
which was this month that I got into and

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,520
it was a particular kind of mud in that

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,860
it was what's called like our

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,669
role-playing intensive mud so like

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:15,370
people would form these characters and

00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:16,750
put a lot of story into them this is a

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,500
character that I played on this mud for

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,690
like three years and people would put a

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,660
lot of effort into like painting the

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,580
stories behind their characters so I

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,010
have like text files and text files that

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:34,210
are like my characters life story and

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:36,310
like a description of her like important

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,990
events in her life people she news that

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,610
I could like reference that when I was

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:44,380
playing in the game and make sure that I

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,610
was staying in character and I think

00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,200
this character was very much a

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:53,260
representation of like my like want for

00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,090
adventure and like kind of like being

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,220
the good kid at school and not wanting

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,360
to be the good kid online so I played

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,240
this character had this like kind of

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,560
sordid past and kind of got up to no

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,240
good and hadn't got into some trouble

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,350
but I got so into this game that I

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:14,410
actually started helping run it and then

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:18,820
this was my administrator kind of like

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:23,080
persona on the game she was um and Norse

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:25,780
God my family is Norwegian by the way

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,020
this was also a major part of my

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,000
upbringing so I had this like alter-ego

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,060
kind of at school where people will call

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,039
me Viking and like I read use this as an

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,839
excuse to like do silly silly things

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,370
where people would think I was tough but

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,969
they're the hottest chemo online was my

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,980
administrator persona

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,329
and one things that administrators

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,120
could do in the game was like you could

00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:50,620
build your own like personal room so

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,660
like when I when I logged into the game

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,610
I would spawn in this room the Great

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,199
Hall of Valhalla and like you would

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,750
build these rooms and like you could

00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:00,430
make objects so like there were

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,320
facilities in the game for you just to

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,149
like you know write the descriptions for

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,800
all these objects and then like the

00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:08,910
purpose of the administrators on the

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,199
game was actually to like run plots and

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,990
kind of like keep this story going

00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:17,199
because this particular game was

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,940
incredibly story driven and you know as

00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:22,329
the text-based game so that's kind of

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:26,440
all that you had and actually like on

00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:29,649
this game if you died if your character

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,360
died your character was dead so this

00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,540
gave an incredible amount of weight to

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:39,850
kind of actions and lines that were

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:43,959
going on in this story but this was kind

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:46,779
of like the first the first time I

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:49,870
actually like found people that I really

00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,310
connected with and I made like really

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,170
good friends with some of the other

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,149
people that ran this game though they

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,290
like lived you know across the country

00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:58,720
there was this one guy who lived in

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,240
Missouri that I I really took to and

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,649
like he was about the same age as me and

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,260
like most of the other administrators

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,720
were older so like you know we talked

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,600
about life and like I got into like punk

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:16,029
rock and got to like talk to this guy

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:21,279
and I think that having this outlet for

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:23,019
like weirdos and nerds was a really huge

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,430
part in me like feeling and comfortable

00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:29,560
enough of my own skin to like make

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:33,610
friends and realize such as these so I

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,430
went on this program when I was 15 where

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,560
I went to the Bay Area for like a week

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,839
and was doing like science nerd things

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,750
and I actually was like so into this

00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,579
game that I met up with the person who

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,780
wrote it while I was on this trip I

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:51,890
didn't tell my parents by the way

00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:54,800
meeting people from the internet I'm 15

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,900
years old but he's actually like totally

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,680
cool nice guy and like probably thought

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,910
I was totally crazy a little fan kid but

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,380
he was going to like the University of

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,360
Santa Clara at the time I was studying

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,680
to be a lawyer and actually think that

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,020
meeting this guy in real life kind of

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,760
like shattered my like Methos of the

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:16,010
creator of this game a little bit but he

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,420
lives in Seattle now and I have like an

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,930
open invitation to like grab yours with

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:23,270
him so that's all and I also made

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,870
friends in real life and I kind of found

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:30,590
all the weirdos at my school after

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,540
having been able to like figure out how

00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,360
to express myself by meeting people

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,610
online and the friends that I made at

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,320
school we did crazy things like dressed

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,600
up as the Spanish Inquisition for

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,070
Halloween and we would like go to all

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,770
the different classrooms at my high

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:53,480
school and like burst into the classroom

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:55,190
time I was really I was really into

00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:05,810
running this game but it turns out if

00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:08,720
you that the game was what you do so I

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:11,660
want to take in my my my brother to help

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,730
me install Debian on that compact

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:19,940
machine that I saw you saw in the

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:23,089
previous slide and at the time installed

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:26,450
Debian Sarge it was testing at the time

00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:31,460
I think this is 2000 late at leat 2004

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:32,990
probably and that was kind of a pivotal

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,650
moment for me I started just like

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,660
running Debian all the time I never I've

00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,080
never run any Linux distro other than

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,080
Debian

00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:49,120
and it turns out that I'm like

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,850
incredibly enthusiastic about things and

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,360
curious and I couldn't really keep my

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,010
hands off of Debian in that like I was

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,899
curious about how it works like it's a

00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,910
pretty strange thing like there's a

00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:02,890
thousand people all around the world

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,630
that like somehow managed to create this

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,529
like software that will run my computer

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,570
that's pretty amazing and so I was

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:13,420
curious I was like fifteen years old and

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,190
you know I want to learn more and so

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,829
like I started kind of like lurking

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,769
around like subscribe did probably that

00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:23,290
mean eval and started reading Planet

00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:26,800
Debian and um

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:31,390
one day I was reading Planet Debian and

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,850
this blog post was on Planet Debian it's

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:39,760
a blog post written by Hannah Wallach

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:44,140
who I bet a bunch of you know and right

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:48,220
around this time was a time when Debian

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:50,860
was really interested in increasing its

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,779
diversity and this organization had

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,839
popped up called Debian women which was

00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:58,360
founded by Hannah and Erin Clark and a

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,760
few other people and so Hannah wrote

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,120
this this blog post talking about Debian

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,220
women on Planet Debian and when I read

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,140
this blog post I was like holy

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:14,440
these people want me to like contribute

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:18,250
so that's pretty pretty much tent life

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:21,390
like I I started getting on IRC and I

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:24,100
met a bunch of these people on IRC and

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:29,370
kind of started like funneling my energy

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:32,680
away from the game and into Debian so

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,660
this is like two days after I read that

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,520
blog post I wrote my own like I had this

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,459
blog that I was running on a sub-domain

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,380
of middle-earth the US which was the

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:44,560
game site because you know I was fifteen

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,970
years old and didn't have a server so

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,230
that was like the way I had a publishing

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,500
platform on the web and I had this

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,959
WordPress blog and I was like really

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,240
excited so I wrote this response blog

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,850
post which described

00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:04,089
in my own words at the time like how I

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:06,160
felt so I like started learning to

00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:09,369
package and I started learning Python

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,869
and Christian Perrier who's another

00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:13,149
Debian developer kind of like took me

00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:15,209
under his wing and like I helped out

00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:17,379
with the shadow team which you know

00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:19,600
packages some kind of important

00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:24,490
utilities and that made me feel really

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:28,389
important and everyone was just like

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:35,350
super friendly and encouraging and I

00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:36,999
wanted to stay so I did so this is me

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,689
wearing a Debbie and women t-shirt that

00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:43,629
I had to like awkwardly asked my mother

00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:46,480
for money to buy because like I think it

00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:48,759
was like Steve McIntyre that had been

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,889
the person who instigated Debbie room

00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,869
and t-shirts and he lived in the UK and

00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:55,809
like I was in upstate New York and like

00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:57,610
had to like Pam dollars so he could send

00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:00,069
me a t-shirt and my mother was just like

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:10,059
I don't know whatever sure you can have

00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:16,559
some money what are you doing but I was

00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:20,740
hooked and I was sixteen years old so

00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:24,369
this is actually a quote from my college

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:27,639
applications which describes what

00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:28,569
happened after that in my college

00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:31,619
applications

00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:38,189
I pretty much I talked about two things

00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:38,189
one was marching band and two was Debian

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,910
so I didn't really before that I hadn't

00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:48,129
really decided on like what I wanted to

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,720
do going forward I had kind of always

00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:51,339
had this sense growing up that I was

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,490
going to be an engineer I came from a

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:57,429
family of Engineers but like it's a very

00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,929
broad thing like engineering like I

00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:01,269
could have decided to be a mechanical

00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:03,790
engineer or a chemical engineer I'm like

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:07,020
ya know this software stuff stuff is

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:09,220
changing the world this is cool it's fun

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,569
so that really

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:18,939
changed the way I was thinking about

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:22,980
where her was going and this is Hannah

00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:27,370
Wallach and at the time I was applying

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,140
for colleges I had like via like my

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,809
involvement in free software and Debian

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:36,190
I kind of developed this like college

00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:39,970
crush on MIT but I was like too shy to

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:42,700
like I was like too unconfident I guess

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,230
to like apply there and select this one

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,850
day I was talking to Hannah Wallach on

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,440
Irish Sea and we were like you know

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,240
private messaging each other and I was

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,620
talking about college applications and I

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,169
was like I really kind of want to apply

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,750
to MIT but I don't know and she was just

00:17:53,169 --> 00:18:00,789
like super enthusiastic and I was like

00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:04,750
you should totally apply to MIT and so I

00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:07,120
did but I didn't tell anyone I really

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,640
didn't tell anyone I told my parents but

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,110
I didn't tell anyone at school and

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,909
because this other like smart kid at my

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,690
school had applied to Harvard and like

00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:18,730
everyday all the other kids would see

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,909
him and be like did you get into Harvard

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,309
yet did you get into Harvard yet and

00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:31,600
like I just didn't want to get harassed

00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:38,770
about it so I didn't tell anybody but I

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:41,980
got in it was like I never expected that

00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:43,750
to happen and it was incredibly exciting

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,520
like from the minute I got my acceptance

00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,049
letter which actually had like a

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,750
handwritten note on it from the

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:52,090
admissions officer talking about I had

00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:56,890
basically waxed about like free software

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:59,020
and Debian hacking in my essays and like

00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,059
the admissions person like wrote um my

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,950
acceptance letter that he thought that I

00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:08,080
would really fit in at MIT because of

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:10,600
like my interest in like free software

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:18,730
and open-source and I kind of like

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:22,090
hacker culture so I was sold and so I

00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,049
visited MIT in April of 2006 they have

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,330
this like preview week

00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:28,450
where you know prospective students come

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,779
and check out the campus and they like

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:36,190
put you up with a current student and so

00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:38,830
I did that and I was staying on in this

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:41,230
dorm called East Campus and it looks

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:45,610
like this there's actually a photo from

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:48,309
my my visit and visiting a mighty kind

00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:50,080
of blew my mind like here's like a bunch

00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:55,239
of nerds like sitting around in this

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:58,059
like super like kind of grungy dorm with

00:19:55,239 --> 00:20:01,330
like computers and like soldering

00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:02,739
equipment and like they they did some

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,239
crazy things while we were there like we

00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:07,059
were doing this thing where we like put

00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:08,919
ping-pong balls in a microwave that was

00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:11,889
a science microwave not for food use and

00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:15,489
it caught on fire and like they were

00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:19,299
like throwing old LCD monitors off the

00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:23,529
roof and like it was just crazy I don't

00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:27,460
know ai ai ai it kind of blew my mind

00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:31,450
and I was totally sold I was like these

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:35,499
are my people I'm coming here and during

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:38,710
this trip and I also like I had come a

00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:41,590
day early because I was taking the train

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:46,419
from upstate New York to Boston

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:48,519
and that meant that like I got there

00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:52,509
like the day before I actually had a

00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:54,639
host on campus so of course I emailed

00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:58,359
Debian Boston social and was like I need

00:20:54,639 --> 00:21:02,950
a place to stay on like Wednesday night

00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:05,109
and then Jamaica Hill responded to that

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:09,669
email and offered me to crash on his

00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:10,960
couch and his house is called the asset

00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:14,139
areum Sarah

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,359
I stood at the asset areum and this is

00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:20,679
my stuff on the floor the asset areum

00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:23,679
version 1.0 and I like threw a party for

00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,149
me it was amazing at least I assume the

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,060
party was for me it might have just have

00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:30,150
been a party

00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,150
[Music]

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,660
um and yeah so like I had started just

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,270
like meeting people from the internet in

00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:45,670
real life which I didn't tell my parents

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:47,920
about but on this trip another amazing

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,960
thing happened which was because I was

00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,540
staying with Maiko

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,390
he gave me the tour of the MIT Media Lab

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:58,780
which was where he worked at the time

00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:02,530
and on that tour I met this guy who was

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,360
like working in a lab and that guy just

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,330
happened to be looking for like hackers

00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,520
to like employ for this summer and so

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:12,840
like I go home and get an email from

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,490
this guy who's like do you want a job

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,890
because like make it would introduce me

00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,140
as like this like Debian hacker and so

00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:24,430
he's like wow awesome like high schooler

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:29,260
who is probably unemployed and I need

00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:30,700
some help so despite the fact that they

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,350
weren't gonna pay me very much and I was

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:36,550
gonna be like living alone in an

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:40,540
expensive city and I said yes because I

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:43,000
really wanted to get out of my town so I

00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:47,580
pretty much went from this which was a

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:54,280
Saturday in June of 2006 and on Monday

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:57,250
what was this on Sunday the day after I

00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,160
graduated my dad drove me to Cambridge

00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:02,380
Massachusetts in the family minivan

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:05,250
unloaded all of my stuff in my new

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:12,040
cambridge apartments and drove off he

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:14,670
left me there that same day so luckily I

00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:19,480
knew some people in Cambridge already

00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:23,530
and maeko and its partner Myka basically

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,910
adopted me for that summer so because I

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,680
didn't really know anyone I didn't know

00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,710
any students like all the other students

00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,540
my year weren't there yet I pretty much

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,640
spent my entire time hanging out with

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:38,170
Devon people that summer and make Omega

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,640
said me lots of delicious vegetarian

00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:44,730
food because

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:48,070
I had never cooked before in my life and

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:52,000
that was my social group we did things

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:53,470
like rode bicycles and they were kind

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,660
enough to introduce me to some actual

00:23:53,470 --> 00:24:03,430
MIT students there there's some in the

00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:05,290
middle of this picture and the sower

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,800
went on at the end of the summer I

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:11,800
actually like moved into MIT

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:15,100
this is East Campus which is the place

00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,090
where I lived my first year any campus

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,380
would do with this thing where they're

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,840
like build these giant crazy

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,000
contraptions and this was the thing that

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,910
they were calling Jesus the ride which

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,650
ended up being like a a giant cross that

00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,260
like had this counterweight on it and

00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,360
they were like strapped people to it and

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,070
like put them on the ground and then

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,010
like launch them and like you would like

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,930
go like up up up up up up up up up up

00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,860
until like your nose was like two feet

00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,750
from the ground and then the

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,280
counterweight was like carefully

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:48,010
calibrated to make sure that you're just

00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:52,210
like go back so I was pretty sold on

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:57,880
this as a place to live safety first

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:59,950
right and eventually ended up moving

00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,800
into this kind of crazy co-op on campus

00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:09,250
and broadening my skillset in hacking

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:15,100
such as in building bicycles building

00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:19,390
crazy contraptions in the basement yeah

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:23,400
this is a giant Tesla coil actually my

00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,400
involvement in this project was this

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:33,360
I was honestly quite terrified that we

00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:33,360
were gonna like blow up the entire house

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:41,529
also I got some crazy shenanigans with

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,590
fire might have been involved in putting

00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:48,399
some things on rooftops a different kind

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:53,409
of MIT hacking and you know like hacking

00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:54,010
on computers and generally my experience

00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:57,250
at MIT

00:25:54,010 --> 00:26:00,279
can be summed up in this picture it's a

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:05,799
very kind of like love-hate place it's

00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:09,279
super intense and I would definitely do

00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:11,260
it again but like I'm glad that has been

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,159
for years it might have taken me two

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:17,649
years to say that I would do it again

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:23,770
and this is another picture of how I

00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:27,820
experienced MIT no this is a room but

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:29,320
it's just like a sad selfie might have

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:34,169
been during some period of crushing

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:37,419
depression impending exams or something

00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:40,419
but well this stuff was happening MIT I

00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:42,250
was also still involved in Debian I

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:44,230
actually spent two summers like

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,809
traveling around Europe and I went to

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:51,179
DEFCON seven with my own money that I

00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:55,720
had earned with jobs that I had gotten

00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:58,480
via Debian actually like I worked at the

00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,270
like on campus like helpdesk

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,220
so like answering like UNIX help

00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:07,029
questions and like helping people with

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,830
computers and I also got this job at

00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:12,730
this company called best practical which

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:16,179
makes this thing called RT and the way I

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:18,399
got this job was like the owner of this

00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:21,250
company I had like heard of me and like

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:26,380
my like debian cred and like tracked me

00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:29,590
down and was like do you want a job and

00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,720
of course I said yes and he was so

00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,639
awesome to let me like run around and go

00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,360
to Europe during the summers while I was

00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:36,360
working for him

00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:45,410
and this is more dip com 7 Scotland is

00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:50,340
full of castles and David noosa now is

00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:51,180
apparently eyeing the camera and I kept

00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,910
going to Depp Kampf

00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:57,590
I went to deaf golf 9 and this is the

00:27:53,910 --> 00:28:03,780
t-shirt that best practical gave me a

00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:10,710
very apt t-shirt and this is me at Gua

00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:12,870
Tech in 2008 in Gran Canaria and MIT I

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,820
also got involved in this student group

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:18,420
that was called the student information

00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:21,330
processing board which is basically the

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,220
Computer Club at MIT except for it's so

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,950
old that they didn't call computing

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,870
computing when it was started it was

00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,560
actually like started to like manage the

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:35,670
time sharing on like this multics server

00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:38,280
and this organization is full of tons of

00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:42,810
hackers so obviously like I was drawn to

00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:45,510
it because of my experience in Debian

00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:47,910
and this student group did a lot of

00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:51,300
really cool things like they revamped

00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:54,600
the entire kind of like campus Linux

00:28:51,300 --> 00:29:01,130
distro I was there to be based on Debian

00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:04,200
actually and it still is to this day and

00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:10,530
my favorite class that I took at MIT was

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:14,340
the operating systems class which kind

00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:16,470
of changed my life in that I decided

00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,270
that I wanted to like do operating

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,000
systems research and I was like very

00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:23,970
close to going to grad school at MIT and

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,290
doing a master's with the parallel and

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,290
distributed operating systems group

00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:36,300
except for my spring of senior year I

00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:38,610
had been sponsoring packages for this

00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,830
guide Tim Abbott I was a friend of mine

00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,770
from Sippi he was like doing a whole

00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:46,080
bunch of work on I'm just like math

00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,880
software for that he was trying to

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,550
upload to Debian I was sponsoring his

00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,870
stuff and he just started this company

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:56,820
case place and so like this one time you

00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:59,430
emailed me asking for a sponsorship to

00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,830
upload a package and was also like hey

00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:06,060
we're looking for interns for I ap which

00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:12,090
is like this January Term at MIT like do

00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:16,740
you want a job so I started working for

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:20,310
K splice before I finished at MIT still

00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:22,740
intending to go to grad school but it

00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:24,060
turned out that at the end of my senior

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,270
year they just gave me a full-time offer

00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,710
and I was like uh I don't really want to

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:32,850
go to grad school I'd rather get a job

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:35,000
where they pay me so I started working

00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:38,100
for this company called key splice which

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,400
developed this technology that was

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,230
basically a kernel module for Linux that

00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,170
would allow you to like take a patch to

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:48,150
bellowing this kernel and you do those

00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:51,270
like binary differencing so that you

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:54,690
could then like load the the change card

00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:57,950
into memory and change your running

00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:01,020
kernel without having to restart it

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:06,480
which was pretty pretty novel at the

00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:08,280
time and you know I never interviewed

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,770
for this job it was just like I

00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:14,010
sponsored my friends Debian packages and

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:16,950
like they knew me from Sippy and you

00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:19,140
know I I demonstrated via my internship

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,800
there that I was like a good person to

00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:25,230
work with

00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:26,540
so ended up working there for like three

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,210
years

00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:32,550
the company was eventually sold to

00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,790
Oracle and that was a learning

00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,790
experience

00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,310
so at the end of like a year-and-a-half

00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:46,430
at Oracle I'd kind of decided that I was

00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:47,900
gonna leave eventually and I was trying

00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:52,070
to figure out what I wanted to do

00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:54,140
afterwards and decide that I was also

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,030
gonna leave Boston and this was like a

00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,770
big thing for me at the time because

00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,110
I've been living in Boston for seven

00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,300
years and it had been like the only

00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:05,180
place that I'd ever really lived as like

00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:08,780
an adult I was like I moved from upstate

00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,970
New York to Boston and I stayed there so

00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,470
like that's a part of my process for

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,410
like leaving Boston and I had this

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:17,270
whiteboard wall in my room and I like

00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,290
went through and just like listed all

00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:21,830
the things that I was gonna miss

00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:23,570
including like incredibly things that

00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,030
only you miss kind of like in us a

00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,100
nostalgic way like that potholes and

00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:30,110
like the snow and terrible weather and

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,840
you know how sweaty it gets in the

00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:34,280
summer there but you know I look back on

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,720
all those things right now I'm like damn

00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:41,630
I kind of miss it so I think writing

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,040
everything down was you know it was a

00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:49,400
good way to kind of let go and move on

00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:53,000
but I ended up moving to the Bay Area to

00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,970
Oakland and the reason I moved to the

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,670
Bay Area was to start this company with

00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:01,430
a friend of mine I've been talking to

00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:05,840
this friend for a long time actually met

00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:09,350
him a sophomore year at MIT he was like

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:14,020
a year behind me and he had been like

00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:16,640
trying to build stuff on top of email

00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:20,630
for his like undergraduate thesis so

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,190
like you know we often like take email

00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:25,100
and try to do things on top of it like

00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,750
you know run a bug tracking system not

00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,920
that I know anyone here that has done

00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,480
that and kind of found that he spent

00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,990
like all of his time just like trying to

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,120
work with email and so he decided that

00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,700
like someone had to like make the kind

00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,650
of like bottom level tools better before

00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:47,630
we could like write anything interesting

00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:49,120
that actually uses email so I was pretty

00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,920
sold on the idea

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,360
and I excited about working with him so

00:33:50,920 --> 00:34:00,670
I I moved to the Bay Area and this is us

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,260
back at MIT in last fall I guess pulling

00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,320
and extremely ill advised all nighter

00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,150
before he was giving a talk this was

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,639
actually in one of the Athena clusters

00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:12,040
at MIT and like we had gone to like the

00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,530
campus convenience store and bought a

00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,200
bunch of snacks and like I'm never doing

00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,100
this ever again but it was a thing at

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,620
the time

00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,790
and the talk was fine except probably

00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,790
would have been better if we had slept

00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:35,950
and this is like a little bit of an

00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:38,590
excerpt from our website and this is an

00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:40,240
example of things that you can do with

00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:45,070
inbox which is this company that I

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:47,889
started we actually the way that we've

00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:50,919
been going about that company has also

00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:53,350
been really influenced by my experience

00:34:50,919 --> 00:35:03,220
in Debian like for example when we

00:34:53,350 --> 00:35:05,200
released our code as a GPL which I I

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:08,500
wouldn't I would never even know and

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:13,420
that existed without my experience in

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:15,850
Debian and free software so yeah this is

00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,350
an example of like using our API we kind

00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,360
of like provide this like higher level

00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,980
API for interacting with email that like

00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,490
gives you threads across all providers

00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:27,250
not just Gmail like allows you to easily

00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:30,520
mark things as read and archive and this

00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:33,910
is like tags based API and we do that

00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:39,760
across all providers like you know even

00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:43,750
your dovecot installation so we're kind

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,490
of trying to evolve email from the

00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,690
inside out by making something that's

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,920
compatible with what we already have and

00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:56,860
I'm pretty excited about where that's

00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:58,920
going but the main reason I wanted to

00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:03,040
give this talk was to say thank you

00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,440
because I wouldn't be Who I am without

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:11,370
the amazing community that is Debian sir

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,370
oh thanks for doing what you do

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:22,820
