all right here we go my name is

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,300
Alexandra gates I work for the open

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,269
source technology center at Intel

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,410
Corporation being with Intel for about

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:19,800
six years and in my time off I do

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:31,859
triathlons and for work I do power

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:34,530
management on the Linux kernel oh and I

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,540
forgot to introduce my talk so you're

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,160
going to talk about cases study and

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,710
basically the way that this came about

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,950
is I thought well how is that - kernel

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,360
doing in terms of power management and

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,090
in relationship of the different

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:57,360
distributions without out out there so I

00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:00,000
took first boon to daily home working

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,000
with Debian and the idea is that I go

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,830
from distribution to distribution doing

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,700
a similar thing that you're gonna see

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:12,360
today so before we begin I would like to

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:16,860
see how many people here used any sort

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:21,420
of power management tool to turn your

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:25,860
computer okay very nice

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:30,270
how many of you use power top great

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,369
awesome good I went to a talk earlier

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,860
the other day and they were like three

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:44,189
people so this is good right so the

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:47,850
experiment of course I use Debian 314 a

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:52,500
Debian has its own kernel so in this

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:56,759
case I use 314 the 13 de to which it was

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,130
it came with the distribution for Jessie

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,030
is then the code name that you give it

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:06,780
and then I took the OP string kernel and

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:11,700
then slap it on on the system and this

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,590
is the latest is 316 that one I also

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,410
made some experiments as I mentioned

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,420
we're with Ubuntu 3 that 10 which they

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,940
come with their own distribution but I'm

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,510
not gonna come here and tell you all the

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:28,500
things about Ubuntu I'm just going to

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:30,060
talk to you about a 1-2-3 16.1 in the

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,400
stock and then of course everything and

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,849
also Debian in those two kernels that

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,890
you see up there for the experiments I

00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:49,440
use a really cool machine this is a Sony

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:51,390
Vaio pro 3 is 13 inches wide and the

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,700
best part about this computer is it's

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,579
super light and it's battery-powered

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,849
lasts about 6 hours and 30 minutes they

00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:01,709
claim but I've made it last a little

00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:05,010
longer so if you like to take a look at

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,810
pass it around and I love it I really

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:11,099
really like that computer it has

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:14,040
touchscreen it has a really nice Mouse

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:16,769
track bottles and it seems pretty

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,720
responsive and in terms of powered it

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:23,819
seems to do very well it has a husband

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:28,190
LT Core i5 4200 you and it has a hundred

00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,190
twenty eight gigabyte SSD right

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,829
pretty cool computer if you are looking

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,950
for a system to purchase and also this

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,400
one is the computer of choice of leanest

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,370
herballs

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,139
so yet another reason why I wanted to

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,139
see how did it do in terms of power

00:03:52,710 --> 00:04:04,350
I additionally to that I use Yokogawa WT

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:09,120
310 this is a power meter and I also use

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:14,880
a photometer to gauge the brightness of

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:19,170
the screen I use power table and all my

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:22,200
tests are 10 minutes intervals I'm

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:27,900
measuring both power suspend power

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,550
management idle power and of course I

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,660
have to make sure that my battery is

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,340
fully charged I did the mistake that at

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,800
the beginning I was taking this test and

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,890
the battery was in charge I my numbers

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:47,040
were going to the 20 watts range and of

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:51,570
course I was freaking out so about the

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:57,540
results well no animals were harmed in

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:59,550
this heinous experiment I have to give

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,400
kudos to Debian because they did a

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,260
really good job it seems that they are

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,650
pretty proactive occupying power top

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,910
updated every time there is a release I

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,950
have noticed with the other

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,300
distributions I've installed they

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:19,770
usually have a very old version of power

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:23,220
top so kudos to them for that so we're

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,020
going to talk about in the graphs that

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:31,170
I'm going to show you we're gonna have

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:33,000
on the on the x-axis what and then we

00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:37,970
are going to have x and of course it's

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,230
10 minutes of mentioned before and so

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:44,670
before we go into the having to what

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:48,750
this graph means I took two tests very

00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:51,960
simple tests one is a screen on Idol and

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,450
the other one is the screen of Idol and

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,170
the reason why I took those tests to

00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:03,150
begin with is because if you think about

00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:05,940
it probably 80 percent or 60 percent of

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,289
the time your computer is idle doing sit

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,229
in the

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:11,330
doing nothing and most of the times you

00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:13,460
are like on your desk talking on the

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,110
phone or something and the computer is

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,839
going to go to asleep and you even go

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,059
and touch the touchscreen so that it

00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,719
doesn't actually go to asleep and I

00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:27,349
sometimes do that so that's what I saw

00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:39,259
this is the most part where the computer

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:42,169
lays right so here in this graph we

00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,580
thought I took about out of the box

00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:46,999
there again on that computer that I'm

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:53,509
showing you I just installed a Jessie

00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:56,330
distribution and they up and the lower

00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:59,330
blue line is the screen of Idol and so

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:03,159
what I did in here is I only change the

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:05,629
brightness of the computer so if you

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,899
look into all these computers that come

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,969
out of the shop of this store they come

00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:12,769
with a very bright screen and they do it

00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:15,139
so that it looks very from the screen

00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:17,839
and and all that is great and nice but

00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,249
it turns out that when you are working

00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,809
you actually don't need all that

00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:24,830
brightness and you are children you know

00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:28,039
no that was for your eyes either so the

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,349
people from the panel the panel good

00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:37,669
they say that is actually good to have

00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:40,580
your screen in 200 needs and 200 needs

00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:44,419
is just like an arbitral I'm sorry 200

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:47,089
lumens and this is a number where you

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,759
can't see the screen and you can work

00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:52,249
and it looks bright and it's very very

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,860
nice and comfortable for you to just do

00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:57,110
your work so that's it with the

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,749
photometer I went on and look what was

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,419
there what was the two hundred elements

00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:05,119
there and it turns out that in order to

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:07,669
change my lumens I need to go and change

00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,669
my needs on my cyst on my system and I

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:13,789
do that by changing sysclass backlight

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:16,639
and sometimes if like in instance in

00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:19,180
this computer we have Intel GPU so we

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,180
have Intel back and brightness

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,300
there are some Sun use that and so then

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,259
you are going to have a CPI taking that

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,970
for you or the driver that comes with

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:35,020
and then of course brightness and so in

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:36,969
here I put it into 36 but the one thing

00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,620
that I want you to take away from here

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,539
is that don't go to your computer the

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,880
stuff in 36 in there because it's not

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,209
going to work chances big chances is

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,399
that just look what is the current

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:51,100
number that you have and usually I just

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,380
have it put it in half and then add that

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,310
number if it is bright or if it's too

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,040
dark

00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:01,209
well then just adjust that as as you

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,820
feel it it works for you but the thing

00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:08,380
in here is the idea to take away out of

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:15,160
this light is by only doing this I I am

00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:17,140
saving about 50 54 minutes of power but

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,649
only use keeping my screen a little

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:24,130
darker on the six hours that I have of

00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:29,310
battery so that's a pretty good savings

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,310
if if you think about in the long run so

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:38,290
until the previous slide it in your

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:41,170
imagination on how much power your panel

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,420
takes I put together these as like and

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,839
this is basically a pie chart that is

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:49,990
showing me in the system how much my

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:54,700
panel consumes and as you can see here

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:57,970
is 81 percent the second citizen that

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,130
uses more power is the CPU and one can

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,890
argue that one can tune the CPU to make

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,950
it let useless power but lack T of our

00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:09,640
panels are the big consumer so just skip

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:12,900
that press it when you use your systems

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,900
and you took them for power

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:30,450
so that's the next step I did is I took

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:35,380
the system and I install Linux kernel

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:38,200
3.16 that one and in again I did there

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,600
to test a screen on and a screen off

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,960
both idle screen on idle and its turn

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:51,340
off idle for 10 minutes I mean here I

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:53,890
found that my screen on idle and I'll

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,500
wait and say and then after that I drop

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,390
our top and then after running power top

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,360
I figured out that I saved with the

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:06,070
screen on idle 1 hour and 45 minutes and

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:09,850
then I also save 3 hours on a screen of

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:13,840
idle so that I use a lot of battery time

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:15,640
and if you are like in an airplane many

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,700
of you did that to come here to this

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,190
conference or traveling or in your house

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,610
or somebody's friend's house without

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:28,510
your battery charger 3 hours is going to

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:31,330
give you a lot of time to work right so

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:35,230
keep that in mind and this is also with

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:37,930
the change of the backlight so in here

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,450
I'm kind of stepping stones on the

00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:43,120
changes that I'm adding I'm no only one

00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:47,770
power table but I did I added my Linux

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:51,400
kernel I changed my bike light backlight

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:56,020
to make it less bright and then also

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,240
grunt power top so that was I thought

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,160
that was pretty neat that I said 1 hour

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,670
and 45 minutes and then it's going to

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,030
vial up Idol 3 hours that's about 48

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:13,240
percent of difference here in power

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:18,330
consumption that's very good now the

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:22,480
next is like I am comparing my

00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:24,940
out-of-the-box versus the kernel so the

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,030
previous life was dark computer with

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:31,300
fennel 3:16 but just by running power

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:35,050
top this one is the kernel the Debian

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,800
hot vs. 316 kernel and doing exactly the

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,699
same things

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,910
so in here I know I found out that my

00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:46,269
screen on I'm set in 2 hours and 24

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:48,129
minutes and in a screen of idle I saved

00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,709
the same amount of time and that's

00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:53,889
actually expected but it is suspected

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:57,910
because the new releases of the kernels

00:12:53,889 --> 00:13:00,069
should have more patches and since has

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,410
well is thoroughly a new platform there

00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:13,569
are patches that keep on going upstream

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:16,389
for that so that was nice so a lot of

00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:19,660
you use power top and in the different

00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:21,579
forums I found and even in the mailing

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,069
list I hear people that they don't know

00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:26,230
what what these numbers mean and how to

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:28,259
use it and how to analyze this data but

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,629
so we're gonna go a little bit about

00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:33,910
that data that you see on power top and

00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:36,509
also I'm going to tell you how this

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,920
computer did with a kid with a

00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:43,629
out-of-the-box kernel and with the

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:46,480
screen off so which in this in this

00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:49,540
screen we have process idle state report

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,290
and basically here is showing me what is

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:56,309
my processor doing when is doing when

00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:01,959
it's supposed to be doing nothing right

00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:06,459
the processor is partition in different

00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:11,459
models if you will and it has this this

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:12,819
particular processor has 4 CPUs it it is

00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:16,360
it

00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:18,879
there are grouped CPUs are group by twos

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,129
in this processor and they are group in

00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,069
course and of course there are two cores

00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:27,850
and then they are all group in a package

00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:30,669
and in the CPU the CPUs in the core they

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,019
share memory and interconnects and

00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:34,809
things and then in the package they

00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:39,299
share the buses and you probably know

00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:42,100
all these things better than I anyway so

00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:45,790
here the main idea that I want to show

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,589
you is that in the screen of idle when

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:52,459
it's not tuned my CP

00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:55,069
are rich in 98 percent on the deep-sea

00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:58,850
estates and if you're familiar with

00:14:55,069 --> 00:15:03,439
power management features of Haswell ult

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:08,389
they added different sea estates and a

00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:15,649
siesta it is basically a place I call it

00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:18,470
a place that the software goes and turns

00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:23,149
off certain things of the system so for

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:26,299
instance c0 is when the system is all

00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:31,869
fully up all the power is going through

00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:36,189
all the other systems see three to six

00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:39,709
the system is turning of Syrian buses

00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:42,579
and the c6 is turning of the memory

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:45,319
clashes in certain parts of the memory

00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:47,959
and then it keeps on going down until

00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:51,350
the memory is totally flush and turn off

00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,660
all the way to c10 and also the buses

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,939
and the lines and and it just goes down

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,209
turning after enough to minimize the

00:15:55,939 --> 00:16:02,299
amount of power of power that they use

00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:05,119
all the way to c10 so the other thing I

00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:09,109
notice here is that in my course I'm

00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:11,720
reaching c7 residency and that is good

00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:14,600
and on my EP you

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,179
I'm also reaching our c6 residency which

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,179
is good but if you notice on my package

00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:23,139
level all my numbers are on on c2

00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:25,939
residency and that is a problem because

00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:29,779
that means that the package is just not

00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:33,289
turning completely down today two days

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:38,419
to the idle state that is supposed to go

00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:41,859
and if I go and look into the tune after

00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:46,189
I run power tub and did all these things

00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:47,809
that turn down the screen color and all

00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:51,409
the things that I just explained I'm

00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:56,149
still in the same position where I only

00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:58,220
have my package level 90 99.9% in situ

00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:01,340
residency and the rest of my see my

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,710
tipsy estates are not are and the

00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:09,140
have any percentage so that's a problem

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:12,440
and so I went on ask people around and

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:15,470
why would that be and it turns out the

00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:20,600
graphics driver usually in this cases

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:25,760
the bigger issues later on the graphics

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:30,650
driver on the sound drivers and the

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:33,650
third mm the fair resident is the

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,420
networking so those those usually those

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,250
three groups are the ones that have the

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:41,240
most problems in terms of power

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:45,970
management so I went and asked and I had

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:49,460
turns out that the Intel driver has

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:55,670
panels of refresh setting flag that I

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:59,810
can set when I start my canal and I had

00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:02,240
to do I had to set that and you're also

00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:07,340
there were a couple of other flags that

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm pointing right here at the PCIe ispm

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:14,900
force and in this ones I said that I

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,440
should go when I do my screen off I was

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:21,830
able to go and do c7 residency which is

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,820
good before it was tuned and then when I

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:28,670
went on oh well when I went and tuned my

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,010
machine I should have gotten c10

00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:34,370
residency and I didn't update this part

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:37,970
but the thing the the point in here is

00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:40,040
that I didn't get my c10 residence yes I

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,430
was supposed to get it so focus on the

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:46,490
left hand side and it should cetane or

00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:48,530
some sort of residency in there after

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:51,590
this tune after you run power talk after

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:54,140
you turn down your your things and you

00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:58,190
have this flag set on your channel to

00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,230
start up your your system so that I

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,410
thought that's a problem cuz this was

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,360
with channel 3 16.0 and so I again I

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,490
went back and asked the people what's

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,140
going on here we are having a

00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,380
progression sure enough we did have a

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,510
progression and the past was already

00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,970
uploaded into our

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:20,000
internal snap to be AB stream in the

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,470
next version of 3.16 that zero and there

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,380
is also another regression that I'm

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:28,910
working on and just the debugging at the

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,970
moment that it has to do with panel self

00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,860
refresh and it turns out that with the

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,350
panel seller refresh I noticed in this

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,990
computer I get a lot of flicker in a

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,580
screen with Colonel 3:16 that's hero and

00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,520
it's awful because you can definitely

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:48,980
it's just no use of the computer unless

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:53,110
you are on like a lower screen level so

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:56,710
they are working out those patches and I

00:19:53,110 --> 00:20:00,350
when I did this test we see in previous

00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:02,480
kernels and also Punto I didn't run in

00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:05,120
many issues I actually was able to reach

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,000
my city and residency by doing these

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,860
things that I'm explaining here so

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,610
that's something to take and those are

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:16,220
some easy steps that one can do and they

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:19,010
just don't take much time so another

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,320
thing that if it's not the kernel and if

00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,440
you are not sure what's going on then it

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,510
might be that your the software that you

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,230
have loaded on your computer it's just

00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:32,030
not behaving properly a place to go and

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:37,070
look into that it's power stop of course

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:40,310
and you can look into the amount of

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:44,230
weight caps that the system has part of

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:47,390
gives you a really nice list of of the

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,820
software processes that are taking a

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:52,370
most amount of of wake-ups and if you

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,830
take a look in here of course the Intel

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:58,280
graphics driver is listed in there

00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:59,810
so does that would be a way to point out

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,350
if you are the bug in this kind of

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:05,960
problems but if you are also the bag in

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,850
your driver you can come and touch your

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,090
driver with this and it should tell you

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:17,330
if you're being delinquent on the way

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:19,360
cups per second this is a nice short and

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,750
it's meant to be like that

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,970
another setting that power table has is

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:28,160
the ability to tell you what are the

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:31,190
device drivers and

00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:36,140
that are not tuned correct correctly for

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:39,140
power management and so if you go to the

00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:43,490
last step of power tub is consumables

00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:46,820
and in what part up shows you here in

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:50,120
the HTML form is it gives you the script

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,190
that you should run on your computer so

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,250
that you can tune that device for power

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,500
in terms of power management and so once

00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,770
you go and test that every one of them

00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,050
work you could only use run powers of

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:07,870
auto-tune every time you start your

00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:10,220
computer power table doesn't keep a

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:13,130
memory every time you restart your

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,460
computer of these things because this is

00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,980
we don't consider this is our job a part

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,890
of us a tool it's a tool more to help

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,350
you identify and get better usage of

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,570
your computer but we feel that will be

00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:29,330
more work of the distribution actually

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:33,890
than than us I feel the distributions

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:37,280
will be more should be more hands-on on

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:39,170
getting these systems to tune their

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,800
software on this on the systems or at

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:46,610
least on the more the more common

00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,410
systems that are out there so if you

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,870
have your Linux system and you were

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,790
tired of octo tune of tuning and every

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,880
time you just go ahead and put this into

00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:58,340
your startup script and that should do

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,860
it for you after you test every one of

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,680
them because at times that might break

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,870
your system so be be aware of that

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,000
yeah because so and it's not because

00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,620
power table but is because there are

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,870
these devices out there that I don't

00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,850
have really good drivers and when you go

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,680
and tune it in terms of power it turns

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:19,610
out that the device doesn't behave well

00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:22,000
so it ends up breaking your system so be

00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,000
careful

00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:33,090
well now hi these huh I didn't study on

00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:35,909
what other devices how the devices that

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:42,929
I plug into this computer behave like

00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:45,179
the mouse says the drive the USB card

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:47,759
I also took one of those memory cards

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,259
and it's leopard in there and I said you

00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,840
know that's the scenario that we usually

00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:54,299
have as users we just go upload our

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,700
pictures and then we forgot about our

00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:59,039
card that is still in there and we just

00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,989
take it everywhere with us until it's

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,629
the next time to go take pictures and we

00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:05,609
take it out again so in terms of power

00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:08,220
management and how those things affect

00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:12,869
our system and I think the mouse one is

00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:16,139
the most common and is I found it pretty

00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:18,779
cool I'm sorry well first we're going to

00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:21,029
talk about the background color so of

00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:24,119
course the screen is very important and

00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:28,559
as we already saw before it takes a lot

00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:33,779
of power right so in this in this

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:37,850
specific experiment I tested I was

00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:42,629
curious about how is they out of stock

00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:45,779
debian gradient screen which is pictured

00:24:42,629 --> 00:24:49,529
above in the screen how does it behave

00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:52,350
with respect with a solid color and I

00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:54,989
was thinking well maybe all I could test

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,909
all the different colors right if I'm

00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:59,489
very ambitious but that is only limited

00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:03,809
time I have so I pick white and black

00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:07,919
backgrounds to test and I wanted to do

00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:13,549
also RGB but again my time was of an

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:17,690
essence so in here I have my

00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:23,340
out-of-the-box debian and I compare that

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:26,279
against my debian when you was tuned and

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:29,340
I will be the two blue the light blue

00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:30,960
the light blue line is for the out of

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,950
the box that yin and the dark blue line

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,740
is for the debian after it's tuned and

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,520
you can see the big difference in terms

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,380
on how many

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,100
what you're saving here you're saving

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:52,790
about four four words only by you

00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:52,790
stoning your computer and that was about

00:25:53,180 --> 00:26:04,170
yeah four minutes it saves you there is

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:06,690
something wrong here anyways then I went

00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:09,780
and compared my out-of-the-box debian

00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:13,260
with my black background and it saves

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:16,950
you about for four hours and thirty

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:20,400
minutes of battery if you have a single

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:23,010
black or white background I actually win

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,170
a test both and they both approximate

00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:28,350
two four four and a half hours of

00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:31,740
battery savings if you just go into into

00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:33,660
from a gradient color to black one color

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:40,160
background and the reason for this is

00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:44,630
because the there is some of these is

00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:48,000
because the frame buffer compression and

00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:51,600
of course the GPU needs to work a little

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,440
hard to get these colors and these

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,740
colors of the the gradient process and

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,140
if you have only one color well then is

00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,900
much easier for the GPU the memory and

00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,460
all these things to get only the one

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,990
color presented throughout the whole

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:12,920
screen so that was actually pre

00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:17,700
interesting that by changing my

00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:19,740
background brightness and also my

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:24,300
background color to a solid color I'm

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:28,580
saving for hours and thirty minutes but

00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,580
that I think that's a big win

00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,740
the other thing was the mouse so I put

00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:46,799
in my mouth and I think the mouse is the

00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,980
most common case because a lot of people

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,860
uses in their computers those little

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:55,950
plugable my houses I use a regular Mouse

00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:00,860
that just has the hotel and your plug

00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:04,500
forever but it's very similar case and

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:07,080
basically I have my screen on and my

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,299
screen of idle and my screen on is like

00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,460
a reference of how they behave and then

00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:13,649
I have my mouse out of the box which is

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,690
the blue line which is very similar to

00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:17,220
my screen on it it is equal to

00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,750
incomparable so that means that your

00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,380
mouse is not really eating your battery

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,120
there are some mice out there that are

00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:27,149
criminals on this so we should be aware

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,299
of that and then and then I did my mouse

00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:33,960
on the 316 and you notice is still it's

00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:36,539
still good but then I did I'm tuned the

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,889
system by having the mouse connected and

00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:42,360
the difference was so great it is about

00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:45,090
two hours and twenty five minutes of

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,870
battery savings by having my mouse tuned

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:50,850
so if I can have my mother convenience

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:56,010
of using my mouse especially now with

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:58,289
this tracking thing is I forgot the name

00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,929
of it the panels the track panels that

00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:03,179
are so complicated to use special if you

00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:05,130
are no are used to it and you have the

00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,110
convenience of having your mouse you

00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,480
will have two more hours only if you

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:13,440
used to in your system that is big

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,570
savings and very nice and convenient so

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,039
highly recommend to tune your system

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:24,779
when you just any time now we're going

00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:27,870
to talk about other distributions and

00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:30,720
again I only have one two and Davian at

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:34,169
the moment to compare I will have all

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,019
the distributions through the time this

00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:39,720
has been about six months of work on on

00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,850
doing these presentations and the mode I

00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,279
do I know that I learned that I have to

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,260
of course go to the next new kernel and

00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:48,870
we take all my data in both

00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,539
distributions and then also just update

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:54,570
things and change and is visible

00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:58,379
in fun but it's a lot of time anyways in

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,759
here.we it was actually very nice and

00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:04,710
comparable

00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:06,570
I was pleasantly surprised but then one

00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,779
day I thought it was actually weird is

00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,350
that

00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:16,070
Ubuntu behaved a little bit better than

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:20,279
Debian within the screen on idle and

00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:23,249
this I use the one thing I did in this

00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:26,429
in this test to make it more like a

00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:28,440
common base I used Colonel 3:16 and I

00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:30,629
also use power top I make sure that my

00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,320
system was fully tuned in order to make

00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,299
this happen

00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,929
and the reason why I did this is because

00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:38,489
usually with the distributions com

00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:41,549
they cannot succumb within the

00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:43,679
distributions they have certain changes

00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:46,889
that are specific for that distribution

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,749
and they just have so many tweaks and

00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:51,419
things and so I think it would be more

00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:55,139
fair to compare apples to apples here so

00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:59,129
for the skin on Idol if you use Ubuntu

00:30:55,139 --> 00:31:02,220
you will have 19 more minutes of battery

00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:05,879
life and with the skin of Idol you have

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,919
11 more minutes it's small but I feel

00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:11,309
that is room for improvement in there in

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,190
the live in the Debian work and then

00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:16,710
chances are that in the next kernel

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,749
release things change I'm not sure what

00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:22,849
would be the variables here but in order

00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:25,619
to identify what makes this difference I

00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:29,820
feel one will have to go in a deep

00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:31,409
understanding on what what are the

00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,419
different components of the system and

00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:41,789
how they are behaving in terms of power

00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:46,889
of course ok so as you know there is a

00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:49,320
lot of room for improvement here again

00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:51,899
kudos to Debian to have power table to

00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:57,090
have the latest version of it installed

00:31:51,899 --> 00:32:04,340
but I also feel that the distributions

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:04,340
can do more aggressive approach to

00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:11,759
do better power management on the

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:15,399
systems that are out there we won't do

00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:17,830
for instance they are trying to be good

00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:20,350
class citizens and they have a place

00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:23,529
where they say these are the platforms

00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,269
that we badge for and they even have a

00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:28,149
website and they have a listing that of

00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:31,389
the systems it's very cool but I feel

00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:33,009
they could do a little more and and we

00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:37,749
all could do a little more right and

00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:41,259
what I mean by that is like for instance

00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:43,090
I show you there were some changes on

00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:46,919
the graphics driver Intel graphics

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:49,960
driver and that if you use those flags

00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:53,830
your system will behave better and we'll

00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,360
have a better it will have more mileage

00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,690
your battery will have more mileage

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,629
right the question here is how do you

00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:04,090
know that you have to actually set those

00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:06,610
flags right well that is something that

00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,710
we are working at Intel and trying to

00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,720
get that data out and for the community

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,429
to learn but I feel that we could work

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,749
in a better partnership with our

00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:20,320
distribution partners and and solidify

00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:24,190
those that methodology where this data

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:27,820
gets to their hands that's one place

00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:30,850
that I see that we can influence and get

00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,190
better at and I feel this forum is a

00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:36,399
great opportunity to open that

00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:39,669
discussion the second thing I feel that

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:43,049
we could do better is the distribution

00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:46,090
probably could have a database when they

00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:48,999
install the system where they know what

00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:51,909
are they best known configurations and

00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:54,669
match that to that configuration and

00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:56,619
that do that for the user so that the

00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:58,929
user doesn't have to run power top every

00:33:56,619 --> 00:34:02,230
time that they start the computer that

00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:04,179
would be very nice but that would take a

00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,940
lot of work I understand on their part

00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:10,179
of the distributions there is always a

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,559
happy medium right so the happy medium

00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:17,990
in my in my scenario here is how about

00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:21,379
given their ability to the user

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:24,679
of turning their power when they install

00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:26,510
their distribution on their computer mmm

00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,879
having the ability to survey what are

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:32,389
the devices probably using even power

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:35,360
top or a subsection of power top or you

00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:38,440
better the tool that you have that you

00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,639
like and run it while you do your

00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,040
installation so that those

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,200
configurations are kept and are kept

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:50,720
throughout the life of the computer I

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:56,169
feel that would be a very good thing if

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,169
it happens from from the distributions

00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:05,660
and then the other thing is well this is

00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:09,500
actually a boring one but I'm gonna be

00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:12,410
boring and use solid colors for your

00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,070
backgrounds because that's what it is up

00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:18,110
most of the times on the computer and

00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:24,670
yes it's boring but it says you guys

00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:27,530
says save a lot of power and then I

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,600
think that's all the things I feel that

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:33,830
we could do that I can think of at the

00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:36,650
moment I want also to invite before I go

00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:39,740
to that I want to invite everybody who

00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:42,650
is in this room to be part of power top

00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,609
as you are all users or most of your

00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,040
users

00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:49,730
it happens them I am also the maintainer

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:54,500
of power top hint of the presentation

00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:57,740
right and it's a really nice community

00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,710
and it's growing and we accept patches

00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:05,060
from everybody's an open source project

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:08,300
and it would be really nice if we get

00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,970
more people engaged so I would like to

00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,660
invite you all to go to one dad or

00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:18,710
forward slash power top and get our

00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:21,290
repos and start contributing and have

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,970
ideas and bring them on and then with

00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:27,970
that I want to thank you and open the

00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,970
questions

00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:42,360
so just two quick questions the first is

00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,660
so how much in aggregate we were able to

00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:49,260
increase your battery life so this is

00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:55,110
this was a system that lasts six hours

00:36:49,260 --> 00:37:00,840
and 30 minutes and I put it so it was

00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:03,750
lasting about four hours at first and I

00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:06,090
then I was lasting the five and then the

00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,280
food six and a half and sometimes a

00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:13,740
little more sometimes a little less it

00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:17,400
changes right if I go back in terms of

00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:21,420
time my last slide one of the last

00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:24,540
slides tell us the one with the screen

00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,370
this one that's the most amount of time

00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,920
that you can that you will get this is

00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:34,950
this is I did everything in here I had

00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:39,350
my one color on the background I turned

00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:43,200
my system using power table and I also

00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:45,860
added all the flags on my colonel let's

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,910
start up and so that did the trick for

00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:51,930
gaining four hours and 35 minutes

00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:55,320
altogether and the other question was so

00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:58,380
how does compare to other operating

00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:01,560
systems that's a good question so

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:04,470
actually Windows is doing a really good

00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,780
job at tuning their operating systems to

00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:10,560
the new platforms they are very

00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:13,320
aggressive and they work with Intel into

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,210
getting their systems but it turns out

00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:20,070
that at the open source Technology

00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:23,790
Center we only do Linux right so it's

00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:26,250
been the visibility has been increasing

00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:31,280
and there are more themes and more

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:33,780
people and more engagement in that sense

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,780
there are a lot of platforms of course

00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,030
and that is Android and then there are

00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,690
they all do different distributions but

00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:46,410
the idea is that with these

00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:47,430
presentations I'm giving I aspired more

00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:50,490
Intel

00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:53,069
in the community so that the different

00:38:50,490 --> 00:39:01,890
distributions open and help and do more

00:38:53,069 --> 00:39:03,599
work in terms of power management I'm

00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:07,440
sure I could look this up when I get

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,339
home but is power top at Intel specific

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,450
tool or does it work with other

00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:17,760
processor that's a very good question so

00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:22,920
power table works mostly on Intel

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:28,130
platforms I know it has ports into some

00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:30,420
are ARM architecture and also AMD

00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:33,270
unfortunately I don't have any of these

00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,250
things and I don't do tests of them we

00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:39,210
have a validation team which does and

00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:41,609
which do but is very narrow telescope in

00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,799
there in that terms but yes they have

00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:46,910
support and again is an open source

00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:49,890
project so if you see that you have a

00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:52,319
nice processor that you want to be out

00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,480
the ability for that be my guest

00:39:52,319 --> 00:40:05,359
bring it on and we receive your patches

00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:05,359
and we make it happen yes right here

00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:12,900
just to provide a bit more detail on the

00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,220
arm stuff it's slightly more got Intel

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,780
are quite organized about having all

00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,880
those power states and it's concise and

00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,830
consistent across the entire chip family

00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,440
chip families and AMD have done the same

00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:23,580
kind of thing whereas an arm world

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,010
there's all sorts of power states but

00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:28,260
they're completely different on every

00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:30,720
chip family so it's a lot harder to go

00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,730
what do we even call these states so you

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,770
haven't got the same consistency which

00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,690
makes it rather harder to kind of

00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,240
provide the same feedback but still

00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:40,619
there is reasonable support for at least

00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,050
some chipset so I'm not exactly sure

00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:44,070
what is and isn't and they they've

00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,080
realized this is a problem and people

00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:48,690
have at least standardizing some kind of

00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,130
level names I haven't been keeping up

00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,510
with exactly what's been going on but

00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,690
basically Linares been doing quite a lot

00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:57,740
this for last four years so you get more

00:40:54,690 --> 00:41:00,869
or less the same experience thank you I

00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,840
think we ran out of time they show me

00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:07,109
that we're car already so if you have

00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:11,570
more questions I will be at the hole in

00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:11,570
the next session son thank you very much

00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:20,490
and don't forget to turn your systems in

00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,490
