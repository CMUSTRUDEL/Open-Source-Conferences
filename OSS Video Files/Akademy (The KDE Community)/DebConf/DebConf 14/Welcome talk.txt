dealing with jet lag everybody got some

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,710

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,659
great sessions this week we've got quite

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,369
the lineup as you may have seen the

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,420
schedule the schedule this year is

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,640
different than it's been in the past

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,430
where rather than having a Deb camp

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,720
beforehand in a Deb Kampf week as two

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,909
separate weeks we're doing something

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,040
where we're kind of intertwining the two

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,439
and so we've got we've got a schedule

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,540
that allows for a full set of talks but

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,610
also some some dedicated hack time so

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,649
take advantage of that do great stuff

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,899
enjoy the talks talk with people

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,159
socialize all that goodness hopefully

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,600
you'll find the format to your liking

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,780
and if you don't we want to hear that

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,780
feedback as well but yeah enjoy the

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,459
conference

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,530
what else can I say you you stole my

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,180
introductions which I I was going to

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,420
introduce a little bit of the local team

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,520
here is for a bit so Gerald Turner

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,989
all-around great guy awesome community

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,489
member here in Portland who is our

00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:27,340
cheese Meister which is one reason why

00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:28,600
you should see his face so coming up we

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,730
have the cheese and wine party the

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,580
traditional social event going on on

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,290
Monday so of if you don't want your

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,519
cheese to melt on the way to the venue

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,250
you probably want to get it to him

00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,599
before the evening of Monday so there

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,060
will be information going out about that

00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,560
but this is Gerald when you see him

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:50,410
thank him for all his great works on

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,660
this conference and case cook who's

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:57,010
who's been the mastermind behind getting

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,239
us a network from working for this

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,000
conference as you see we're actually

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,650
embedded into the Portland State Network

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,170
so you're actually using standard PSU

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,269
network infrastructure rather than Deb

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,769
comp infrastructure this year hopefully

00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:11,019
that's holding up for everybody we've

00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:12,459
also got you know wired hat clubs and

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:17,859
other stuff as well if it's not working

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:19,630
for you but you know he's trying to

00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:21,549
trying to pass the credit to Matt

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:27,670
Taggart who I don't see in the audience

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:30,130
Matt if you're here stand up Matt also

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,079
part of the local team who he's local in

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,549
that he's in Seattle where the rain

00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:37,690
actually falls let's see so other other

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,120
members of the local team if you could

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,280
just stand up now and and like show your

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:48,040
faces Pietro I know you're here vagrant

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,180
Tony yes we've got very very committed

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,820
team that has put this conference

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:56,739
together and thank you all they should

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:59,549
be standing up here with us we we don't

00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:59,549
need to punish everybody

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:06,590
anyway what else can I say I do have a

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:12,500
list of announcements will the owner of

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:13,970
a white Chevy know um I think they have

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,340
cars in other countries to that joke

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,829
might play I don't know

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,200
so announcements first of all if you're

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,870
sitting in this room you are not in the

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,150
off-camera area so just so you know all

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,220
of the the set up this year due to the

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,850
the orientation of the rooms and whatnot

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,590
in order to be able to see audience

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,830
members speaking on camera as well

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:39,950
effectively the actual rooms are a

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,570
hundred percent you may be filmed so if

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,520
you are concerned about being filmed we

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,750
do recommend that you make you take

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,250
advantage of the hecklers because we do

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,390
have live streams for all of those talks

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,970
so you should be able to participate

00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,430
remotely in theory if you are concerned

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,410
about being not captured on camera

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,330
you also not going to be standing up and

00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,530
asking questions so hopefully this works

00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,880
for everybody if there are any concerns

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,160
about that you can come talk to me about

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,750
it and we can try to figure out how to

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,460
make it work for you better if that's

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,660
not a solution

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:11,080
ad hoc talk scheduling so part of part

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,550
of what's going on here is we do have

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,610
during our blocks of hack time we know

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,770
that that hacking is not a solo activity

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,570
necessarily and so we want to also give

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,450
you the opportunity to to schedule

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,520
spaces where you can sit down and have

00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:27,290
you know small group discussions and

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,000
whatnot so all of the talk rooms will be

00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,410
available for that during the the

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,030
periods of time which are blocked as

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,440
hack time on the schedule there the

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,710
scheduling for those rooms will be done

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,530
on the wiki the pages will be open for

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,300
scheduling 24 hours in advance in order

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,479
to make sure that it is in fact ad hoc

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,490
and not people you know squatting the

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,229
rooms for those kinds of things so but

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,000
it is available so if you have things

00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,960
where you you think oh gee it would be

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,370
good to have a place where we can

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,600
actually have a meeting about this thing

00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,070
that's available to you as well

00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,600
DEP Kampf disgusts if you're not

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,180
subscribe to that it is recommended that

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,100
you be just in terms of flow of

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,140
information during the conference we do

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,390
send out we try to get major things sent

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,680
out to deb comp - announce sometimes

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,249
there's a little bit of delay before

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,289
those things get

00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:16,489
so Deb Kampf discuss also you know

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,629
there's a lot of information going

00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:19,579
around that doesn't necessarily come

00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,989
from the organizers as organizers but

00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,729
that's that's useful for people to know

00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:25,429
about so if you want to tap into the

00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,859
what's going on dev comp discuss please

00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:28,999
make sure you're subscribed it's it's a

00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:30,289
very useful resource during the

00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:33,469
conference to keep track of what's going

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:35,359
on other stuff you know if there's

00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:38,149
anything that you're not sure about the

00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:39,139
front desk which I I'm not sure are

00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,569
there front desk people here in the

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:43,429
audience yes right back there there's

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:51,709
front desk people so give them a round

00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:53,719
of applause they do a tremendous job

00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:55,819
every year of making sure the conference

00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:57,829
runs smoothly and they're the only fixed

00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:59,509
point within the entire system that

00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:01,819
people can actually go to and and

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,379
coordinate so if you if you're not sure

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,119
where something is or where someone is

00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,039
or what's going on the front desk is

00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:10,639
there it's just down the hall it's

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,099
labeled front desk etc and it's it's the

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,059
it's the nexus of a it's the brain of

00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:18,949
the conference right there so we've had

00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:20,299
a couple of changes to the schedule

00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:22,669
which happened late which I want to make

00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:24,679
sure people know about the there was

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:28,159
some confusion about available meal

00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:30,409
times which led to a late change in our

00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:32,629
dinner schedule as well as our evening

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:34,399
talk schedule so rather than having the

00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:36,829
last talk of the day be it from 5:00 to

00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,299
5:45 it turns out that dinner at the at

00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,459
the university cafeteria is going to be

00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:42,319
served from 5:00 to 6:30 so rather than

00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:45,169
having everybody rush to get served

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,449
dinner in in a 45 minute block right

00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:49,279
after the last talk the last talk of the

00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,349
evening each day is going to be from 7

00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,989
p.m. to 7:45 and that takes effect

00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:57,819
starting today so we will have dinner at

00:07:53,989 --> 00:08:00,619
5:00 and an after-dinner talk at 7:00

00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:03,829
you may have noticed as well if you are

00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:05,360
in sponsored food that there was a bit

00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:06,979
of a problem this morning with the

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,899
brunch opening times

00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:11,209
my apologies there was some

00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,619
communication issues with with with the

00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:13,969
university about that we believe we have

00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:16,189
this straightened out so going forward

00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:19,369
the meal times are as documented on the

00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:21,439
wiki and on the schedule brunch starting

00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:23,599
is at 11:00 it should run from 11:00 to

00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,849
1:00

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,779
thirty I believe is the correct time

00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:31,099
don't take my word for it the the the

00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:32,360
wiki and the schedule know better than I

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:34,729
do

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,319
there's also the coffee I think I've

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,750
alluded to that earlier we have

00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:42,589
organized coffee to be made available to

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:45,560
all attendees if you show your badge the

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:47,360
the drip coffee and espresso and loose

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,790
leaf tea which is down at Olay latte

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,829
which is just two blocks and I'm gonna

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,690
point the right way two blocks that way

00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,610
it's a nice little coffee cart if you've

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,380
never been to Portland before card sort

00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,470
of thing here food cards beverage cards

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,089
it's it's the way to go and so there's a

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,370
coffee cart under the parking garage

00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:11,209
serves great coffee who here has had the

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:12,949
coffee already Oh nobody's disappointed

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:16,850
alright or nobody will admit to it in

00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:19,100
front of paddy so yeah I mean take

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:22,069
advantage of that it's it's sponsored by

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,180
the conference choice of drinks etc and

00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:24,709
they give you a discount if you want

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,399
something other than those the basic

00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:31,459
drinks as well ok I need to ask about

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,980
volunteers for the cheese and wine party

00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:36,230
I just wrote asked for volunteers for

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,790
cheese and wine party so I'm asking for

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,709
volunteers for the cheese and wine party

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,740
we do need people to help with I believe

00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:45,699
it's mostly the moving of things and

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:50,269
setup so if you're going to be available

00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:52,220
Tuesday Monday Monday 6:00 p.m. then we

00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,300
want some volunteers for that and Gerald

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,860
is going to be the person to coordinate

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,569
with as well and I believe we're gonna

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,920
have some announcement males with more

00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:04,779
details going out today tomorrow ish to

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,939
try to solidify the details on that Oh

00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,500
last thing I have is then that the we do

00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:11,089
have to hack labs if you've only seen

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,399
this floor of the building so far well

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:14,959
we have to hack labs and then we have

00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,430
the balcony and we have the park and we

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,649
have all these other wonderful spaces

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,480
that are available on the the PSU campus

00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,550
where you can absolutely feel free to

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,839
hack but if you've only seen this floor

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,730
you should be aware there is a second

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,160
hack lab which is downstairs the room

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:32,120
numbers 238 if you go down the stairs

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,680
it's basically it's this way and it's

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,600
called the browsing lounge you'll see

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,559
that sign first

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,459
but that's available to you especially

00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,119
since

00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:44,420
this hack lab over here which is room

00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:46,910
333 it there's there's some issues with

00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,829
the climate control in there we've got a

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,029
shade missing in one corner of it so

00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:51,769
it's getting a lot of Sun in the

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:54,110
afternoons and it is it's supposed to be

00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:56,029
rather warm this week so you may find

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,439
yourselves getting rather warm be aware

00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,480
the air conditioning is working great

00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:01,910
down in room 238 as far as I can tell so

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,300
that's available to you and and all it

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,800
costs you is a short walk down the

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,879
stairs or a short elevator trip to get

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,529
there oh right

00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,720
yeah this was this has been announced on

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,929
the Def Con fan outs as well I think but

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,410
the late night hack lab so this building

00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:23,240
closes at 10:00 p.m. every day they're

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,709
keeping it open for us past normal hours

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,720
so that we're able to make use of it

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:28,309
normally closes at 6:00 p.m. on Sundays

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,589
we're keeping it open till 10:00 p.m.

00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:32,720
for the conference so you will have

00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,019
access to this space however after 10:00

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,839
p.m.

00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:37,610
everybody has to be out of this building

00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:41,480
which means obviously since packing

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,350
doesn't obey time zones or schedules we

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,600
need to make sure that we're providing

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,329
for you and the solution we have in

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,889
place is the Broadway Residence Hall

00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:49,850
which is where most of the the people

00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,819
who are staying on campus

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,799
are staying that that building on the

00:11:52,819 --> 00:12:00,679
second floor which you get to through

00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:02,240
the Jackson Street no the sixth Avenue

00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,509
entrance instead of the Jackson Street

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,790
entrance

00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:07,360
so not the residential entrance but the

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,679
other entrance where you checked in

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,119
that's whole second floor is basically

00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,319
available for our use there's various

00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:13,579
lounge chairs there's actually

00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:16,429
classrooms that are available if you

00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,959
want a more sturdy hacking space feel

00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:20,029
free to make use of that in the evenings

00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,290
if you are not staying on campus you

00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:23,619
will not be able to get into that

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,970
building on your own after 8:00 p.m. I

00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:28,579
trust that you are all capable of

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,079
organizing a solution i I've never known

00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:33,309
Debian people to have any difficulty

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,110
organizing their way around anything so

00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:38,360
you know put buddy up with somebody who

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,920
is staying in the dorms feel free to

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,329
come by whether whether you it's it's

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,529
just a matter of you won't be able to

00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:44,299
get in the building but you are welcome

00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,040
to come over there and and make use of

00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:47,569
that space everybody who's attending the

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,170
conference has access to that space

00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:54,680
after well 24 hours

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:56,420
and that is all I have and I think we

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,540
had steve mcintyre had some sort of an

00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,769
announcement anything else before I

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,050
think that's it so yeah once again

00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:13,610
welcome to Deb comp and I hand it over

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:15,970
to uncle Steve but oh this thing is on

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,970
Wow

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,670
so a lot of people probably have noticed

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,100
we've had some quite heated discussions

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:31,250
in Debian in the last year or so hands

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:33,199
up anyone who hasn't there's been a lot

00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,480
of discussions going on some people have

00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:38,870
got very very tired of it there's been

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,370
some strong words in the middle of all

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,040
of it however there has been at least

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:47,110
one person who seems to have been able

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:50,300
to keep his head has not really well

00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,850
lost his cool at all that we can see I

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,060
know from discussing from talking to him

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,470
in other venues as well

00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,269
he's been going through a massive amount

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,339
of stress at work I know he's just

00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:03,920
changed employers and everything

00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:06,019
recently but that hasn't spilt over at

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,870
all in terms of how he's dealing with

00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:10,790
other people in Debian and I know I've

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:14,060
been very impressed lots of the rest of

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,050
us have and so we have a little well a

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:20,050
little something to show our

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:20,050
appreciation um Russ are you here

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,079
please come up

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,990
so this is very much instigated by some

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,700
of the folks in the UK in particular

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,190
laws of ours Aeneas who unfortunately

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,910
can't be here this week so he entrusted

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,700
this to me

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,740
Vince my good friend from the UK as well

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:57,320
was responsible for actually doing some

00:14:51,740 --> 00:15:00,050
of the manufacturing of this but Russ in

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,570
well commemoration of your massive

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:10,250
patience we would like to present you

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:18,110
with the Deb comm I'll let him read it

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:21,280
out well this is this is great because

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,280
now I have to figure out what to say

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,050
discussions happen threads are short

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,360
decisions are made threads get long

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:36,080
arguments get repeated links to threads

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:38,090
get posted on Reddit and HN Def Con okay

00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,590
so DEFCON level 5 discussions happen

00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,990
threads are short decisions are made

00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,750
threads get long arguments get repeated

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:48,080
the DEF CON level for links the threads

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:51,320
posted to Reddit and HN lwn writes about

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:55,850
the discussion DEFCON level three trolls

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:58,190
show up list masters ban people DEFCON

00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:02,690
level two UN Security Committee meets

00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:05,270
GRS or put are proposed and voted on dev

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,640
comm level 1 laser cannons are launched

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,060
in the planetary orbit Russ gets mildly

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,060
annoyed

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:38,980
so thank you very much and I think

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,360
that's it for us in preparing the

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,280
Welcome talk I was a bit confused

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,780
because I wasn't sure what to say and

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,240
when consulting with people it turns out

00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,770
that this is really it which is how I've

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,690
managed to actually miss the Welcome

00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,340
talks the last three that comes running

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,830
because it's short sweet'n out of the

00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,190
way so welcome and have a good

00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,599
conference

00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,599
[Applause]
