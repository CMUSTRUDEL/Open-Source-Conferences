	00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:08,429
we're here to discuss a little bit about

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,800
the missing in action team so first the

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,450
first idea is to to give some

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,150
information regarding how we are working

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,160
now and then we will open the microphone

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,289
and the discussion because we want to do

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,960
some slight change on the process and

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,400
the workflow but we want to hear about

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,890
it we want to hear what other people

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:32,940
things sorry I don't have a proper PDF

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,440
now so I will move quickly so right now

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,660
we work with different tools we have

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,910
some sort of scripts they are writing in

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,059
Python we have a database everything

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,879
isn't wants so the scripts do the

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,030
tracking we use the scripts to do save

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,309
status about the maintainer and to query

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,370
there is some service called carnivore

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,079
or a colon that actually pull out all

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,879
the information from the from the

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,770
mailing list to know when was the last

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,590
activity from the from the from the

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,949
maintainer so we also use that to check

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,810
we have a one primary channel the

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,700
password and everything the information

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,250
is on the wiki so if you want to join or

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,900
report over there is good and of course

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:19,080
the aliens which some people know so

00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,500
tracking is done manually that means

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,869
nobody is actually looking after me for

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,970
for for missing in action persons we

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,970
normally register the person who has

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,850
been reported to us or if we bond with

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,890
my people who looks not active we are

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,189
manually added to the to the database

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,110
then we use several tools when I when I

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,549
say it several tools includes even

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,439
social network I have been even

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,200
contacting people on Twitter and

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,079
Facebook to see their whereabouts so

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,810
that's up to every team member how how

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,329
they decide to do the tracking so now we

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,030
will we have several F status this is

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,790
the current situation so we have all

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,850
these status which represent what people

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,159
is doing okay is the normal then we move

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,960
to VC and then we start to move to DIF

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,590
that was like in Afton or responsible

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,110
retiring

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,360
until we get to Mia and then we are from

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,890
the package then we just do it move to

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,810
tune it's worth

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,310
with the Debian icon money I need to

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:29,220
take the decision I remove the account

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:32,520
etc you can so we have a way to reset

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,170
the status normally there is a full

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,850
reset which is ok and there is one

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,980
temporary reset that we use that it's

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,900
called will fix so sometimes we ask

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,420
people how are you doing and people say

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,250
ok I'm busy and I will come back in

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,230
several months so we'll use fee we'll

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,880
fix and put like we'll fix in three

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,470
months then we manually check again if

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,480
the people have actually improved the

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,510
situation pocket has been updated or

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,250
whatever and then we decided to move to

00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:01,260
ok and we have different plot levels

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,940
first we start with nice which is a very

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,820
nice email how you do it in everything

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,890
is ok can we help then we start to move

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,650
a little bit more rude and ask okay you

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:13,530
need probably more comment a nurse and

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,480
then with issue a less warning telling

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,160
ok if you don't do anything we will find

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,180
your package and then we decide to work

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,390
from the package ok this is how we

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,200
update the status we normally do it by

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,660
email with some specific information on

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,120
the heaters so we can put comments there

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,799
so the comments are somehow privately

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,440
because we include information regarding

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,810
what it's happening with the people we

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,850
use several ways to to see to into

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,850
fourth the order thing members to see ok

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,870
this guy has foreign amuse or it has not

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:52,830
been uploading for one year or whatever

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,660
and that's it so I will hand the

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,750
microphone to Ana she was working also

00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,760
with on this on the new ideas and Mona's

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,190
who is the other team member who is

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,350
remotely participating and I will move

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:16,489
to the Titan pot so anyone is welcome to

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:20,310
to edit ok so what what we want to do is

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:23,430
first the first idea came to start doing

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,789
some reporting using web interface to

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,750
make it life easy and to have some way

00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,790
of

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,530
inform the people back what we are doing

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,170
because sometimes you send an email to

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,620
the aliens and probably you will never

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,690
get an answer but so action is taking in

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,860
the background then I know we need to

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:46,050
improve that but only if there is the

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,590
people who reported the people who is

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,810
missing in action have a way to check

00:04:48,590 --> 00:05:00,900
how is everything going it can relieve

00:04:51,810 --> 00:05:04,290
some frustration and then we want to

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,780
change the workflow also and remove the

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,600
current decorum plenty of a status and

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:14,220
prod and do like Fulmer shows everything

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,919
and change for example define specific

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:22,169
times like start with our first warning

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:23,880
and give 16 weeks to react then move to

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,040
a second one in and move to a final

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,320
warning there are further pockets so we

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,650
want to reduce all these status like a

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,590
responsible owner is responsible or

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,990
whatever and just use three or four to

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:40,130
make things easy to us and to other

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,130
people who want to contribute

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,690
so the new idea is just to have this

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,700
sort this set of reminders ok first

00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,130
reminder sec reminded Tara might and it

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,820
will fix and then move to Nick's wat and

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,520
that's it

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,350
another question that we were having is

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,090
how much of the information can be

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,370
available for everyone because some

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:14,320
people asked for example what is going

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,790
on but as I say before we normally put

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,100
private comments because some people

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:22,400
actually tell us ok I ain't changing

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,520
jobs or I'm doing these and we actually

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,460
add that information to the database so

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,040
we know how to us and be more human when

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,669
we ask because it is a kind of awkward

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,560
job to asking someone to to do something

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:46,340
on the on the plate when they are when

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:51,830
they are not active and this is our

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:54,190
current situation as I was first we have

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,780
several people who needs to be contacted

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,350
several people who needs to be contacted

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:06,890
for the second time and some people that

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:08,930
the party needs to be orphan and the

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,169
discussion that the keyring maintainer

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,270
has lately about pinging the people who

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:16,760
has weaker keys on the on the keyring

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,830
and decide what to do with it that it's

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,350
the post it will be nice to coordinate

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,660
together so we can actually decide what

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:27,789
to do with these people probably

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,789
included manually pin from the meeting

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,660
also a sparrow also offer tools we save

00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:39,110
the mail books with all the all the

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,669
conversation with the maintainer who

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,190
have interacted so that we have a

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,919
collection of mail box for freshmen T

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,080
never been tracked so everyone who

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,360
joined the team for example and want to

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,039
check what happened a year before the

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,740
people was contacted can open the

00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,360
meadows and follow the threads and even

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,169
using that information to contact the

00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,169
people work again

00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:15,169
but it's open for discussion so I will

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:17,410
really love with someone inside to my

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,410
group

00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:36,899
justice there we go so on the the

00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:39,449
private versus public status it might be

00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:42,689
very worthwhile to come up with some

00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:44,370
indicators of status that don't include

00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,290
all obviously the personal information

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,350
so you could still be able to provide

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,730
that overall status you know that says

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,199
you know we're working with the

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,060
maintainer or we're working with the

00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:56,069
developer or you know basically

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,220
something that would allow someone to

00:08:56,069 --> 00:09:01,290
see that is actively being worked for -

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,170
you know the situation is in good shape

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:08,060
or a bad shape without exposing the

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,060
personal information okay

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:28,310
so with the current set of timings are

00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:32,790
we not being possibly too nice to people

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:34,620
well and sometimes we lack of time you

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:38,820
know sometimes it happened like we do a

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:42,150
pink and we wait and the for weeks or

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,660
whatever becomes 1 1 or 2 months it's

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:47,130
shown

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,560
I mean so when males are sent out I mean

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,090
so the system at the moment I mean I've

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,650
looked into this I've pinged a few

00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,660
people over over the years and whatever

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,540
I've forgotten the details I'm getting

00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,180
old my memory fades I mean do they do

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,730
the existing tools actually keep track

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,650
and automatically we're not paying

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:10,410
people to say we haven't heard from this

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:12,360
person should they say good idea yeah I

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:17,100
mean you know that that's that that's

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,440
the kind of thing I'm thinking we were

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,290
talking about automatic ultimate I seen

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:27,150
this but with a manual handling so you

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:29,640
prepare the approach here because the

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,800
discussion there has been like sending

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,400
automatic emails it's a little

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,220
impersonal and this task requires on

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,840
social interaction I mean it's very sad

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,640
to ask someone what you're doing and

00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,530
then it's better when you when you

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:49,730
actually write the email and try to be a

00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:53,130
little bit worn the we talked with Anna

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,440
couple days ago about database with

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,600
contributors that'd be enough because

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,820
there's a lot of overlap and the

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,910
contributors is already attacking

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,920
people's activity very coarsely it only

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:08,340
tells you I've seen activity on that

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,650
team that date yeah actually we even use

00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,280
at least me for example use contributors

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:19,400
to see oh information that I don't have

00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:22,650
on the order system so I could

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:26,430
reasonably easily add some new features

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:29,310
to contributors things that we discussed

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:32,070
where the ability for anyone that is

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,329
logged in Debian contributors so both

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,910
Dee Dee's and people with ally of

00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:38,709
pounds to go to a person page and click

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,170
report as me okay

00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:43,600
we have a comment added by Ricardo with

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,629
the alerting member working on me that

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,569
is the first here that which we should

00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:51,790
include a mandatory field explaining why

00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:55,839
or giving some information when you do

00:11:51,790 --> 00:12:00,189
the reporting report as me with field

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:02,019
yep saying I wanted you know we can even

00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:05,829
check the status dead for example we can

00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:07,509
check at least has been reported or is

00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:09,730
being track it or like two or three

00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:12,129
visible status not the full status we

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,470
have in the database will be cool so if

00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:16,720
you log in back you can see how is the

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,730
how the contributor is doing it it's

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,399
already being track it or not so I could

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,910
have for each person in the contributors

00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:27,369
a Mia report log to wherever people

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:31,449
reported as potentially Mia with with

00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:33,489
the text field saying why and then if

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:35,499
someone is locked in host part of the me

00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:39,129
a team they can see all the logs and

00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:41,230
they could click a button to send ping

00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:44,470
where again with a text field with

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,949
things to put in the email and that

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:51,819
would also be logged the email may even

00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:53,679
have like click here to reply that goes

00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:55,689
on the website and ask to the Mia log

00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,299
the message saying well I'm actually

00:12:55,689 --> 00:13:06,839
alive

00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:09,850
with its above so I said what could be I

00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:14,110
from a different team I'm kind of saying

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:16,749
what could I can offer so that will have

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:20,819
a sort of lightweight well not

00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:23,259
lightweight but simplified but a swift

00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:26,619
workflow because you essentially lock

00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:30,399
there and see a log with with all the

00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:33,489
reports and what the person said and

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:39,489
make like a very qualitative judgment

00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:43,679
about what's going on so yeah those are

00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:43,679
reasonably easy to implement okay

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,990
to what extent does this have any kind

00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,960
of API because I want to do I'm part of

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:59,020
the DSA team and I want to basically

00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,120
close a lot of shell accounts because

00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,660
currently we have a zillion shell

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,060
accounts and like you pointed out with

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,910
about 500 people being in various states

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:13,060
of missing in actions then that's kind

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,420
of accounts I might want to close or I

00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,680
wanted so what I want to do is both

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,690
restraint so people don't have accounts

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,240
on systems by default but they I have an

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:25,150
easy way to do I need an account in this

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:30,580
Porter box now please and then that gets

00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:32,230
provisioned real-time basically so by

00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,480
default you can't just log into a pot

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,590
box you'll you'll have to kind of go run

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,710
this command and the other thing I want

00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:45,670
to do is currently we don't expire

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:48,040
people from teams so being able to track

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,980
a little bit especially if there's it if

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,960
there's a way for for me to take the

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,150
information from possibly from

00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,280
contributors or from some of the things

00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,930
you are tracking so I can figure out

00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,360
that oh yeah you actually haven't done

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,950
anything to the website for the last I

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,870
carry a little time the query

00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,060
information is busy before all these you

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,940
just need to log in on console okay and

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,280
then you can check the rate meter you

00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,990
can see your comments you can see what

00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,350
was going on with the people there is

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,940
one call it may have to do is the one

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,340
that pulled the information that is in

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:24,730
the in the bottom one that you see over

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:27,940
there see and actually give you the the

00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,940
login and everything the Thursday key is

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,760
that in the first ball first ball format

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,220
or is that completely free for we use we

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,800
use two files we use one made books and

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,540
we use another guy sort of database we

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,180
generate text file and some Python

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,930
scripts that do everything - okay yeah

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,930
sounds good

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:57,790
like me a team usually you measure

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,440
inactivity right yeah for me it kind of

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,450
seems reverse because when I find

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,250
something that's broken I'm gonna fix it

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,710
I realized the person is probably Mia

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:09,000
for a really long time and then I need

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:12,430
to kick-start the Mia process which on

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,550
basic timings if person is me and not

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,800
replying is like 28 weeks or plus which

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,220
is like half a year but did you have an

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:25,240
M you true I still have an immune that's

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:27,160
true and like like yesterday we talked

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,460
about setting the expiry date on the

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:34,750
keys to self expire people can we assume

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:37,300
that everyone is Mia then measure

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,640
activity and to see if there is any

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:43,090
activity within last year you are okay

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,460
and then and if there are no activity

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:47,800
that we can automatically detect in the

00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:50,290
past year or for example two years or

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,860
three years right then we kind of shoot

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,810
ping those people near even all if even

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,960
if all of their packages have zero bugs

00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:01,480
and they have no posts on mailing list

00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,270
no logins to any shell accounts no

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,790
uploads no sponsorships no nothing such

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:09,370
that we could kind of proactively clean

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:12,160
people and kind of have expiry on your

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:14,980
activity by default instead of like

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,500
measuring in activity I understand your

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,829
reverse yeah if they love The Fault in

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:35,200
okay defaulting Mia yeah I think I mean

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:37,570
it can be quite complicated I think it

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,570
was said before that automated males are

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,610
impersonal I want to balance the point

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,080
that when you act when you interact with

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,550
a package maintainer that it doesn't

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,890
answer for months it's even more

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:51,340
impersonal and I think I would balance

00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:53,290
the impersonal mail just paying and do

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,690
something about your package is better

00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,690
than attracting with Amaya people

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:09,390
about uh about the Mia by default

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:11,760
there's a problem there bein in that no

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,340
it's it's essentially impossible to

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,650
track all possible Devine activity if

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,330
somebody is a Debian contributor and

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:22,350
what they do is taking care of

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:26,160
Vietnamese translation they would get an

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,260
email a year saying are still alive and

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,380
it's not that nice on the other hand

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,230
it's nice that as long as everything is

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,170
fine in my work I don't get pinged even

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,360
if I don't do anything so I hope it

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,990
makes sense that things are triggered

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,120
when something is lacking and I'm all

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,070
for shortening the time because if

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,440
things are triggered when something is

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,310
lacking say there's RC bugs that are

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,320
unanswered then we shouldn't wait six

00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:58,530
months those bugs should have been

00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,740
answered in the first place so if I go

00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:05,310
and see a package that has dead activity

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:08,430
in the BTS for some time and I've see

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,870
bugs and I want to take it over I would

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,270
believe that we could move to a

00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,820
situation where it's easier to take over

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:17,970
things when they are not properly

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,440
maintained I have one question for for

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,390
now that I see an evil and some other

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,310
people I remembered when when we

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,450
implement the Debian maintainer process

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:33,240
it was required to do an annual thing

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:41,970
that has been done they supposed to send

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:48,090
a ping every now it's carrying

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:53,040
on from Dimitri Enrique I mean it is

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:54,840
difficult to reliably detect activity so

00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,370
a lot of our contributors may not

00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,870
necessarily contribute all that

00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,850
regularly or it might be very difficult

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,670
to track them I think we all understand

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,750
that if we get to the stage if you're in

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:10,080
m.i.a then that means you already a DD

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:12,210
is it unreasonable to expect that either

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,549
we should seek and come to

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,379
and somehow we can track or we know so

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,879
we send the mail won't they know once

00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:20,730
every six months if we haven't seen

00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:22,590
anything in six months and by all means

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,340
there will be some false positives to

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:28,230
start with but if you know we send mail

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,080
to people and say we don't think we've

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,669
seen any contributions if you think you

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,590
have can you police tell us were and

00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:36,600
help us to help us to track those in

00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,659
future that will be a really good answer

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:43,169
to that but we definitely we should be

00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:45,179
able to do this and send a definitely an

00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:47,039
impersonal email and say sorry this

00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,139
sounds in personal book but our

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,669
automated systems don't think that they

00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:52,409
you know don't seem to be able to find

00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:55,499
anything apologies if they're wrong

00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:57,360
please help us fix them actually we have

00:20:55,499 --> 00:21:00,059
in the in the according a scenario the

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,090
the the MPA which is non package

00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:06,149
activity so you can theoretically March

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:09,059
someone like okay this guy is doing wave

00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:10,950
and it's not trackable and leave it

00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,259
there but after that there's no way to

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,389
track there was on this question with an

00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,299
entirely ready in that and the point was

00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:20,759
we supposed to care take care about the

00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,610
package more than they than the the

00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:27,200
tracking the people itself so I'm

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:31,230
thinking we need to bother somehow I

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:36,779
wonder if if there's a way to possibly

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:41,309
expedite transfer of packages from Ana

00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:43,049
am i a maintainer to a team so there's

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:45,269
been a couple of packages which I've nm

00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:50,340
you'd and and I've sent yeah there's

00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:53,519
been clearly no no no I know activity by

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,679
the maintainer and I'd be interested in

00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,389
in adopting it but not as a sole

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,279
maintainer but transferring the

00:21:57,389 --> 00:22:03,570
ownership of that package to a team and

00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,840
it's always possible for that maintainer

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:09,090
to wake up and say I still am interested

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,889
in it that's very unqualified students

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,889
who take care of the orphan package I

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,460
know what you mean because I have done

00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:23,159
that is cocking packages so you see the

00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,350
package EDA is no mentoring traveling so

00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,880
you start loading it but keep the person

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,910
the

00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,510
Oh brothers and after sometimes you

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:35,240
remove it some people do that in plenty

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,830
of cases I think it's a good option but

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,679
it's still reporting this person to Mia

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:42,020
it's good because this person might

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,000
either what we I couldn't mean we

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,950
actually depends on the scenario but

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,289
sometimes we get reports people telling

00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,750
us like okay I actually very interesting

00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:52,910
on this packet and we skip all the

00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,740
process together and we say okay let's

00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:57,679
do this as a warning for the maintainer

00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,840
please take the package and and leave

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,799
and leave the being a process to

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,330
continue in the background so but I get

00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,120
your point like you mean like having a

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:18,799
team to specifically maintain some

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:21,289
pocket that hadn't been neglected this

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,780
package would naturally fit in this team

00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:26,330
and because they're the sole maintainer

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,789
you know we we have a process where we

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,289
can you know adopt that package into the

00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:31,909
team and let the team maintain it but I

00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:35,090
like your idea of just keeping them

00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:56,120
there while the MIAA process goes on and

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:59,480
then if they do wake up then do we

00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,789
separate which activity requires your GP

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,880
GT to be in the uploader steering and

00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:06,650
which activity does not and if all of

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,530
your activity does not actually require

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:12,380
your gbg queueing to be an uploader

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:15,860
steering for example you only vote and

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:19,460
you only commit for example translations

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:22,610
bias viento alias right then your key

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,500
your GPG key you're uploading TD you

00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,630
don't actually make any uploads should

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,429
it be in the uploader skewing but that

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,400
will be something like moving the

00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:36,200
existing developers or loading / a lot

00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:38,210
in developers to them applauding yeah

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,590
well I'm just grabbing the microphone

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,870
away from you because say

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:46,850
it's not the first time I hear this in

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:51,499
during the becomes I do not think well I

00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:54,679
know it's not a hierarchical set of

00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:56,809
privileges but let's say a several

00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,580
people have told me we should the mote

00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,919
their accounts that do not show activity

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,190
in some way the thing is it's quite

00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,110
involved if I have to move an account

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,749
from one to the other keyring I also

00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:12,799
have to ask DSA to change the account

00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:15,710
type and a and and well maybe I am being

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:18,860
responsive I'm not doing uploads for

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:22,009
some packages but I a for my packages I

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:26,299
mean but I can still keep that ability

00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:28,850
so I mean yeah we want to require people

00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:30,499
to keep up to date not only with their

00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:43,970
activity but they with the current

00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:46,519
practices so what I think is important

00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,399
here is for people that I don't think we

00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:51,679
should remove people from uploading

00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:54,919
keyring because they don't upload what I

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:59,110
think we should consider is it's things

00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:02,029
like if you never use your GPT key then

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:04,429
maybe it's not a good idea for it exists

00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:08,619
in the keyring at all because that means

00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:11,480
that potentially we have a cryptographic

00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:13,519
credential out there which it's not

00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,320
under good control control so it's not

00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,840
about uploading versus non uploading

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,549
because like if you vote for instance

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,249
then you're actually used in your API

00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:25,190
key and and that's the same same

00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:27,889
approach I'm using for the their

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:31,119
accounts and groups is that if you're

00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:34,399
actively using a group or actively using

00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:36,799
an account on the portal box then I

00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:38,899
don't want to shut that down but if you

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,450
have an account on a portable and you've

00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:43,789
never logged in there for like in the

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,769
five years that machine has existed then

00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:48,399
that account should have been there in

00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:48,399
the first place

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:59,270
I think we see a trend here in in not

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,150
having everything in one account I mean

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:04,460
not being a DD means being able to vote

00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,020
having an email address being able to

00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,910
upload etcetera etc and I think the

00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,130
current trend is dividing these things

00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:13,040
in having these virus thing expire that

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,600
doesn't mean that you lose your email

00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,880
address or the right to vote when you

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,010
when someone orphans your package is

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,820
because you're not doing work and I

00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:25,070
think it's quite important to do not

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,650
consider the AMIA like we remove you

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:30,980
from being a DD and that's the long

00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:33,590
process really nice on we you know our

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,540
last step is orphan the packet then

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,240
everything moves to the vehicle money

00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,250
and it's their decision to do whatever

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,590
they want to do with the with the person

00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,510
I mean my main main point here is

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,460
package has not been maintained it

00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:50,990
should be orphan and then then we decide

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:53,270
after that was yeah whether you're a DD

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,580
or not does actually not it's not

00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,350
actually decided by whether you have a

00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,190
key in the keyring or whether you have

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:04,850
an account on Debian systems damn decide

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:06,950
to is a TV and they ask keyring

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,410
maintainer to add the keys of those

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,720
people to the keyring and I don't think

00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,490
that there's ever been a case where they

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,010
haven't added that key but they are

00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,200
actually free to not do so and similar

00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:20,270
they they will ask DSA to create an

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,610
account and we're actually free not to

00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:25,010
do so and I don't believe that has ever

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:32,780
ever happened but these are actually

00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:35,930
three separate concepts an active key

00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:40,310
reminded me that we do not currently

00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:43,420
have a system to audit key usage so when

00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:45,860
I log into my bank I get an email saying

00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,410
there's been a login into your account

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,170
it would be nice to have a log of every

00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:54,320
time my GPG key has been used in debian

00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:57,400
so I could see if there is some use that

00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,200
wasn't me and I detected it lay attacks

00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,920
the same could be used if if that

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,550
actually works

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,620
in a way that there's no way Jiki use

00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,320
that is not tracked with this it can

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,600
also be used to see that that he hasn't

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:19,070
been used for like three years and then

00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:24,690
move it to time out killing of some kind

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:27,360
yeah also yeah Eklund actually tracks

00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:30,390
that so in LDAP there's a field which

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,580
says when a key was last used and where

00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,790
so that's tracked on debian lists and

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,650
uploads and yes we also worry live

00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,660
information yeah it's it's not used

00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:42,390
everywhere like it I don't think it

00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:45,300
attracts votes for instance but in oh

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:49,620
boy it attracts a certain amount of tip

00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:52,260
cheeky usage even sign the demons very

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:59,940
good available does it also track SSH

00:29:52,260 --> 00:30:03,390
clear usage so I am going to check of it

00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,280
the topic of the discussion I would like

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,840
to talk about a phenomena we have been

00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,960
experiencing in the last two three years

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,520
that are they found on my trainers so

00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,320
there are people you go to their

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,380
developer page the main things I don't

00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:19,320
know 15 20 packages but actually they

00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,150
are doing no job interview at all they

00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,950
just having a they are just common

00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,510
tenant in several teens for example the

00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:27,150
first thing is a very good example of

00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,860
this but they have no activity used as

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:33,510
some moment yet themselves to maintain

00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:34,980
airs so I would like to to us York that

00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,260
if you have a comment any who is doing

00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,960
no no a Java troll in the packages to

00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:42,450
remove them because it made sometimes

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:47,940
they the query team brave and mei-mei

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:51,960
thing work very difficult well remove it

00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:53,670
and notify us yeah ideally a maintenance

00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,710
contribution should be tracked by the

00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:58,080
change look instead of the maintainer

00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:00,870
field we currently have a problem with

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,510
dch not putting an email address in the

00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:06,510
square bracket when there's comment in

00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:08,610
it it only uses the full name so try

00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:12,120
tracking by a Nelson and look up who

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:15,240
know if you can and I reported a couple

00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,559
of days ago back to BCH asking if there

00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,730
could be the email address at least

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,620
added to that and I don't know how much

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,990
that would break but at least that would

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,940
make people's activity trackable via the

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:30,570
changelog which would be a step forward

00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:39,630
in this respect this is of course why we

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:42,300
should have all packages and get that's

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,070
what what I was about to say it's

00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:47,010
probably easier to track email addresses

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:51,090
from email from emails in the in the

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:54,270
kids changes and but not everyone using

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:56,610
it how are you a song maintainer and yes

00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,740
sure but I mean if it is Co maintained

00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:07,679
it's most probably on a Lea so plugging

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:10,500
in there it's probably became for about

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,410
tracking activity with git commit logs

00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,130
you import upstream sources upstream

00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:19,440
becomes they've been developed

00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:22,260
plus the change log is signed by the

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,210
uploader at some point so that we can

00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,400
trust that information much more than we

00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,400
can trust get stuff because on

00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,390
collaborate I could commit anything in

00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:36,240
the name of anyone in any git repo

00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:38,760
actually at first them me and Daniel

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,650
Silverstone toyed with the idea of doing

00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,970
a white-hot operation against color

00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:47,760
blind which maybe DSA are not happy with

00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:50,429
but it would be fun to add to every git

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:55,290
repo in collab means a field in Debian

00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:58,320
control saying X unchecked uploads :

00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:02,880
true and see how many of those end up in

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,650
the archive at some point I don't think

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,240
DSA would have a problem with it the

00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,130
obvious admins might be have a problem

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,960
with it it's it's important to have

00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:13,309
enough sets of hats that we can

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,309
distribute around everybody

00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:43,540
okay what I was saying is we probably

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:48,010
should take notes so get tracking it's

00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:49,780
not a good idea so far the only the only

00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:52,780
conclusion we reach is a use of

00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:54,240
contributors which can Rico also suggest

00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,610
and it's a cool idea

00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,490
having the way to to to get feedback

00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:11,080
keeps on data private improve the

00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:12,250
tracking a running the tracking how we

00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,410
have another question there with the

00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:17,620
tracking what with what can we do with

00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:19,600
the with the teams sometimes we even

00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:23,169
find some teams that have been here and

00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,360
it's quite complicated goes there's two

00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:26,950
three people in the mailing list so not

00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,900
chances to be taken for example is there

00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:37,450
is a million in Analia probably need to

00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:39,520
be close or hungover to someone else yes

00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:42,130
exactly and then there's a few packages

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,350
out there which while they appear to be

00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,450
maintained by a team actually it's just

00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:50,650
one person they've set it up to get

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:52,840
around being noticed so of course if

00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,040
they go away even worse if it's not an

00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,260
ally off the list you've got no idea

00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:05,350
who's on that main - who is actually on

00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:09,490
my mailing list yeah yeah question for

00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:13,150
DSA do we have any way to track all the

00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:15,400
ones in alias I mean if I send an email

00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:20,800
to some developer if the email is

00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:22,810
bouncing up and says we currently don't

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,800
track that I think it would you know

00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:29,200
also it it's not that so there are two

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,740
sides of that there's the there's list

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,410
master which obviously does it for lists

00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:39,750
we don't currently do it for the normal

00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:43,170
Debian aliases we possibly should

00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,930
because last time when so

00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,940
yeah go with their the fairly large

00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:50,819
switchover over how we do the email

00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,799
routing on Debian org and during that

00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:55,740
process we discovered a few people who

00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:57,779
whose email like their debian or Gmail

00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,480
in the forwarding like completely didn't

00:35:57,779 --> 00:36:02,880
work okay there is a complicated

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,279
complicating factor there and that we

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,529
don't necessarily actually have email

00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:08,940
addresses for all accounts but that's

00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:11,099
something which I think we should draw

00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:16,049
the fix then say yeah that's a desirable

00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:20,099
property okay because we get sometimes a

00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:22,019
report and emails bouncing them so it

00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:24,390
will be easy and it will be a very easy

00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:26,970
way to trigger action from me and from

00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:30,329
them or whatever yes at least tracking

00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:33,750
not so pharoah's 400 500 or something

00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:37,019
yeah so the problem doing just simple

00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:40,619
dance tracking there is that some people

00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:43,829
will bounce their email based on it

00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:48,480
being spam yeah so people shouldn't do

00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:50,279
that but people still do it it I mean

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,549
you would get a good bunch of false

00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:55,980
positives so I'm not sure but it might

00:36:53,549 --> 00:36:58,380
be an extra data source so you can use

00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,450
it to verify whether all their emails

00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,670
are bouncing I mean we can we can detect

00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:06,750
that the percentage but I believe if we

00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:08,160
send an email and it bounced and then

00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,289
you also get your answer you can figure

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,230
out whether you know it says spam

00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:15,710
detected or it says like a kiss or

00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,710
unknown okay

00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,180
okay any more ideas

00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:33,819
yeah so if you want that then please

00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,650
follow a naughty ticket so we actually

00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:38,839
keep track of it rather than you know I

00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:41,420
standing here say yes that's a good idea

00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,880
and then I forget because there's a good

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:50,420
party tonight okay and nothing happens

00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:53,029
okay regarding the hijacking in

00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,369
orphanage I have one question for for

00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:57,589
for people in the audience has anyone

00:37:55,369 --> 00:38:02,150
taking packages and not notifying near

00:37:57,589 --> 00:38:03,529
like hijacking one packaging yeah I

00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,689
counted on that in the last couple of

00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:08,920
weeks and I haven't notified Mia yet

00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:08,920
okay sorry

00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:15,210
[Laughter]

00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:21,289
it should I don't know if the developers

00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:25,369
reference says that you should do so but

00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:28,420
if it doesn't then it should yeah it

00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:30,679
actually says you should pinkies in some

00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,640
section like beyond packaging or

00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,160
something like that I don't remember

00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,429
okay yeah I read that

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,989
Debra like when I became a DD 14 years

00:38:37,429 --> 00:38:44,029
ago and haven't really read it I'm -

00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:47,660
it's a so I will ask another question I

00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:50,769
mean how much manpower does the maa or

00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:53,630
QA team have in general at the moment

00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:55,759
exactly it's to make a point obviously

00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,609
we're all talking about lots of things

00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:59,959
that it would be lovely to have here I'm

00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:02,719
assuming also lovely to have would be

00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:03,920
manpower to make these happen yeah can

00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,479
you point to that for everybody in the

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,380
audience yeah I was I was actually

00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:12,349
planning to Eva call for help we were

00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,660
discussing with Ana also that right now

00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:16,969
a situation is quite complicated with

00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,630
the I mean it's confusing so if we want

00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:22,400
to change the way we work it will be

00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:25,689
better to have some people also to help

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:31,959
because currently we are only actively

00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:31,959
Ricardo Ana me so three people

00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:37,539
mostly Ricardo's in the job that day to

00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:40,630
day job and me as sporadically one week

00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:42,849
or whatever like this so bits of the

00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,859
mail team are actually Mia if we also

00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:51,749
have a little asking on the real deal if

00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:51,749
you are Mia inside the meeting and yeah

00:39:53,729 --> 00:40:00,239
and it will not be the first time I

00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,239
remember before some people have

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,670
okay thank you yeah we close early

00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,670
everyday

00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,829
