	00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:07,940
both problems these are statistics about

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:12,540
statistics and plans exactly

00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:16,470
okay great but you know there's there's

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,029
there's translation of messages of the

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,380
user sees every day and messages we may

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:24,359
never ever see wait to just have some

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,470
kind of it's a hard problem we have to

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,269
look at the desktop website what

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,099
actually matters

00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:31,380
you know narration that might want ya

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,280
basements it's good enough to make me

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,260
tell ya but seems like that should be a

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,780
pretty coarse grained qualification as

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,090
well the difference between 50% to 90%

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,070
matters the difference between 90 and 95

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,140
really doesn't mean specially since we

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,670
have a great team of translators right

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,309
now I mean we can already do this for di

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,680
we think we go in and we say well these

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,770
languages have you know translations

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,739
like 95% of the important messages or

00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,640
whatever and we figure out well you know

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,140
these ones

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,129
understand where I'm going to try to

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,170
offer them to use their music anyway

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,540
that's definitely counted that way if

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:23,150
you can't help things that way and then

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:23,150
Celeste what

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,850
or generation just software

00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:35,020
oh no no I'm I'm really interested in

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,490
the actual software itself the packaging

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,810
there's really very little of it that I

00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,659
think a user would see if they're

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,880
installing all this competition I guess

00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:47,240
the important thing is the actual menu

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,649
items and contacts all that kind of

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,300
thing and that's what I'm curious about

00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:52,630
so yeah if somebody wants to clarify

00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,630
that

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,880
so far you've not even you're gonna

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:09,019
initiate on my phone I guess you found

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:11,649
it sedation abilities as I will fix what

00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,649
your Savior

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,530
which I remember

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,660
the screen message

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,220
yes that is hope

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,110
but if you get it at that party stage

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:31,950
all over right

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,550
yeah you've seen today based on one's

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,550
specimen yeah that'd be nice

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:51,440
that's not a bigger okay so yeah the

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,720
other one down there media size which

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,030
some can of worms but I tried the worded

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,340
is to say does the city team happy

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,080
besides the live team happy with India

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,880
sauce I don't care what we do you dick

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,910
or what size they are I just it

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,920
up yeah with my display done for me what

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,680
we we need to be paying your decisional

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,110
isn't just does it fit on the CD equal

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,410
which particular image so I should

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:20,280
Russia or Panama and then it might also

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:23,640
be well we would like to provide a very

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:29,580
small CD often they might not be the one

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:31,950
that's the default you just get yes

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,960
in this context I think it's important

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:41,550
also to consider not just in terms of

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,770
physical media but also you know people

00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,780
who may not have such good internet

00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,740
access who need to get security updates

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,810
and maybe do net in schools so we're not

00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,090
just talking about physical the physical

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,260
restriction of a particular media size

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,540
is most a proxy for a bunch of other

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,410
costs that come with larger that sternly

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,410
response

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,810
could make further either

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,010
if you just mentioned that as because

00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,570
otherwise you get the objection that you

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,549
should be considering media size even

00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:20,630
without your downloaded or something

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:24,320
like that's difficult you wanna well yes

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:26,060
they told you and you know obviously

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,620
what you like wonderful people and is

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,030
new with you it won't be on miles

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,230
although with the days where don't

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,570
though we can deal with the exact

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:36,080
exactly yes

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:38,510
so yeah that's those are all the things

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,580
I've been able to come up with that I

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,310
can't with all of the unity that's all

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,610
the things funny moments in the one so

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,470
much more again ask Jerry says it is a

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,450
totally feasible for us to have multiple

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,400
debt reports depending on the

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:56,330
architecture depending on all your

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,250
information on live or install or the

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,220
size of immediate as people to possible

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,600
whatever is possible I don't just know

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,180
be convinced it's always a good idea

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,560
because it told me it does cause I need

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,740
to do these know down the road together

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,400
so it's possible the let's take about it

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,070
yeah I guess actually there is one other

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,210
thing that I can't love them I have been

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,910
thinking about which is something

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,889
mentioned in their message is basically

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,110
we want to have some kind of a

00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,110
continuity between releases if you can

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,419
read not changes it it's made you that

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,280
idea - there's so you know if it's on a

00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,350
big change anywhere from two to three

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,000
which I don't move into the matter

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,190
between state you live off from a

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
community perspective that you know

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,650
they're simply flip-flopping back over

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,870
into things

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,900
[Music]

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:48,000
yes and so maybe that's something to put

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,340
all their I can't think of much many

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,410
other topics of it on there so suppose

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:58,080
in the fall so going over me another one

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,300
salty naps the choice of desktop or

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,889
level HIC so nice I guess so I want to

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,509
be sunk down by the product on but yeah

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,820
I wanted to get this through this

00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,710
version save on every rating on

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,050
professional now let's say that you list

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,830
should contain the way support for non

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:16,680
system okay there are conventions we do

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,349
need their rights and also the long

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,539
system deal on a abuses people okay well

00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:23,099
we're it's on this is ke something that

00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,169
this including something that was a

00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:27,630
standing humans want this is the default

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:30,300
desktop in the people install RDS system

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,470
units so it's kind of a if you want to

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,740
install non-default that you're properly

00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:39,720
picking those up anyway aren't you I

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,599
would echo a related comment there that

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,030
the default isn't what everybody uses

00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:47,310
the default is web people who don't

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:58,889
necessarily have the experience or the

00:06:47,310 --> 00:07:00,870
knowledge to change the default and that

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:02,880
set of folks probably doesn't want to be

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,539
choosing a non-default it's done

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,060
carefully

00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:08,100
yeah we don't go if we don't move okay

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,180
thank you make a point

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:15,540
I haven't be but I have a second point

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,700
which is post installation flexibility

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:22,790
and configurability which is something

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:24,630
that it seems people do care about

00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,070
apparently there are you know I don't

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,390
really run any of these things but

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,980
apparently there are these people have

00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,290
used all this well you need up the

00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,620
desktop right so you said it's heavy and

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:37,050
I mean you know there's no spoiler yeah

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,250
arrange all your UI again

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,470
I mean there's there's nothing here

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,960
about how configured is a desktop how is

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,330
the word how popular is that US office

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,910
deserve these are things we couldn't put

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,670
on here I suppose that they're awfully

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,500
soft things try to get any kind of I

00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,760
know you can get a gut feeling about

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,710
them okay so in that case what I'm

00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,480
saying is please don't make this

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,920
decision based only on measurable

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:08,460
criteria because though you know that

00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:11,310
way night management so the problem here

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:23,700
is of me if we just go in the gut

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:29,400
feeling and if I go with one Apollo

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:32,430
material obviously so why couldn't

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,169
possible approach to this I to a

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,870
prototype wouldn't suggest that you

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,640
might use to deal with the problem is

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,340
explicitly list non-quantifiable

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,780
thinman's all your wiki pages things

00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,340
that will be taken into account but

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,350
which we don't consider measure

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,570
so we're not asking for a bowl for know

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,960
which I'm considering another thing you

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,880
could do would be to treat this page

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,890
Milius looking for that produces you

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,990
know like a acceptable limit set to

00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,000
apply and then choose some habits and

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,520
the remaining set if we get a set of

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,380
more than one items that are acceptable

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,070
then I think you're making a decision

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:12,180
that's made on some kind of other basis

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,550
because I mean yeah I don't think this

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,110
page really says how the state is gonna

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,020
be this is just data that I think would

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,240
be good to have and I think it's good to

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,710
get this get in front of as many teams

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,750
as you can really to do it somebody else

00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,089
or whatever I think the analogy to the

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,680
architecture requalification process is

00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:33,839
actually relevant here we're not

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,610
necessarily trying to write and pick the

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,620
best we're trying to say these paths

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,160
these don't exactly which ones actually

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,900
pass yeah yeah we don't have a concept

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,330
of which architectures are better than

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,920
others Lena's had once on FTP not in the

00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,570
Devi Network and what isn't

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,960
well that's actually true but we

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,960
certainly know processes in place

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:15,340
time to make my decision yeah well if we

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,900
put freeze or get by state they don't

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,370
going to be making a decision in the

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,310
next six to eight weeks

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,380
yeah so the negative exponent women take

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:27,580
us people the way to be able to have you

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:30,270
know documentation it was sort of a yes

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:34,660
tough so the sooner the better

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:37,390
but if I can find the time and start

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,730
building the teams during demo and get

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,020
their feedback then if you're thinking

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,850
what rate would like to get it all to

00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,960
produce statistics for graduation date

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:49,150
or something like that

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:55,570
yeah I guess we couldn't try to do that

00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:58,140
I I guess I'd rather do something I mean

00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,140
in Devon

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:07,980
also to the beach I mean since almost

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,980
all items are

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,870
[Music]

00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:34,129
although the factors should be more

00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,899
backdrops and we can act on things yeah

00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:39,709
I mean you can't generalize this to me

00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,610
and say it's something like you know or

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:45,110
something I just wanted something

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:49,550
specific because if anybody got some

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,930
other idea please raise your hand a lot

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,629
of those would fall under that first

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,819
category of packaging of doses have you

00:11:53,629 --> 00:12:02,209
know are see bugs or important bugs of

00:11:55,819 --> 00:12:03,649
business hardly broken right but some of

00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:05,720
the reward there should be able to first

00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:07,670
of all babies know such as packaging for

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,949
against maintenance do we have a

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,389
reasonable center packaging and main

00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:13,730
tendency keep it going

00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:15,740
we're i opposed to the protectable set

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,319
which is further down does it work well

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,089
with XY said yeah and packaging finally

00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:21,350
one you know the rest we maintain

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:24,319
routine before the cameras were all

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:28,059
nervous but yeah yeah i think you have

00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:28,059
to be kind of factory

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:09,500
okay the idea is that we make the

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:14,150
criteria that the desktop respects the

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:19,850
privacy so kind of deep talked about

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:21,950
really the message talked about how

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,760
they're working into that that I don't

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,829
know

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,779
don't really know how to want to buy the

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:37,050
capilla it's always hidden pull up

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:38,430
strings they're doing stuff you know

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,940
maybe in decision which things like

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:49,000
order not sending the users TSP server

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:50,770
right yeah I think if we do that we

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,430
should have a practicing section and

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:57,310
then basically a checklist and feel like

00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:00,910
disappointingly long but that's fine and

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,620
most be like within the proxy area what

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,530
how would you be is does the best not

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:14,770
back to do or not do that seems that

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:19,780
seems like the pain that also seems the

00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:24,160
problem with that is and university

00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:26,050
university is a really subjective

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,120
evaluation professional didn't we've got

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,760
the filing part about it if it happened

00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,920
to be true that Alex DB woke up one

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,650
morning and added LXE jelly every

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,230
application and our move user agent

00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:40,930
strings web browsers and so on and so on

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:45,160
no one with no probably certainly

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:48,070
nowhere to follow the bug sure yeah

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,700
well I guess we could go private still

00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:54,910
the table for us suppose personally I

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,950
would advocate a big Republican base not

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,350
the number of different axes there from

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,870
affirmative efforts to improve privacy

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,280
to just don't have any crazy bugs I'm

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,230
wondering it rather than making it a

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,490
cull of eighth row in the table which

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,500
would be just put it under that so

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,960
here's some soft criteria we should

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,360
consider yeah I don't think we have a

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,040
part of one viable ways to talked about

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,050
which desktops are more private than

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,020
others or you can sort of the main

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,910
channels I'm sure but that checklist is

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,620
going to look a lot more like here are

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,030
the features this desktop is working I'm

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,700
sorry if he knows that desktop is

00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:30,400
working on that's Harvey Kynaston

00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:32,260
checklist it's the exact like you anyway

00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,970
use and some what that technoServe

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,970
something like looks like you know more

00:15:47,720 --> 00:16:15,959
we have a prime seat even today so I

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,990
have a question from IRC from Twitter

00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:21,750
evangelist them oh yeah he's asking how

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:25,290
about making it easier for the user to

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:28,490
choose among these day stuff so I guess

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:34,260
yeah there's none of the other things

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:35,880
here I I do want to get to that better I

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:43,110
hope you didn't hear me and I'm sorry if

00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:45,660
you can't but like I said yeah so yeah I

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,519
guess we can go ahead of them this is

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,230
baby before I go down it's fun that it's

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,449
basically makes sense anyone is there

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,949
any way this doesn't make sense to who

00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:54,949
thinks there's some better way to do it

00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:06,060
and the possible ways you know you have

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:09,240
a youthful way to do good Jeff felt that

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,339
if I was totally but it made sense in a

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,900
way of working and other to be honest if

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,670
there is anything that any of the

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,410
various tennis club teams think is

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,360
really important to them and we kind of

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,040
thought of them though is scope for them

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,280
to at least give a subway the most of

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,870
the pages are we can summarize and work

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,060
through it later but we need to have a

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:29,810
central place which in the data that's

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,810
exactly what this is

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,730
at the risk of being mildly

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:40,250
controversial is it worth taking a straw

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,250
poll of the room about choices

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,980
no I'm a citizen so just like I decided

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,440
ask to seek the idea to be honest about

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,360
you suppose we know this route is so

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,390
selective already the very hand of you

00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,600
know I will personally vote all the best

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:08,190
optical lithography one especially those

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:11,210
like biology every country is

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,210
specifically beautiful

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,390
and this will be able to choose from a

00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,070
set of desktops that material yes we

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,500
will find out if any of the based on

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,570
personal dimension or clearly not

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:04,650
suitable for some reason that we may not

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:06,450
get repaid with deal well we will assume

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,040
you know the great stock with you chosen

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,840
to be honest is crazy

00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,790
basically that people was probably less

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,530
tops we haven't yet listed you know what

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,600
and give us the information on here

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,800
it'll tell us enough information to say

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,530
is it worthwhile

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,940
Jerry made various other people put in

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,250
the edge record they came in to make

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,250
sure the next CD value to those people

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,930
know what kind of thing if this is all

00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:38,570
useful information before release so

00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:38,570
let's have it please so many

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:49,860
because disability' main wants to

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:52,530
pretend to become irrelevant

00:19:49,860 --> 00:20:00,020
meaning something popular we will

00:19:52,530 --> 00:20:05,090
dispatch at least something be able to

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:15,299
you should have what you should provide

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:17,700
other features I would rather just say

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:19,549
anything that is commonly accepted in

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,159
some kind of a desktop environment

00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:25,029
generally thought to be broadly in a

00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,639
piece of

00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:30,009
consider these a solution that we may

00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:31,959
have published by this again

00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:34,509
are there be some he doesn't want to say

00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:37,359
Piper I'm advocating their field to a

00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:40,209
desktop but I think we have all the bits

00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:47,049
needed let's again was we let's talk

00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:54,779
about it yeah okay yeah found doing this

00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:57,119
every stable release this Casas things

00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:59,589
so I'm gonna comments on that is it okay

00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,329
if we think this is something which is

00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:03,899
mainly for the benefit of people don't

00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:06,849
know wallet deaths of the violence's and

00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:08,109
every stable release legally come you

00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,639
say like that right you know becomes a

00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:17,379
different decision yeah I'd be kind of

00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:18,609
serving with someone who it could be

00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:20,859
something which is less explicitly

00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:22,899
consumer yes the transition between the

00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:27,399
previous one in this one it was quite a

00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:29,349
disturbing one or not yeah yes

00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:30,279
consistency you're gonna have it thank

00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:32,769
you

00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:36,609
so yes so okay so I think we're about

00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:42,399
done with this page let me talk about

00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:45,159
desktop choice in task self so currently

00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:47,879
tests all when it comes up in the

00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:54,119
Installer has ten items in the menu

00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:54,119
which is a maximum

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,560
because you know overwhelming 222 round

00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:05,920
remembers or a thousand choices with

00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,690
your attention responded yet we used to

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,050
tell people is deselect at the end of my

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,640
schedule also paper um actually I've

00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,920
actually considered improving some of

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,330
the items from that very often use and

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,280
now that we have tasks elvatyl with

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,690
makes you say well this many people

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:24,870
choose a boxer which is actually

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,870
surprisingly large younger people but

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:38,170
sorry you can say yes that's been that's

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,550
right so what I what I do feel

00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,520
comfortable about this having like he

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:47,170
wasn't got an escape hatch to say over

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:49,270
anymore so the problem is it's meant

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:53,380
that in the constraints of di is kind of

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:55,740
annoying because using comp and the

00:22:53,380 --> 00:23:00,820
current menu items a multi-select list

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:02,560
so you I wouldn't mind having a mortar

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,580
at the bottom of it I'd be graded or a

00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,010
button but

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,500
that poem can barely do with custom

00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,930
buttons so it would have to be the menu

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,640
item saying or you pick that and then

00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,070
you're pumped in another screen that has

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,430
probably all the main desktop

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:26,790
environments listed here and also blends

00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:26,790
and whatever which and that was 10 or 20

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:41,230
so there are some technical problems

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,180
with that because the user may have

00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,500
selected a desktop environment first and

00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,180
they may not have in this is going to

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,490
influence what the what's selected in

00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:54,760
the second list and also were close to a

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:57,970
release of all was translated and assign

00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,970
a task tell isn't we've done this in

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:03,370
mind so I don't how to do it so you may

00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,980
be known for Jessie Jessie a wool

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,110
flexible necessarily they would be

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,390
waiting at lease and becomes somebody

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,250
wants to work while of course it's

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,920
totally like it are some things too late

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,180
Jesse wants to work when I need also

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,390
think never been observed in tech

00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:23,100
reports open for 13 years

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,100
watch my review stuff

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:32,050
you know yeah there's a completely

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,000
separate discussion for a different off

00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,640
about whether it be I should perhaps you

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:43,390
stepped up as a backing store for and

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:58,870
not live but yeah I mean this more thing

00:24:43,390 --> 00:25:00,240
it seems like it's probably something we

00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,770
should do as well as actually go through

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,460
the existing set of taxes when she saved

00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:08,770
what we worth slowed it down and then

00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,630
definitely also I mean these are things

00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,340
we should be reviewed regularly but they

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,920
never we never get Lance number till

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:18,700
we're going to release is work on what's

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,500
in those calluses you know the father

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,780
attacks for a very long time was

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,530
included Apple talking so but frankly

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,530
let's please

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,600
yeah the if you look at the number of

00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,910
changes in tasks all over the pass ball

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,780
since January it's been two changes and

00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,040
it's pretty absurd

00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,690
really

00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,610
that seems worth asking explicitly if

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,740
someone wanted to come help to figure

00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,900
out what should be in cast desktop or

00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:55,010
tasks something else where would be the

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:56,780
police volunteer here at Queen's okay so

00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,400
the deputy things because I think that

00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,980
people think were the people who can't

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,100
have about the most worthy minded

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,780
analyst you know the we get a lotta bug

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,490
reports saying change this or change

00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,280
that this kind of more thoughtful figure

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:17,590
out what the question makes sense you

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:17,590
know that way so if you're you know

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:31,210
all the places persuasion supply the

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:32,470
change in family I guess so yeah if

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,840
somebody wants to hack on the more

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,820
button the for item you know it's just

00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,710
for code it can't be that hard

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,470
accepted like that said it has a few

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:44,950
blank walls now a full foam about the

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:46,210
more options in taxes l is right down to

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,930
the bottom of this let's defend with

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:51,970
media I've seen discussion before the

00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,710
various blends people think yeah yeah we

00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:55,210
want to all get into so everywhere

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,290
better deal here's the thing I mean they

00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,290
all get in that doesn't mean they're

00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,880
almost exactly with us so it might be

00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:04,870
yeah you can pick up and staff you can

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,120
pick W science for something this is a

00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,980
big deal for any abilities fiercest me

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,900
one in other use cases you can want to

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,610
have the separators to be in the attic

00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,950
say if so that's one of the things that

00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,410
we've done for a long time is and it's

00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,630
typically that's a lot of our effort of

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,490
approachable east is trying to make sure

00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,680
that the things that tests are those

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:27,160
things are the Portland market or taxes

00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:29,470
all fit on the first season of the first

00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,990
DVD however you wanted whatever you want

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:35,140
to targets if we do start adding a lot

00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:37,690
more potentially way out there packages

00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:39,670
which the blends people are very keen on

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:43,240
both maybe not everybody else in the

00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:44,620
whole dish but once you know the content

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,840
of the first CD is dead

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:55,480
yeah I think I said the first DVD I

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:57,840
think we make sense we do have a concept

00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,840
of

00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:06,049
essential tasks yeah non-essential tasks

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:08,210
for example when we come to checking

00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:10,039
sizing things or we will make sure that

00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,919
we put all the essentials of a

00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:15,259
particular task on at first and then we

00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,259
fall back to essentially recommend later

00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:20,210
yeah this is a very hard thing to do

00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:21,679
depending on the people who come

00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,019
together the metadata in the first

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,179
places they have all the information to

00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:27,919
say well actually this won't be

00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:29,359
recommended but without all this data

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,509
you might as well not bother with the

00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,519
first set whereas for other people very

00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:37,700
much true that the recommends or suggest

00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:40,100
so luckily just sugar that really makes

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,230
things look prettier or we don't care

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:45,529
about in terms of making it it's illegal

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:54,649
right right the definition release one

00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:57,649
doesn't ask exactly and making the old

00:28:54,649 --> 00:29:00,100
fit recursively duties metadata that

00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:00,100
season

00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:24,320
yeah people pretty much out of time here

00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:27,740
whether this makes sense to be focusing

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,159
upon visitors oh you're saying for other

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,590
architectures yeah well I think the what

00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:41,419
was a keep your good Steve already used

00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:43,309
xfce as I work also yes yeah I've slept

00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:45,919
it but what I mean I've elves yeah I I

00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:48,650
think that that was our case previous

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:53,690
release and I think there's some extent

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:55,610
it's you know wants to have this

00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:59,320
information they can say all the rooms

00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,320
to move we support two different things

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,380
it's entirely feasible for the default

00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:11,330
sets all in store we hit

00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:13,640
Desktop architecture but yes it's

00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,470
possible I don't necessarily like the

00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,929
idea because they're weird or with our

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:21,289
release notes documentation that people

00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:22,730
look at then changes depending on what

00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:25,160
you're wanting to do or you know which

00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,840
which are potentially using that's hard

00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,490
we just need to make sure that we've

00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,470
been clear to people what's happened

00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,840
whether they're veterans because yes

00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,789
when you said that anything we never

00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,740
knew we shouldn't have tried out the

00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:38,740
phone systems so long pages of visitors

00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:48,870
I have another question comment from

00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:50,670
theta he asked if there should be an

00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:52,890
option to install Hardware specific

00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,930
packages depending on what hardware is

00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:59,100
connected to the machine like if you

00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:02,940
have a TB cards installed a TV of the

00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:05,670
change see the since we were getting

00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,130
into the water fluid advances although I

00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:14,730
guess you could say the task is I'm

00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:16,890
doing TV course someone posted a project

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:19,530
to plan Academy and in Debian develop

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,180
I'll back specifically about that go

00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,190
detect all the hardware in your system

00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,620
and find the appropriate sample better

00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:29,370
understood great eason crumb or

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,680
nice and proud that's the one yeah yeah

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,550
I don't know if it needs to be a taxi

00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:37,290
this understand their deficit or the

00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:39,870
previous that's like picked up on we are

00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,700
strand them and if they say in the SS we

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,020
install the stuff and we don't ask the

00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,220
user

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,220
[Music]

00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:56,389
I think that's us well it is probable so

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:59,549
I guess very last statement before we

00:31:56,389 --> 00:32:01,710
huge oiliness before we before you jetty

00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:03,690
because somebody doesn't need to make

00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:06,990
sure that this actually happens

00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:08,879
the main reason one unsure if I would be

00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:12,330
able work on the border of tasks that is

00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:14,039
to make sure this happens so what does

00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,970
on the truck send out emails from the

00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:18,890
teams

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:21,700
does anybody volunteers to do the vault

00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,929
accessing the task of selection things

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,100
[Music]

00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:26,480
because that's me at this is the main

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,830
way of making sure this happens and

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,600
we're not just having hot air in the

00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:33,170
room people I don't see any of you

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,850
around

00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:37,150
hi I'm Sherman sure as hell not

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:41,500
volunteering a lot to watch it already

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,500
if we enough nobody shows up

00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:48,840
[Music]

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,850
yeah yeah so it would be lovely to have

00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,830
this some of it if anybody's worth

00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,230
listening to the phone video was on our

00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:58,019
say all that but please start of a you

00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:59,909
know talk to us on Debian boots and will

00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:01,710
I'm gonna go with this we want promise

00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:03,710
that we'll be able to how many not sure

00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:07,799
we can definitely help review things I

00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,989
had the three DS currently stuck so what

00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:12,600
is that such hope I can relate to the

00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:14,850
IRC people there were quite another fire

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,730
see people looking at the stream but

00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:20,399
just down so what's what's the exact

00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:32,159
scope of the task oh that's a hard

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:36,059
question the idea those it's something I

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,679
think that these cover the task is what

00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:39,119
we've seen is what most could make it

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,489
possible when you're looking at a

00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,919
selection of tasks for example which

00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:46,710
desktop you install to be able to say no

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,929
I want something else bring on board and

00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:51,389
then Swedes added another have question

00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:53,249
moment and coming up with some kind of

00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:54,749
metadata the census on the four

00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:57,859
streamers on the main screen looks

00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:57,859
really obviously

00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,069
[Music]

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:10,879
there are any subtle bug reports and got

00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:12,740
some wealth with sickness police than

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,940
what you might actually tell procedures

00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,889
on kids and stuff

00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,889
definitely ago before you buy

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:22,580
as a short-term thing for Jesse for that

00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:25,159
matter if we review the set of existing

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,139
tasks and test excelled the 10 that we

00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,030
currently prompt about if it turns out

00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:30,679
there's two or three that don't make

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,649
sense anymore we could always have a

00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,889
default desktop apparent that you know

00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:39,080
work in your XFC hand and a few others

00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:41,359
I'm not as happy that because it comes

00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,040
back to wanting to have the default

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,399
things a test cell actually make sense

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:50,409
of assessment about those offices of I'd

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,409
rather not mention the layer of it

00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,650
okay I think we're gonna leave that

00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,679
amount of subject up thank you all for

00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,679
