I've been with the organization since

00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:07,700
2003 and I've been a WN developer

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,969
actually and my free as in spare time

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:15,870
since 2010 thanks to Zach for being my

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,180
Account Manager back then coincidentally

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,160
I started the FSF in 2003 I also first

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,220
started using Debian in 2003

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,920
so the two have always been connected

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,640
for me even though we have some kinds of

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,730
separation so I'm here representing the

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,219
FSF but I am also hoping to do some

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,050
Debian work I currently maintain two

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,969
packages that contribute very little and

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,100
maintain a planner for Emacs which is a

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,230
piece of productivity software and then

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,520
I maintain another piece of software to

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,289
destroy your productivity we'll just

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,230
called X word that's for doing crossword

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:57,899
puzzles small contributions but I always

00:00:49,230 --> 00:01:02,340
love being here project like so I

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:05,339
appreciate the chance to talk here today

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,540
and I want to start off by saying thank

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,159
you too often this gets lost and

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,720
discussions about disagreements but I

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,340
want to make a point of thinking

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,549
everybody here for all of the work that

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,990
you do to deliver free software to users

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,990
to promote free software

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,420
but even in the absence of that kind of

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,280
official endorsement or promotion we

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,100
need to remember that we have so much in

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,110
common and the FSF never criticizes

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,760
anybody for running Debian main on their

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,640
computer that's all free software the

00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,740
issue is solely about the ways to

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,220
promote and get new people involved in

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,840
free software while scaring them away

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,450
from non free software to the extent

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,830
that we can so we're gonna move through

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,910
this somewhat quickly because I want to

00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:03,750
make sure we have a lot of time for

00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:05,550
discussion at the end and then open it

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,899
up and for so I'll be here all week as

00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,550
well so I'd really like to meet with

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,750
anybody for the rest of the week who's

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,230
interested in talking about the issues I

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,640
raised or has any other ideas or once I

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,540
have any other conversations with the

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:22,860
episode so I think Zak and deal with

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,320
they demonstrated the need for us to be

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,730
talking about this the free software

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,050
movement I think has been growing I

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,310
think there's more free software users

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,260
than ever before I think there's more

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,030
people who have some idea about the

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,820
issues involved than there ever have

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,989
been before but we also have many new

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,510
kinds of challenges that we have to

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:42,180
address and threats know the issues of

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,410
services and mobile computing or you

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,209
know the growing importance of

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,690
technology and software as an actual

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:53,760
medium for protest and activism you know

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,739
there are especially not doing it for

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,420
the reasons that we do it and I think

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,900
both those talks yesterday to open the

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,980
conference really pointed to the things

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,310
that have kept us from working together

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,310
as

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,080
mentions Debian is an actual FSF

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,910
endorsed distribution but also

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,370
independent of that things that Debian

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,540
in the FSF can work together on

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:22,560
regardless of whether the first thing is

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:26,250
true or not so the F stuff doesn't have

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,570
a single official distributions that we

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,340
think are suitable for recommending

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:44,459
through the public for the goal of

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:46,680
promoting and actually conveying the

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,120
ideas along with that and growing the

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,350
movement as a social movement concerned

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,150
with ethics so the two most relevant

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,990
parts of the criteria that we have for

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,250
distributions to uphold those values are

00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:03,120
first a commitment to remove all non

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,040
free software and second a commitment to

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,269
not steer users toward non-free software

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,769
outside of the distribution so now I'm

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,560
going to say a few things that are going

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,390
to maybe sound critical but I want

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,769
everybody to know that this all comes

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,350
from a place of deep respect for what

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,580
Debian does I'm a Debian developer and

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,590
I'm not interested in standing up and

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:26,070
criticizing myself disrespecting myself

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:29,660
even at the behalf of my employer but I

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,430
think what we want here is for Debian to

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,440
focus more on the awesome free software

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,419
work that it does and possibly less on

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,470
some other things that have been part of

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:42,210
it historically so Debian is the

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,590
distribution that's the most commonly

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,320
used distribution that is the closest to

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,720
meeting the FSF's criteria and that's

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,430
because of the huge step that was taken

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,380
before the release of squeezed back in

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,950
2011 to remove all the non-free firmware

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:58,350
from the kernel and because we

00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,729
appreciated that and recognized how

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,919
difficult that is to do and what a

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:05,220
commitment that is we published a

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,190
announcement and did our best praised

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,660
Debian for taking that step and this was

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,400
an example of the kind of thing I want

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,840
to talk about later of this is related

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,300
to the endorsed distribution but it's

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,010
also related to the idea of small

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,990
cooperation on specific issues that we

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:24,330
can find reasons to

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,040
promote each other's work so and now a

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,650
list of the things that we see as

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,720
problematic for that archer of debian

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,550
now Moore seemed sure of Debian now as

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,960
it relates to our criteria and I can't

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,600
promise that this is comprehensive

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,610
but it's indicative I think this will

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:44,520
cover all the types of issues that would

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:46,940
come up so the biggest one of course is

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,140
is the relationship of non free and

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,060
contributes to the projects and Debian

00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,010
has an idea that those things are not

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,120
part of Debian and that's stated very

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,310
clearly in different parts of the

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,980
project documentation but in other parts

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,390
the distinction is not so clear so we

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,430
can start with the wording of the

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,570
commitment to non-free software not

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,210
support for non free software in the

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:09,090
social contract itself and these are the

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,250
three spot it's posted about this that

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,990
will support people who create or use

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,600
both free and non-free works on Debian

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,070
we will not object to non free works

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,470
that are intended to be used on Debian

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,730
systems and we acknowledge that some

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,370
other users require and on free software

00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:26,960
so we will support their use and provide

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:29,610
infrastructure for them those things

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,070
supporting is not the same word that we

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,960
use which is steering so the question is

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,330
when does supporting non-free software

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,500
like that become actually steering users

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,730
toward non-free software I think one

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,350
confusing thing about the wording of the

00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,810
social contract is the use of the word

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,390
Debian actually because Debian and the

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,550
social contract sort of refers to both

00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,040
and the same document the project and

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,360
the distribution and I think that

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,830
distinction is important when we start

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,120
looking at this closely because the

00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,570
criteria pertained through the

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,710
distribution and what a user experiences

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,570
when they install and run the software

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,800
when they visit the home for the

00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,600
software on the web to learn more about

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,010
it and that sort of thing those aren't

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,530
necessarily the same thing as what other

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:15,360
projects the Debian community might be

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:17,970
taking on so supporting and steering are

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,070
not issues for the first criteria which

00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,260
is actually shipping non-free software

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,960
you know Debian already is meeting that

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,450
in main there's no dispute about that so

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,310
this is really what we have to focus on

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,960
now this idea of supporting and steering

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,340
gets a lot of you know pushback because

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,669
some people see it as kind of sensor

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,680
ship or trying to hide things from users

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:39,240
inevitably obviously anybody can install

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,410
whatever they want on and on a free

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,850
software system that's kind of the point

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:46,410
and so we have to but I think that it's

00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,940
not censorship and we can see this from

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,060
looking at Debian which itself has kinds

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,889
of policies that set limits on how far

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,710
the project will go to steer users

00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,660
toward non-free software contributes you

00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,460
know seems to exist for largely that

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,020
reason every program even though it's

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,669
free if it's only purpose is to install

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,740
a non-free program then it doesn't

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,660
belong in Maine and I think it's a very

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,910
similar idea to what the FSF is talking

00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,850
about that if something exists in a

00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,860
distributions you very directly lead

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,280
users to non-free software that's not

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,810
something that fits in a distribution we

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,020
want to promote as an example of the

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,610
frequent and there's limits on ways the

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,070
packages in Maine can refer to packages

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,479
and contribute non-free what you know

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,620
what's where those package names can

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,570
appear and which fields in the control

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,830
file so I think what the shows is that

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:35,430
you know broad generalizations about

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,870
trying to filter what users see aren't

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,339
going to help here we have to talk about

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,580
you know we're already doing that in

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,539
Debian and we need to talk about how far

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:49,130
those things should go and what the

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:49,130
actual concerns are so I have a

00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,980
so the require material seemed to be a

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:04,129
bit inconsistent you can recommend you

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,939
can't recommend packages in non free but

00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:10,670
you can suggest packages and non free

00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:12,019
well if anybody user sees this that's a

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,089
suggestion to install the non-free

00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,379
program and we know that technically

00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,939
well what that really means is the

00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:19,160
package manager behaves a certain way if

00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:20,449
a certain option is activated but if

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,939
this option is if this information is

00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:37,639
displayed to a user suggest me and

00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:40,699
suggest results are in both non free and

00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,079
contribs which sort of you know to a

00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:43,220
user who's learning about debian for the

00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:44,509
first time certainly give the impression

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,759
that these things are part of debian

00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:48,800
there's text on the page which doesn't

00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,029
make the point that they are not but

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,220
then you do the search and a list of

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:54,079
applications come up some from not

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,089
afraid some from contribute a little bit

00:09:54,079 --> 00:10:03,170
but it gives an impression of

00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:04,670
unification I think the installer Walden

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:09,670
unfree firmware was removed from the

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,670
kernel we I know that people have been

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,449
but still you know wanting to direct

00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:19,490
users toward the non-free firmware in

00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:21,319
order to have specific hardware on their

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:25,550
system work and I know that's a really

00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:26,689
tricky problem but I think I think in

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,399
this case it has a lot to do with a

00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:30,949
manner in which it's presented and the

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,240
message that's delivered but you can

00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:34,189
imagine sort of defeats the whole

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,809
purpose if you just really encourage

00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:37,809
users to go install that software

00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:46,319
how do we actually you know turn that

00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:47,879
problem into an opportunity for the

00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:49,230
free-software movement it's where we can

00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,449
together apply pressure to get those

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,059
issues fixed rather than kind of release

00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,709
that pressure by continuing to lead

00:10:54,059 --> 00:11:01,079
users to the non free software to make

00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:04,410
the components work documentation is an

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:07,290
issue in some places so places like the

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,119
Debian wiki have everything all together

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,220
you know if you go through the

00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:13,019
instructions for doing different things

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,249
installing don't link from software on

00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,290
the front page of the wiki takes you to

00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:18,540
a page that lists different things you

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,949
can install and flash and non free

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,139
things are listed there right together

00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:32,489
with everything else you know it's a

00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:33,869
wiki I could okay thanks you know it's a

00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:36,569
wiki I could have just edited before the

00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:38,670
talk but I think it's a principle to

00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:40,889
think about what's appropriate for

00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,629
official documentation about official

00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:45,720
Debian you know to what extent should

00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:47,610
that direct users toward non free

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,139
applications especially when things like

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,959
flash probably you know aren't really

00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,189
you know they're necessary when people

00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,869
want to do certain things but in the

00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:56,309
grand scheme of things as Debian going

00:11:54,869 --> 00:12:00,799
to try to push the envelope there or

00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:00,799
just provide the technical instructions

00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,449
this is one that a that gets very

00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:08,879
complicated but I think it's also

00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:12,089
extremely important just made up a name

00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,740
for it today on stream do polls programs

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:17,279
that are in Maine but install extensions

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,799
there's a lot of them and if those

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,249
extensions are non free is that a

00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,669
problem

00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:24,660
and I think sometimes the answer is yes

00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:26,970
sometimes no and I think one of the

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,910
cases where clearly is a problem is the

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,220
case where the add-on extension

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,199
interface is directly is incorporated in

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,169
the program and you see this now with

00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,749
iceweasel if you click on add-ons then

00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:41,399
you get a in the browser not you know

00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:42,919
it's course loading over the web but it

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,160
looks like part of the browser interface

00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:48,869
display add-ons that you can choose from

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,209
and when I check this earlier today the

00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:52,799
very first add-on that appears and the

00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,360
list is one called

00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,880
Evernote clearly which is

00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,709
proprietary in fact just you know not

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,149
really related but the license is funny

00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,680
you are free to use Evernote clearly

00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:05,000
with any of the applications or services

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,380
offered by mozilla all rights reserved

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,800
that's a that's a short license to give

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,110
it credit but that's not free worse than

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,269
that the list the application yet on

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,160
does not have there's no indication that

00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:30,839
is proprietary and the iceweasel window

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:35,100
so i only found that you know oh it's

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:39,810
angled web we weave incorporating a

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,100
little proprietary things and i'm pretty

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,390
sure the other two on the top row were

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,600
also proprietary but i didn't click

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,730
through to check it so this is a case

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,050
where i think this is you know

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,160
essentially violating the principle in

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,320
addition to this specific problem is

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,670
violating the principle behind contribu

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,440
have a program which is a free program

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,360
but is leading to installation of

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,430
non-free software and of course add-ons

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,100
are an encouraged and suggested part of

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,930
using the browser so you know that's a

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,600
something that i think causes problems

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,250
for user freedom so we're working with

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,589
triskele one of the distributions that

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,440
we endorse on providing an extension

00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:16,110
repository for mozilla based browsers

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,260
that lists only the free extensions from

00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,699
the official mozilla location there's

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,959
been some conversation with mozilla in

00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:26,160
the past trying to get them to change

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:28,949
that and if you go to the mozilla add-on

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,630
pay library in your browser as you know

00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:32,940
type in the URL you will it will show

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,589
you what the license is weirdly that

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,199
information is not brought in to the

00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:38,880
iceweasel embedded you or the firefox

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,589
embedded view also it's not that helpful

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,449
because this license was called custom

00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:46,949
license doesn't really say it's not free

00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:49,260
and i think this is an example if you

00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:50,310
close these upstream do polls one thing

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,260
that i would really like to happen out

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,510
of cooperation with debian is for us to

00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,130
work together on fixing these problems

00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,140
upstream you know i think that

00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,959
regardless of whether we end up on the

00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,520
same exact page for what constitutes

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,750
steering and supporting users toward

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,430
non-free software this is you know

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,290
debbie and i think people would largely

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,029
agree that this problem

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,680
if we didn't have it and if we didn't

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:14,040
have to worry about it and I think that

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,870
coalitions of us working together can be

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,440
effective at achieving these things and

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,660
getting them fixed now I know you know

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,100
iceweasel is a web browser so you can

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,720
stop the extension library from showing

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,339
non-free software but you're not going

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,920
to stop people from finding non-free

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,139
software on the web people could even

00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,899
use Debi underwrite non-free software so

00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:35,550
it's not about blocking all possible

00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,170
access to non-free software we're not

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,300
trying to impose restrictions on users

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,519
what we're trying to do is draw clear

00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,690
lines about what we and may what we

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,790
directly enable what we directly

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,769
encourage steer and support users to do

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,569
and I think you know this is one example

00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,279
of a way to draw a line as is that

00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:53,250
interface directly embedded in the

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,779
program if you had to go to the Mozilla

00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,370
site to install a proprietary add-on

00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,560
that's a different thing that's just

00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,730
like going to any other webpage that's

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,430
an argument we would have with Mozilla

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,199
not with Debian other programs do do

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,180
better and Debian main libre office

00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,759
their extension repository is actually

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,680
all free software so this type of thing

00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,850
is possible and widely used popular

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,870
programs and it's something that I think

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:18,360
we should work together to get changed

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:21,269
so that's kind of the quick lists of

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,449
types of issues and I think they all are

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:27,060
going to take a lot of thinking to go

00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:29,910
through we set up a mailing lists for

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,860
this quite a while ago and I completely

00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,940
my responsibility my fault for dropping

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,130
the ball and moving the discussion

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,470
forward then but I think it's important

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,699
that we start it back up again and we

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,370
have that mailing was still there for

00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:43,500
that purpose and I want to make clear

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,120
that we're not just asking Debian to

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,449
change I think that I want to engage in

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,399
this dialogue because I want to see ways

00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:52,079
the FSF's criteria can be made better as

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,550
well and I think that conversation about

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,680
the issues can lead to that you know

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,790
these aren't these criteria been around

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,779
for a while and we have distributions

00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,760
that are meeting them but we're always

00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,680
seeking ways to improve them make them

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,880
make more sense as a strategy for

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,130
promoting what we want to promote then a

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,169
few big questions here just to think

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,319
about is there any kind of victory

00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:15,120
condition within Debian for removing non

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,760
free software from the social contract

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,669
you know what would be in what world

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:25,189
would you as a Debian contributor

00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:41,039
user think would make non-free software

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:44,850
unnecessary yeah yeah so I'm gonna well

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,350
answer these questions together here but

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,870
not free it is not very big right now

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,880
all right it's quite small actually so

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,120
what is the point and then it took us

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,380
another thought experiment to see how

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,779
intrinsic the notion of supporting

00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,860
non-free software is to Debbie and

00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:04,200
Debian's goals and really is that you're

00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,269
just WM need to support users who have

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,679
non-free software requirements and the

00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:09,779
way that it did when the social contract

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,669
was conceived given that there are now

00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,470
so many other people happy to take

00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:16,559
Debian and build non free stuff on top

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:20,639
of it you know that wasn't the case back

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:25,049
when when Debian was started was it mean

00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:27,649
for the Debian trademark policy if non

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:30,809
free and Katrine are not part of Debian

00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:33,330
then is it okay for our company to sell

00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:36,210
a server with the Debian trademark and

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,679
the compatibility section when operating

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,039
that server requires installing software

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:44,000
from non free contribute a cat

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,529
repository with riot area software I

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,730
think you know I don't I did read the

00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,510
trademark policy it doesn't address this

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,850
question and I'm not actually

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,350
recommending a change to it right now

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,620
but I think thinking about that because

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,940
that's often a point of disjunct having

00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,440
this conversation is what is official

00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,730
Debian we have our interval definition

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,769
and we have how it's perceived at the

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,049
trademark policy is kind of a definition

00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:06,059
of what official Debian actually is when

00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:07,019
you are allowed to use that mark so I

00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:10,139
think that can be an interesting way to

00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,580
think about this likewise another kind

00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:13,710
of thought experiment how do you support

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,370
the user who only wants to make one

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:20,490
decision once that they only ever want

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,289
to use free software right so the

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,630
iceweasel case is not serving that user

00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:26,010
well because that

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,860
iceweasel is presenting them with

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:30,120
non-free software without telling them

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,350
and giving them the option to install

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,680
that directly from the program that they

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,590
got a Debian main

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,150
so we worry a lot about you know making

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,800
life difficult for the users who need

00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,690
non-free software who want non-free

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,870
software but let's also worry about the

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,670
users who want to use only free software

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,290
and only want to make that decision once

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,480
and not have to be constantly on the

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,850
lookout for what programs might be

00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:59,260
prompting them to install and how can

00:19:51,850 --> 00:20:00,820
that decision be made so that's the

00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,860
endorsement section and this I'm just

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,200
going to go through quickly because it's

00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,470
the brainstorming lists and I'm hoping

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,300
this is a lot what we can talk about

00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,430
these are things that we can do together

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,140
regardless that I have thought of and

00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,580
would like to discuss regardless of the

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,050
status of Debian as a distribution that

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,320
the FSF actively encourages people to

00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,270
install or not the FSF has been has a

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,040
free software directory which lists our

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,630
goal is to list all of the free software

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,640
in the world that runs on a free

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,440
operating system also can run on Windows

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,980
or Mac but as long as it runs on a free

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,360
operating system I recently a couple

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,550
years ago we converted the directory to

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,780
MediaWiki and we're doing it with

00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,210
Symantec MediaWiki so they can provide

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,070
machine readable information about all

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,320
of the packages including licensing

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,150
information dependencies that sort of

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,340
thing we've been working on importing

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,460
packages from Debian main and we've also

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,660
been working on mirroring the category

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,760
system so that the semantic properties

00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,970
and the directory have a relationship to

00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,840
dev tags so you'll see if you visit the

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,900
directory you'll see a lot of familiar

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:07,470
forms like works with and uses and so on

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:10,900
and yeah so we would love to see

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,160
cooperation there and I think you know

00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,420
this would be an upstream directory

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,680
essentially so wouldn't just be a

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,400
duplicate of what's already packaged in

00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:20,650
main it would be main plus databases of

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,660
compatible hardware which is something

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:28,560
that I have been talking with Lucas and

00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,420
Zach about recently h node org is the

00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,830
free software foundation's database of

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,410
hardware that works with a fully free

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,840
system it's volunteer run but the FSF

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,340
hosts and supports it and this site is

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,750
different from previous databases of

00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,020
hardware because it's not just about the

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:46,030
hardware working on a linux based system

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,419
it's about the hardware working without

00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,379
work

00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:51,940
non-free firmware or non free driver

00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:54,489
previously the way that information was

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,929
contributed to the database we required

00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:57,850
users to run one of our endorsed

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,059
distributions because that was the

00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,059
easiest

00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,830
you

00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,190
shal debian resourced I think Debian

00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,500
could consider point

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,580
a useful resource in order to solve some

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,870
of the difficulties that users

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,130
installing the kernel without any

00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,720
non-free firmware and it might be

00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,680
running into you right now especially

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,690
people that are in the market for buying

00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,980
a new computer javascript licensing some

00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,540
of you might have read the material the

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,020
FSF have been putting out about this

00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:08,460
recently JavaScript's is often

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,020
distributed somewhere else as pretty

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,610
software but when it is delivered to the

00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,160
user and their browser it comes without

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:18,150
any licensing information making it

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,010
therefore by default proprietary and we

00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,570
would like one of the ways to address

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,310
this could be in the packaging system

00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,720
you know we're actually working trying

00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:27,690
to work with individual sites right now

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,160
to add license notices and we have a

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,600
format for that called JavaScript web

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,490
labels which is both machine readable

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,290
and human readable you can read about

00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,500
that on the news out of Oregon the

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,610
JavaScript traps section I think that's

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,380
something that Debian could think about

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:45,210
doing for packages that contain

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:47,520
JavaScript and whether you know profile

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,170
licenses have been sort of optional in

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,360
the past but that's because those are

00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,220
programs that are compiled if you are

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,320
actually serving Java scripts to a user

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,290
as an individual thing then those debian

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,420
meats ask that those files have license

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,620
information in them there's lots of

00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,630
other licensing work we can probably do

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,070
together we're both FSF and debian very

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,410
concerned with free software licensing

00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,690
the FSF maintains a couple of staff

00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,790
people whose job it is to help the free

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,370
software community with licensing issues

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,900
I know Debian has plenty of experts with

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,850
a lot of experience in the Debian

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,290
context also but I want to offer that if

00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,390
there we've worked with Fedora in the

00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,440
past to go over issues with package

00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,520
licensing and we would be more than

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,470
happy to help

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,740
Debian with that as well if there were

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:31,230
any opportunities to do so upstream

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,740
policy changes like I mentioned in the

00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:35,910
case of Mozilla upstream code what we

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,220
have the FSF has a high priority

00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:40,920
projects list where we try to name

00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,570
things which we see as real holes in the

00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,970
world of free software things and get

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,370
developed or improved and we're working

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:50,190
on revamping that list now so be a very

00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,480
good opportunity for Debian users and

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,290
developers to take a look at that list

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,090
and send us some feedback about that

00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,730
because we both have concerns about

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,470
upstream free software Debian users one

00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,809
things that aren't

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,610
because they don't exist they want to be

00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:05,919
able to have a Skype like experience

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,730
that works from the Debian installation

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,990
and that's one of the things that's on

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,890
the priority projects list so I think

00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,530
there's a lot of potential for

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:14,570
cooperation for us to call attention to

00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,690
code that needs to be written possibly

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,250
put resources into getting it in

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,809
coordination with Canoe of course we

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,270
have SEF isn't the same thing as canoe

00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:24,950
but we do a lot of the organizing work

00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,240
within canoe and if there are issues

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,190
that any of you have working with

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,320
getting your packages upstream then we

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,789
might be able to help improve channels

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,270
of communication and make that process

00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:36,409
work more smoothly that's you know we

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,240
talked about this at Libre Planet

00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,340
several years ago and the result of that

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,530
was that several new packages improved

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,169
to dead bugs and there's you know I

00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,549
think there was some other email aliases

00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:48,200
and such that were created so that

00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:49,549
communication about security issues and

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,500
other critical problems could move

00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:54,919
faster between the two between upstream

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,120
and packages privacy and security the

00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,179
things that were talked about yesterday

00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,429
I think that we both have a common

00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:02,809
interest in protecting free software

00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:05,090
users and there's a lot of opportunity

00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:06,980
there and then finally in a web

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,530
application packaging I know it's very

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,110
difficult and but it's kind of key to

00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,120
our future right now if we are a lot of

00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,070
the decentralized applications that are

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:20,150
being developed like media goblin-like

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:22,909
pump i/o our web applications and they

00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:25,190
require we want users be able to install

00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:27,020
them easily and that's what Debian has

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,850
always been great at is just taking free

00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,070
software and making it easy for people

00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,480
to set up I think that we would like to

00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,860
work you know especially on the cases of

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,210
canoe packages obviously but for

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,409
anything that addresses that need

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:42,620
because that's something that the FSF

00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:44,330
has been very concerned about as well so

00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,770
I have lots of goodies in the back there

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,330
and it's all some people taking them I

00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,409
brought gifts so hopefully I wouldn't

00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:52,159
get lynched

00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:54,530
there are bulletins stickers things back

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,720
there that you could help yourself to

00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,280
and if you want anything we have these

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,130
like special Guinea Linux and side

00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,990
stickers that are heavy-duty foil and

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,250
will last forever on your laptop they

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:08,899
come see me if you're interested in one

00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:10,909
of those as well so that's where I would

00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:13,179
like to start the discussion love to

00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:13,179
hear

00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:26,409
okay hi or repeat the question or the

00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,059
discussion comment cuz I'm not gonna

00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:44,709
like try to answer every my hope is that

00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:48,399
we can talk together right suggestion is

00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:53,709
that we should come up with some way

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:56,919
whereby it's easy when installing a web

00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:59,949
application to supply the source code to

00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:02,019
that applications users even for example

00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:06,219
if you're using a modified package or a

00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:07,599
modified module or whatever so you who

00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:09,369
look at that as a way of automatically

00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,419
complying with the a GPL but I would

00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:13,539
like to look at it as a way of

00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:17,949
automatically providing with the users

00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:20,879
with the right freedoms as far as we can

00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:20,879
with respect to that software

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,160
[Music]

00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,930
yeah I think so what you're saying is

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,010
that we won is yours a GPL legal

00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,510
compliance to another is you have just

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,010
the spirit of the a GPL which is the

00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:37,500
supply source code users whenever

00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:37,500
possible I think that's a great idea

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:50,260
so you mentioned the ideas in Debian

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:54,130
where we could possibly improve things

00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,500
in order to improve their working

00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,850
together with this of it

00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,120
one of the things I didn't mention is

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:05,710
that we do have somewhat different views

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:10,270
on freedom for example if I want to use

00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:11,650
make on a perfectly free Debian main

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,910
system and I want to look up their

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:21,270
documentation I won't be able to find it

00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:25,060
unless I go to non free is there any

00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:28,390
thought about moving the offensive

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:30,420
position on freedom of documentation as

00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,420
well

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,840
I think that that is something that

00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,920
could be on the table as part of a

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,150
conversation about if we certainly

00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,970
wouldn't let that be the last thing

00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:50,549
blocking cooperation between us I think

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:52,200
that's something that issuers in variant

00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:55,200
sections right it's not the GFDL as a

00:29:52,200 --> 00:30:12,870
whole so I think that that is something

00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:14,730
that we would discuss hi um sue this is

00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,630
more of a comment but first of all I'm

00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,660
gonna start out with something I think

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,830
is incredibly positive you you came up

00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,380
with something that I think is brilliant

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,210
important and I really hope was a

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,220
project can get behind which is that a

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,780
commitment to the idea that that people

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,630
should be able to say once I want a

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:36,270
fully free experience and get it and I

00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:37,620
love that as approach um because you

00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:41,640
know I think that is an important use

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:43,410
case um on the other side I actually

00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,730
don't think it's I think it's actually a

00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:49,910
statement that I I'm in the right place

00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:53,280
that you know Debian's not on the FSF's

00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:55,230
the recommended distributions list but

00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,679
yet there are other distributions

00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:02,280
downstream of us that do a lot more

00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,110
support of a non-free I really think

00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,059
user freedom is something that's very

00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:07,770
important to me not choosing for our

00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,690
users and letting our users do what they

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,820
want even when they disagree with us and

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:16,230
some of our users really want to not

00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:19,470
care about software freedom and one of

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:22,049
the reasons I'm here is that we we

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,400
support that that I can care a lot about

00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:25,770
software freedom we've said in this room

00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,650
we care about software freedom but we

00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:31,410
don't have to shove our opinions down

00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,309
our users throats and that's very

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,410
important to me

00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:35,730
in fact sufficiently important than if

00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,980
we were to change our position on that I

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:41,070
wouldn't be here and I think it's great

00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,350
that Debian can be a moderate community

00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:45,300
where some people who are very you know

00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,280
the FSF is very interested in software

00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,290
freedom it's not surprising at all

00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,890
some of our downstream distributions are

00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:54,030
very interested in user experience and

00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,680
Debian is a community where we can all

00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,450
get together and make useful forward

00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:12,300
progress and I really hope we continue

00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:13,950
that thank you and I you know I that's

00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,450
why I proposed that way of thinking

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,710
about it because I think it is you know

00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:20,850
like you said it's an important flip

00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:24,270
side it's a consequence of maybe going

00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:26,280
too far toward supporting just you know

00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,750
installing whatever comes along at the

00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,400
expense of people that do want to make

00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,020
that decision so I think if we went down

00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,270
that path that could lead to some

00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,620
interesting things and I think we should

00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:38,790
think about how that could be done

00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:40,980
technically and I did I meant to mention

00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,540
it didn't that you mentioned the non

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,430
free distributions downstream but it's

00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,140
also the free distributions that we have

00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:48,000
on the FSF list wouldn't exist without

00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,950
Debian because their downstream from

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,600
Debian and one positive thing that's

00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,860
happened last years is a bit more

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,080
communication between those

00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,520
distributions and Debian so triskele was

00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,830
one that's on the list and that's based

00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,020
on it 1 2 which of course comes from

00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,610
Debian and then the other Guinea sense

00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,810
which was originally based on a blue

00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,080
interior but recently switched to being

00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:08,580
based directly on Debian so you know

00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,310
that is one thing that's happening and

00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,290
that's why you know why I'm a Debian

00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:15,060
developer and and contributing to Debian

00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:18,960
because those things benefit the free

00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:21,420
software world regardless of what

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,330
happens within you know Debian proper as

00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,550
consequences of the work spreads out so

00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,580
I think that's a another area for

00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,360
cooperation is that derivatives

00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:33,140
downstream distribution work that's

00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,140
happened over the last few years

00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:49,059
if I can be sorry if I forgive me

00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:51,399
slightly contentious for a moment if you

00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:53,769
go to the FSF's page and look at you

00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:55,240
know so I want fine house I want to use

00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:57,909
free software how can I do this I go to

00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,389
the FSF page and all I get is a list of

00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:03,669
kind of niche distributions i buying not

00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:05,409
endorsing debian are you actually

00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:07,600
harming your cause because you can't go

00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:09,369
to the FSF's page and see anything that

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,980
looks like a mainstream distribution if

00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:13,089
you want a you know if I'm interested in

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,429
free software I'm not sure if it's

00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:17,470
something this may be for me or not

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,179
I go to the FSF's page and there's not

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,879
you know if I see Debian there I think

00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:24,339
I've heard of Debian that maybe that you

00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:26,379
know there's a problem there that by by

00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:29,280
not endorsing Debian you're you might be

00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:29,280
turning users off

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:42,919
that's well that's why we're interested

00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:45,019
in this right like we would love to be

00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:47,359
able to promote a distribution that is

00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:50,419
as well known as Debian and is widely

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,669
used as Debian I think that we have made

00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:54,649
things better and in the last few years

00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:57,049
with that list I think you know triskele

00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:58,009
I'm bummed because I showed up we did a

00:34:57,049 --> 00:34:59,900
lot of work right before I left to come

00:34:58,009 --> 00:35:01,940
here to do this presentation from one of

00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,089
the laptops that we recently endorsed

00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:07,519
s-- x60 running a libra boot core boot

00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:09,859
with all the blobs removed and I had it

00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,719
all ready to go running triskele and it

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:13,849
has a hardware problem so I wasn't able

00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:16,400
to use it but we run the FSF office on

00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:18,380
triskele lots of as most of the servers

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,489
run triskele and it's a distribution

00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:23,869
that really does work and so it's an

00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:26,509
issue it's not as recognized like you

00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:28,039
say but we have made strides and

00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:29,569
improving our ability to advocate

00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,249
actually installing a distribution

00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:32,779
according to what you have stuff wants

00:35:31,249 --> 00:35:43,130
promote but yes we would love to be able

00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:47,269
to have to bring these forces together I

00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:49,640
wonder if one way to what I wonder if

00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:52,039
one way to solve that might be to like

00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,749
even just if we don't endorse Debian

00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,479
maybe we could put something on the

00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:58,640
distribution page that said based on

00:35:56,479 --> 00:36:00,920
Debian because if I recall correctly it

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,690
doesn't say that so like if we could put

00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,430
just like a logo or anything there maybe

00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,360
we could get some more recognition in a

00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:09,409
more balanced presentation

00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,409
[Music]

00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:17,650
said I wasn't gonna take the mic between

00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:19,000
every question and I am but yes and one

00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,640
of the things that's been discussed is

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,620
is there another kind of relationship

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,660
status recognition that would be

00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,280
appropriate and something I've been

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,600
thinking about you know that the F stuff

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,940
would describe Debian in a way that's

00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,620
different from the other distributions

00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,170
that we don't endorse because Debian

00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,820
main does contain only free software so

00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,170
that's something I would love to hear

00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,000
ideas about I you know we haven't been

00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,670
able to come up with anything that that

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,320
sounds you know positive enough on both

00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,970
sides basically you know we don't want

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,070
to have if you wanted to be something

00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,840
positive but if we can't say fully

00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,250
positive and Debian of course doesn't

00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,530
want to apply a designation that doesn't

00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,910
sound positive for Debian so but I bet

00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,280
there's something there you know and I

00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,780
think I do I think we maybe can add

00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,800
something to the page about that I mean

00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,300
it's certainly something that we tell

00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:10,120
people all the time that those

00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:13,480
distributions come from Debian so just

00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:19,230
because you asked for possible ways of

00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:24,100
working it on the FSF site I thought of

00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:30,160
putting more use case related content on

00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:35,560
that that is okay so those distributions

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:40,930
are completely free but may fit only the

00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:45,370
use case of very motivated people those

00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:48,640
distributions are free enough that we

00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:50,620
would suggest them to people willing to

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,160
make some trade-offs and these are the

00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:55,930
trade-offs and trade-offs in favor of

00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:00,730
well dealing with many more use cases

00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:05,980
and if you want if you have use cases

00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:09,330
that are not even fit with that then the

00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:14,800
worst the least bad options are those

00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:17,800
that is if somebody gave you a very

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,640
proprietary hardware a very closed hard

00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,990
we have to work with well the best thing

00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:29,609
we can suggest it to do is to use

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:32,150
stuff because well it's better than I

00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:38,760
know running Windows on it

00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:42,290
and so in a way that would allow you to

00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,180
endorse more without compromising in

00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:48,060
freedom because it would be clear and it

00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:52,220
may also give you an image of actually

00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:58,140
caring for the work to be done because

00:38:52,220 --> 00:39:00,359
one way that FSF is perceived at least

00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,920
by many people who are very strong free

00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:06,000
software advocates actually that I know

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:09,180
is something that we we started to call

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,580
the Stallman paradox I have a dear

00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,260
friend who was like one of the biggest

00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:16,710
fears of their advocates in Italy that I

00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:19,290
know and she has this idea that whenever

00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:21,060
Stallman points out that the problem is

00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:25,099
usually right and whenever Stoneman

00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,099
points at the solution is usually wrong

00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:31,859
and for and I would I don't want the FSF

00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:35,609
to be perceived that way but I think

00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:39,089
that perception comes from unknown

00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:41,540
wanting to compromise on use cases which

00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:45,030
I do appreciate

00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:48,930
as far as a general long-term direction

00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:51,450
is concerned but it's not that useful

00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:53,970
when you have people that actually have

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:56,070
some some piece of hardware in hand and

00:39:53,970 --> 00:40:00,710
have some problem to solve and they have

00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,710
no choice along the process

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:12,140
I think the idea of some kind of sort of

00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,310
ranking system is really interesting it

00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,869
could be a good idea that might be a way

00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:19,369
to accomplish what I was just describing

00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:21,980
you know what it's really complicated

00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:23,240
question of getting people software that

00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,150
can work on the computer that they

00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:28,700
already have and I'm going to suggests

00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:30,970
that we focus on the question of how do

00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:33,710
we get all people buying new computers

00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:38,680
to buy something that works with only

00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:42,140
Debian main and only free software I and

00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,960
that's partly speaking as the as the FSF

00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,640
because other people were going to make

00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,400
compromises to make things work as

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,520
required now but there's a risk of

00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:55,250
confusing those compromises with

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,650
something that's adequate and I think we

00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,150
will stand where we are hopefully you

00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:01,790
know improving the way that we explain

00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:04,580
those things and come across but I think

00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:06,619
the question we can unify on is what can

00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,990
we do to help users that aren't in a

00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:10,940
situation where they can't afford well

00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,290
that's a question that's important but

00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,599
what can we do to help users that are

00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,800
going to buy a new computer and help

00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:17,330
them get the software because it's

00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,130
possible you know you can run I'm not

00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,420
running any non-free software other than

00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,740
the boot firmware and I have Wireless

00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,000
and a webcam and everything else with

00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,560
people a touchscreen everything else

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,930
that people want on a laptop it is

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,670
possible it's limited but if we do a

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:31,820
better options are limited but if we do

00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:33,320
a better job together of promoting that

00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,869
and encouraging companies to do that and

00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,980
we might get better results and not have

00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:39,849
to answer some of these trickier

00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,849
questions very much longer

00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:51,410
to extend on that just occurred to me I

00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:55,340
would love to be able to go to the FSF

00:41:51,410 --> 00:42:00,310
site and see some documentation on how

00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:04,280
to use Facebook which is sound silly but

00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:07,220
suppose that I'm a journalist and I have

00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,440
to publish on Facebook because that's

00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:13,220
the requirement of the media outlet I

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,670
work with then if I could go to the FSF

00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:20,030
and not be told you use Facebook you're

00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,630
wrong but be told use Facebook sucks to

00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,960
be you

00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:26,240
this is what you can do to make it not

00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,300
as bad there's a plug-in not to be

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,370
tucked that's how you make a backup of

00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,730
the content you publish so that that you

00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:38,270
still own your content somehow Skype

00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:41,300
whatever because we have lock in

00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:43,850
situations just denying their existence

00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:47,870
do not help the people that are locked

00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:50,870
in whereas providing ways of being aware

00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:54,350
when using it actually I think provides

00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:57,650
a benefit and a point of towards a way

00:42:54,350 --> 00:43:00,080
out but also a benefit because then

00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:02,510
using something being aware of it means

00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,570
not being bitten too much by it and so

00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,570
on

00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:13,650
is there is there a concern there for

00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:16,230
Debian as well

00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,819
to address and that's like when we're

00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,160
looking I think that's what should very

00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:23,220
its feedback for the FSF but what about

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:31,019
you know us working together questions

00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:35,099
like that I'd like to answer in Rico's

00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:38,670
point which is historically the FSF have

00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:43,319
not been that let us say that the FSF

00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:47,069
strengths have not lain in that kind of

00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:49,500
very practical user education and there

00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:52,319
are other organizations who have done a

00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,759
much better job of that and if I wanted

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,819
to know that kind of information I would

00:43:53,759 --> 00:44:00,480
look at the e FF the FF have done a lot

00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:02,819
of really good work at how to navigate

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,119
through a world of having to make

00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:07,950
compromises and to an extent I think

00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,869
it's slightly unfair to go to the FSF

00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:15,930
who's we need the FSF we need

00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:19,470
organisations who are very reluctant to

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:22,140
compromise we don't want to live in a

00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:23,880
world where everybody is is sort of just

00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,890
like muddling through it's good to have

00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:36,660
somebody who knows where they stand and

00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:40,400
stick to it how much of the big picture

00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:42,839
we missing Zac talked yesterday about

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,950
hordes of developers young developers

00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:49,680
not choosing licenses that's significant

00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:53,220
we're seeing so much of our computing

00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:56,609
move away from the the end device that's

00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:59,940
significant and to see the FSF kind of

00:44:56,609 --> 00:45:02,339
squabble over blobs I mean I understand

00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,019
the the need to be principled but it

00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:05,940
feels like we're missing a big picture

00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:08,220
and it also feels like we're not

00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:13,319
terribly united as free software

00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:15,900
advocates when we you know have such

00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:19,049
chasms that the FSF can't recommend

00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:22,700
Debian on its website it's there's no

00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:29,869
unity or fidelity there

00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:32,460
yeah I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:39,630
we need to unify we need to work

00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:41,220
together I think that that's a so we we

00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,859
do need to do that you know to address

00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,880
the big picture but I'm gonna you know

00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:47,130
say one thing which is I don't think I

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,349
think blobs are parts is a big picture

00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:51,119
now so we have hard drive firmware

00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:55,710
that's being exploited nor to spy on

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,510
users having a proprietary blob running

00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:59,039
in your ThinkPad that well not a

00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,359
proprietary blob proprietary system on a

00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,609
chip running in your sink pad that can

00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:04,440
communicate over the network without you

00:46:02,609 --> 00:46:06,779
knowing you know these are the types of

00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,779
things that the FSF has has pushed for

00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:10,859
always and it's been hard to persuade

00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:12,059
people that it's important but I think

00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:14,880
these things are part of the big picture

00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:17,490
now and I I think that it that Debian

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,869
should have a while Debian already did

00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,369
the right thing with the kernel but I

00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:21,930
think as it relates to other non free

00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:24,569
software and the risks that it is

00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:26,309
introducing users to in those contexts

00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:27,630
is something you know that should be

00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:28,589
thought about in light of the things

00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:31,589
that have happened over the course of

00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:33,180
the last year and a half but I agree

00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:34,710
with the sentiment fully which is we

00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,599
want to work together in every way that

00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,309
we can and keep the disagreements

00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,630
something that we can over the long term

00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:41,250
try to make progress on without

00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:46,770
obstructing the broader work that we

00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:48,779
share in common you said you have a

00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,880
laptop that you can run entirely free

00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:53,849
soft run except the BIOS as the obvious

00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,240
caveat this one the other one has a free

00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:58,440
BIOS but at the same time it's clear

00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:02,760
that there's probably some firmware

00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,529
embedded in there and you sort of it's

00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,049
it's clear that there's some firmware

00:47:04,529 --> 00:47:08,910
embedded in there and you mentioned this

00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:11,630
idea of it's adequate and we could maybe

00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:14,279
even recommend these systems to people

00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:16,109
is that just a sort of a practical

00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:18,510
distinction because we're so far away

00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:20,160
from having fully free hardware that you

00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:22,770
make this practical exception in this

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,140
case or is there some actual difference

00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:29,430
in ideology that that you honestly

00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:33,340
believe this is different some of it is

00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:35,080
just new stuff has come to light

00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:38,920
some of it is learning more about the

00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:42,520
way components operate and what needs to

00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:45,970
be adjusted in response to that some of

00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:48,280
it is decisions about how we can best

00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:52,000
push the envelope without not using a

00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,620
computer entirely you know but we are

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,060
you know every time we find a piece of

00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,100
non free software and something we will

00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:58,120
work to get it out and that's the same

00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,460
thing that we asked for from our

00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,740
endorsed distributions isn't you know

00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,360
stuff gets in there it happens you know

00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,220
what the ones we endorse but there's a

00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,800
strong commitment to address it and get

00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,390
it out and so that would be the same

00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,460
thing if we were talking about Debian as

00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:14,710
an endorsed distribution it's a huge

00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,450
distribution not expecting you to to get

00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,680
everything out all at once just to have

00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:22,360
a commitment that that's the right thing

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:24,820
to do for our we're the same principle

00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,490
because then making a psychology for I'd

00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:29,830
like to make a specific response that

00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:31,950
question so it seems to me the question

00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:35,290
is why do we make a distinction between

00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:37,090
the firmware that is shipped in a binary

00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,320
blob that came originally came with the

00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,960
kernel and now maybe it's in some

00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,000
non-free firmware package why do we just

00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,230
differ distinguish that from the

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,930
situation where the firmware is an

00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:54,130
EEPROM on the device is that your

00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:56,580
question why why do we tolerate non-free

00:48:54,130 --> 00:49:01,150
software in the device well there is a

00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:03,010
power imbalance if somebody can update

00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:05,290
the software and somebody else can't if

00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:09,120
the manufacturer have put the firmware

00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:12,100
in there and they can't update it then

00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:14,050
at the very least we're not any worse

00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,550
off than they are now although obviously

00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:19,330
it depends slightly what they programmed

00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:22,780
it to do to start with so I think there

00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:27,490
is a an ideological difference there

00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:31,480
and why do we tolerate firmware non-free

00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:36,250
firmware in devices at all well to an

00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:39,580
extent it's not really practical to do

00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:41,650
otherwise because the engineering

00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,970
solution for building a complicated

00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,420
system is to put lots of computers in

00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,420
there nowadays

00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,770
well I think that's one another area

00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,540
where when you're signing this all back

00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,890
to user security and privacy that that

00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,930
they have Debian could work together is

00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,579
on the question of secure boot and what

00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:59,920
we started calling restricted boot which

00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:01,059
is the case where you have a security

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,819
lock on your computer that you don't

00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:06,660
have keys for in the UAF five firmware

00:50:03,819 --> 00:50:10,140
and debian as far as I know hasn't

00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:12,940
adopted method for installing on

00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:15,730
computers that come with superior

00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,470
enabled by default so I would love to be

00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,760
able to participate in the conversation

00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:21,730
about how that gets approached you know

00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,559
where the FSF doesn't reject secure boot

00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:25,030
entirely we just want it to be under the

00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:27,460
users control that's kind of the

00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:29,680
definition of free software security and

00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,059
I think we need that the reason I

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,380
thought of that was because of the idea

00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:33,730
that this power relationship other

00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,780
people have the ability to modify it the

00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,040
software on your computer if you have

00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,290
proprietary if it's installed

00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:40,240
things like secure boot actually holds

00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:41,950
some potential for protecting users from

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,329
manipulations like that so we should

00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,619
think about not only how to get

00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:46,180
proprietary stuff out there but how to

00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:47,710
work together to improve to give free

00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:50,980
software security features the

00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:52,720
proprietary software doesn't have so I

00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,670
have a question that'll sound either

00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,290
defeatist or like control so feel free

00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,290
to just tell me you'll answer it offline

00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,830
you

00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:39,939
[Music]

00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:50,590
I'm falling down the rabbit oriented on

00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:53,410
the soffit better I had one last you'd

00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:55,210
say this actually continuum here you've

00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:57,940
got software one and definitely

00:52:55,210 --> 00:53:01,090
addiction is updated daily on the door

00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:05,200
at the far end you have something that

00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:28,060
can do computations from where falls in

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:30,970
the middle and all can say use this or

00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:34,630
don't do this because somebody has put

00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:36,460
it and I'm going to take me there that

00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:38,410
you don't know in function food and you

00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:41,200
can modify and you have none of the

00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:43,330
freedom that we are looking for so if

00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,500
you put some how far their plan for the

00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:48,920
way

00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:50,720
a lot of that so we go as far as this

00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,220
stuff of these tickled ourself we can

00:53:50,720 --> 00:54:16,610
sort of see where we do stupid stuff but

00:53:52,220 --> 00:54:19,240
we do back to use now over fitted food

00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:22,310
we did have a conversation about this

00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:26,960
last year so I came up with a final

00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:31,340
phase I think there was a consensus that

00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:37,880
so long as they we could weaken support

00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:41,540
this on architecture where the where the

00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:44,450
firmware will assist them firmware with

00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:48,590
authority on the system will allow you

00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:52,640
to replace the piece but if there was

00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:54,680
some system that was something some

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,620
platform that was designed to not

00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:03,530
support that that would there is dead it

00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:05,360
would not participate so we do so

00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:11,060
actually we do to give everyone wouldn't

00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:15,210
do this ticket they're up to

00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:17,010
there's a video TV and 327 furnished

00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:21,560
who probably be leaving as results

00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:21,560
continue on but will not be recorded

00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:39,589
if I was driving laughter I want to

00:55:36,979 --> 00:55:41,150
thank you for your work for that and I

00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:43,759
wanted to echo some comments that happen

00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:45,739
earlier saying that someone who sticks

00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:47,809
out the far end of the spectrum I'm

00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:50,179
sorry for calling it fridge I'm a

00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:51,919
supporter I'm very happy to emphasis

00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:54,799
they're doing that and I wanted to say

00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:57,049
also that your recent focus on security

00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,989
and privacy is critical and I'm very

00:55:57,049 --> 00:56:01,640
happy to see that as I'm doing that and

00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:03,799
the trade-off between security and

00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:10,039
privacy and software freedom is not a

00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:12,049
trade-off is two pieces of non-free

00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:13,339
firmware and you don't know which one of

00:56:12,049 --> 00:56:15,289
them has a thing that's going to make

00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:17,390
you more vulnerable and so the question

00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:19,130
of which do you do you're sucking away

00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:21,589
and the episode has been pushing for a

00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:23,539
long time for the security and privacy

00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:25,459
of the users and it's now exclusive and

00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:27,380
I really appreciated that because free

00:56:25,459 --> 00:56:29,419
software and firmware and feedback

00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,559
record figure CPU is the only way they

00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:32,479
were gonna be able to active attack

00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,660
against the kind of attacks that we're

00:56:32,479 --> 00:56:34,660
