	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
it's four o'clock up next we will have

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:16,980
Zach be presenting debian in the Dark

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:20,250
Ages of free software can you hear me

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,050
better so hello everyone welcome again

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,750
to that come for us it's a great

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,240
pleasure to be back again it's someone

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,740
Deb combs and a great honor to be doing

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,230
one of the opening talk

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,329
I confess I wasn't really expecting that

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,309
honor I just wanted to propose a session

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,980
which was supposed to be a kind of self

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,170
head session for those of us that think

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,210
that there is there are some worries to

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,040
be at about the where difference often

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,649
movement is going in general and the

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,879
role that mr. Bhushan have to play in

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,010
the current state of affairs

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,379
so this talk will be about a couple of

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,840
journeys at once so the first journey is

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,030
sort of a journey through emotions for

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,340
good feelings about what we have

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,920
achieved in free software over the past

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,629
fifteen to twenty or thirty years

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,670
depending how long you've been involved

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,650
and the second journey is essentially my

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,320
own journey through software freedom

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,270
from the day I started discovering free

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,890
software and what I've ended up doing

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,860
since then so starting with the positive

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,130
news so this is how I this is how I got

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,689
involved myself in free software in 1997

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,830
I understand that there are people in

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,380
the room that would have been involved

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,970
since way earlier than that other that

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,220
have been involved since way later than

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,380
that well that's my story I hope you'll

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,170
find restaurant points with your own

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,630
story and when it started as a freshman

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,070
in a computer science class in the you

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,890
versity of the University of Bologna

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,350
that was a huge tipping point a huge

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,020
high point for the so called open source

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,570
movement that was the year the very

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,880
influential essay by Eric Raymond has

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,350
been published that was the year well

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,930
actually a few months earlier than

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,090
Netscape decided to open road it's its

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,590
own code and that was the moment in the

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,079
history of free software where people

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,509
are trying to to sell to the industry

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,239
what free software was doing and I'm not

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,979
using that word in a cell in a bad sense

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,330
so there was reasonable concerns that

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,640
without the involvement of the industry

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,360
we software movement with an Evan got

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,430
far so they were trying to tell about

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,280
free software in an industry friendly

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,530
way so essentially the rhetoric at the

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,970
point was that if you do development of

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,980
free of software in the free software

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,930
way in a more open way in a more

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,240
participative way you will end up having

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,310
better software and that by merely

00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,410
opening up your code you will have these

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,490
flocks of programmers coming to your

00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:45,040
project and end up helping you so a few

00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,290
years later I realized that I personally

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,090
didn't believe much in that idea it's

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,310
not that only because the software is

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,340
open is going to be better but it was a

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,590
fair thing to try at the time what I

00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,540
discovered a bit later is actually what

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,610
stuck in me was essentially the the

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,910
philosophy of free software the fact

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,560
that computer user should be in charge

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,150
and in control of their own machine that

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,920
should have some basic freedom so you

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,170
all know about the four freedoms I'm not

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,090
going to I'm going to read them here but

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,400
my personal point is the years that the

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,990
way the narrative of the software is

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,450
something that resonated with me a lot

00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,370
at the time as a student I realized that

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,750
by having free software at my fingertip

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,360
as a computer science student I could

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,550
debug any single layer of the software

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,980
stack and look at how things are going I

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,690
didn't have to trust the teacher on how

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,520
the operating system should be developed

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,250
I could be a I was able to open up

00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,080
scared see in the Linux kernel and have

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,300
a look at the actual scheduling

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,760
algorithm that wasn't being implemented

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,040
in a real colonel not that I really draw

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,070
all of it at a time but the possibility

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,430
was just breathtaking for me and later

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:53,230
on I ended up distilling the main

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,910
intuition of his software which is the

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,950
one I used to explain for software to

00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,010
people which is the intuition of control

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,530
so I ended up believing that the main

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,290
reason why I've been involved in this

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,790
moment for about 15 years is that I you

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,370
really believe that every single

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,190
computer user and that's a lot of people

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,290
this day should be in control over their

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,540
own computations so everything you are

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,250
doing with a device which is mediated

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,650
via software is controlled by someone

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,720
either it is you or it is someone else

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,220
and the best happies of the best

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
narrative to explain that to people that

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,070
have been using for quite a while is

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,230
this passage

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,150
the novel makers by Cory Doctorow region

00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,920
is a bit long so I'm not gonna read in

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,380
detail but essentially there is one

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,240
character of the novel which is Lester

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,700
which is explaining to another character

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,650
the importance of controlling your own

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,840
devices your own tools and the first

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,480
example it takes is example of a hammer

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,030
a physical hammer and he goes on saying

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,380
that if you own a hammer it's not sure

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,140
you could do whatever you want with it

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,280
you can use it for its main purpose or

00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,560
you can use for something completely

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,880
different which was not meant to be it's

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,580
original purpose but it's you that

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,130
decide and it compares that with run

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,290
device which is the business in a box in

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,570
the novel and it is named this book is

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,540
the the big the evil villain which is

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:13,270
oppressing people and essentially Disney

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,670
in a box is a glorified 3d printer that

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,430
can only print that can only print what

00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:22,060
Disney wants it to print for that day so

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,640
one day it will print a goofy character

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,830
another day will print Donal that but

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,630
it's not you who decides it's Disney

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,180
that decides what the printer is going

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,980
to bring for you that day you own the

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,470
device but you are not in control of

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,850
what the device does and the the big

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,740
quote for me is that if you don't

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:42,160
control your life you are miserable and

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:45,010
this notion of essentially oppression is

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,580
what has been motivating me for all

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,620
these years

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,990
so the fact that if you are not in

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,570
control of your own computation then

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,520
someone is oppressing you someone

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,230
usually is the person or the company or

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,030
whatever that is created that software

00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,950
that's the power to change that software

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,070
instead of you and this is something

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:05,350
that really sank in me and what was I

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,990
doing at the time with my computer what

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,060
I was doing some pretty standard stuff I

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,550
was using some the adware that we added

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,590
a time which was mostly desktops and

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,210
local network servers I didn't have a

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,860
laptop because was really expensive for

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,110
students so I did get a lot of much

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,060
later and I was doing some content

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,740
reduction some content consumption the

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,310
kind of content I did produce at the

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:29,290
time was mostly office suites desktop

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,820
publishing and this kind of stuffs I was

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,890
doing some communication some emails

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,080
americium news group which was very cool

00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,400
at a time for geek communities and I was

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,080
doing some software development as a

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,509
newbie but that was what I was doing

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,999
that

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:43,189
I also did some content consumption so

00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,449
some gaming which arguably is content

00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:46,520
that someone else is producing for you

00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,990
to concern to consume I was doing some

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,849
web browsing the internet was not as

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,139
popularity today but there was some

00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:56,509
website you could find it interesting so

00:06:53,139 --> 00:07:00,379
in that situation with that kind of

00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:02,449
computing the actual path to software

00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:04,999
freedom and to control was fairly clear

00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,460
it was difficult but it was very clear

00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:09,499
to me as a new activist in free software

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,300
what I should have done what we all

00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:12,889
should have done to actually liberate

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,259
people from the oppression of people

00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,939
controlling our own computation so the

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,669
idea is that well you have a lot of

00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:22,009
pieces of a very software which you do

00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:24,229
not control and what you need to do is

00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,060
to replace every such a place there was

00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,529
such a component of the very software

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,779
with a free software equalizer

00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:32,029
equivalent so we were using some local

00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:33,770
application some game and we needed to

00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:36,139
replace it with an equivalent free game

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,330
we were using some client server

00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,969
software some male source and late

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:43,249
clients a mail server some IRC client

00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:45,110
some IRC server and what we needed to do

00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:48,319
to actually empower people and liberate

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,509
people was to rewrite those pieces of

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,580
software with free software equivalents

00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,529
so it was difficult because it was a lot

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,229
of stuff to be rewritten but it was

00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:59,990
fairly clear the plan was clear and also

00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:01,419
luckily we also had at the time all the

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,289
even lifting was already in place

00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:05,360
technological assistance is quite so

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:07,189
since quite a while the Linux kernel is

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,860
this existed already and he was working

00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:12,499
so someone else will shoulder larger

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,120
than the decoder I had at the time had

00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:16,189
already done a lot of work from me and

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,649
me and together with other free software

00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:21,229
activists what I had to focus on was to

00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:23,180
rewrite provider application into

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:25,550
equivalent free software application

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:29,539
possibly better so it was clear was a

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,449
hard but it was fairly clear and that's

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:35,659
where I think the notion of a free

00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:37,760
software project comes from so we we use

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,889
we use very often this term off of our

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,019
software project and I never ended up

00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:44,240
really thinking about that before a few

00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:45,920
years ago and I think the reason why we

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,390
call it free software project is that

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,939
there is an objective so there is a

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,410
mission ideally a time-limited one and

00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:53,510
that mission

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,970
writing a replacement for a Beretta

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:58,010
application using free software which is

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,740
as good possibly better than the

00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,840
original and having a lot of risk of the

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,330
project around give rise to a lot of

00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,400
releases so what we were doing a lot at

00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,350
the time in the 90s was to actually

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,860
manually install software on our own

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,810
machines to be fair we also add our lab

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,670
was running some radar machines at the

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,340
time there weren't that many packages

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,320
available and we had to fairly often

00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,600
install stuff by hand on the lab

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,610
machines in our own directories and also

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,740
on our computers at all and this is the

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,750
procedure you all know very well so you

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,700
download a power ball you run configure

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,560
your on make your on making stall the

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,870
first time I saw that was kind of a

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,370
magic magical recipe for me just follow

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,470
these steps and you will get some

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,540
software to play with well except that

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,810
every single step could fail of course

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,190
well let's let's keep aside for the

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,470
moment the fact that the website might

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,090
be down but your unconsidered you miss

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,010
some software you need to fetch it from

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,600
somewhere else you won't make you

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,460
encounter some compilation difficult

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,650
elation problem you are making stall

00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,470
maybe the path will clash and so on and

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,120
so forth so the problem with this

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,730
procedure for installing software were

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,220
using my hand is that you're essentially

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,610
conflicting rows you're mixing together

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,130
there all of software user the role of

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,860
system administrator and all of software

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,440
developers you need to have a little bit

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,140
of all those skills together to be able

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,940
to enjoy software so in a sense a free

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,310
software which works like this is

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,320
essentially a very elitist thing it's

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,170
only an elite which have all the needed

00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,180
skills was able to enjoy the benefits of

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,460
free software and is able to be in

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,370
control of their own computation and

00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,780
this is essentially the reason why

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,390
distributions much earlier had been

00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,730
invented okay so we all know very well

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,310
here what distribution do they sit in

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,620
between software developers and software

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,610
users and make it easy for you to

00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:54,470
actually use that software we do

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,300
installer work we create installers we

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,400
create package managers we do all the

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,050
integration work that make different

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,190
pieces of software work well together

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,850
and we actually make life easy for final

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,949
users

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,829
so for me something that I started

00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:12,049
believing is that the if the ultimate

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:14,839
mission of free software distributions

00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:17,329
is to actually democratize free software

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,489
to enable users which do not have

00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:22,069
software development skills or do not

00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:23,929
have system administration skills enable

00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:26,660
them to enjoy the benefit of free

00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:28,789
software so we offer very simple

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,009
interface we offer the equivalent of

00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,259
what these days are called app stores in

00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:35,299
which with one click you can just

00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,189
install some software and enjoy the

00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:40,939
benefit of that software in particular a

00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:44,019
free soft so this is for me the

00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:48,679
historical mission of distributions so

00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:50,329
later on in 1998 our lab decides to

00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,749
switch Debian and I was really happy

00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,179
about that

00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:54,889
we switched from rather to Debian and I

00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,089
look up about this project I started

00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:58,939
learning about what this project does

00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:01,429
and I find out that not only this

00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:03,589
project Debian was actually up to the

00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,959
mission of empowering the user by making

00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:08,869
it easy for users to use free software

00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:12,289
if you were the original announcement of

00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:13,909
Ian Murdock announcing the the Debian

00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:15,589
project we found this notion of being

00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:16,819
competitive with proprietor operating

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:21,350
system and it's really clear that the

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:23,029
point is empowering users and I end up

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,949
reading about this project and not only

00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:26,539
I found out that the mission they're up

00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:28,549
to is the mission I believe in but I

00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:30,049
found out that the key intuition there

00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:32,209
is to make the project a community

00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:34,609
project so not only the target are the

00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,229
users and empowering them but also the

00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:38,269
way to reaching that objective is

00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:40,579
creating fostering a community that will

00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,470
work together to that goal so I got

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:44,569
immediately hooked I vividly remember

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,579
the moment a colleague of mine a student

00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:48,109
explained to me D and not to me of a

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:49,999
Debian sauce package the fact that it

00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:51,229
was a dot or acknowledges that the fact

00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:52,759
there was a diff decide with the

00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,409
difference with respect to extreme and

00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,089
all those metal atom that was really

00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:58,309
thrilling from here from a technical

00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:01,339
point of view so a few years later I

00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:03,579
ended up joining the nm process I was

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,929
doing some Camel development at the time

00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:07,729
there were some libraries or cama

00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:09,949
libraries and others are missing and

00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:12,409
decided okay so maybe I should help and

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:16,629
create some libraries for for the

00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:16,629
project as well I went through an M and

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,370
there are a few things I've learned

00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,300
during an M and also in the subsequent

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,740
10 years or 15 years or so so one thing

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,110
I've learned in all these years in

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,300
Debian is the importance of being

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,660
principled so dannion is a project that

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,880
did not start from only technical means

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,200
but also decided at some point that he

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,090
needed some guidance some clear guidance

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,080
on what should do technically what issue

00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:45,940
that and an important documents where we

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,660
have distilled this notion are the DFS G

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,040
okay

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,780
the graphic software guidelines which

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,370
have been very influential on the free

00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,870
software movement as a whole they've

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,870
been used as a basis for the open source

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,550
definition as you know and what was very

00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,350
thrilling for me is that commitment that

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,080
we had in Debian in keeping the main

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,610
archive completely the FSG free keeping

00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,850
a completely free software this

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:10,000
commitment is depicted here by those

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:12,670
fearsome character and his owner on a

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,130
couch and it's mediating and triggering

00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,750
the new cue and supposedly and the new

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,240
cue is not necessarily the best way we

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,680
could implement a system which three age

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,450
of the stalker and archive not sure it

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,300
is the FSG free but it shows our

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,470
commitment to actually only follow the

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,110
guidelines that we have set for

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,820
ourselves it was really motivating for

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,130
me and the second thing I've learned

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,230
which will come handy in a bit is the

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,020
importance of the legal knowledge and

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,150
legal geeks in the face of the movement

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:44,290
like it or not free software as an idea

00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:46,000
is philosophical mainly but the its main

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,760
implementation is through the legal

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,460
system it's to copyright licenses so -

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,110
really - really grok what's happening in

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,160
free software in general to understand

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,620
what's where the free software movement

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,880
is going figuring out and really

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,370
understanding what's going on in the

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,350
legal system is very important and in

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,540
Debian we know that pretty well that's a

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,070
stumbling block for many people when

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,080
joining the Debian project it's

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,060
something we insist people are at least

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,330
basically familiar with and that's

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:16,600
pretty a pretty characteristic of the

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:19,300
Debian project so in the end what I've

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,490
learned is that in this quest that I

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,260
feel very much myself against the

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,660
oppression of someone else controlling

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:29,580
your own computation low if you act

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:33,260
around it smartly can be a very useful

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,820
a very useful device to liberate users

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,220
time passes that was supposed to be an

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,630
image here which for some reason

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:44,670
disappeared and we might argue that

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,650
these days we have achieved a lot since

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,560
that moment if I look around the

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,690
industry or in general if I look down

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,030
computing as people are doing that well

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,550
free software is a little bit everywhere

00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,500
in the industry it is there are some

00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,880
stats that claims that essentially every

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,400
single software product you find on the

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,740
market has a little inside of it at

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,680
least a little bit of software code and

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,910
if you look at all the different

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,650
application stacks we have from web

00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,960
servers to education to clients to

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:15,060
smartphone you find a lot of free

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,920
software free software infrastructure

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,110
that are everywhere ok so these are just

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,420
some stats I figure out in the in recent

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,790
years and for instance if we look at the

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,920
one of the key target market for Debian

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,770
that of servers will find now that one

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,110
website over 10 on the Internet in

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,610
general it's running Debian if you

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,380
include also some of our most popular

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,480
derivatives such a bundle will find that

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,400
more than 20% of the website are running

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,120
something which comes from our own work

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:44,160
and some of the recent hype on free

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,200
software is coming from has been coming

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,730
from the Snowden revelations and most

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,710
people are starting to be concerned

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,450
about what the software they're using is

00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,860
doing and it's turning to see free

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,800
software and is turning to stuff like

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,740
tales which is heavily Debian based to

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,290
actually see in which way we can help

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,940
them foster their own security ok

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,270
so in some sense we have achieved a lot

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,650
in a very in a in everything we do in

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,300
computing there is a little bit of what

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,230
we have done in free software and also a

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,780
little bit of what you have done in

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,180
Debian and this is pretty impressive he

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,670
said we are in a place where I wouldn't

00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:21,330
have dreamed being when I started in

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:24,209
1997 that's very impressive on the other

00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:27,240
hand there are some reasons of concerns

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:30,630
and this is the main thought I wanted to

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,940
share with you and there are some

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,160
technical reasons which we discuss often

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,560
in face of those circles like the fact

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,410
that ok but most of these platforms are

00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,880
not are not 100% free software if you

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,840
look at Martin's from smartphones

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,270
friends and you will find

00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,360
a lot of non freak out every here and

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:51,059
there and the point can be made that

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,830
either you have full control over your

00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:55,080
own computation or you're not in control

00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,610
at all because if your software stack is

00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,950
a single layer which is controlled by

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,080
someone else and is mediating all your

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,390
communication well maybe you are not so

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,799
sure that you're the real owner and the

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,559
real control of your own device and

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,419
that's absolutely a fair point we can be

00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,580
made some more technical points about

00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,289
for instance non free JavaScript more

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,299
and more of our computations are

00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:17,130
happening in our browsers and they're

00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:19,980
opening a new code which is delivered to

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,649
our browser by remote servers and those

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,690
code is not free at all and I absolutely

00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:27,990
agree with that but the point I want to

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:31,470
focus on for today is actually what we

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,270
call the cloud okay so having all my

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,250
images are gone

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:43,140
now I had a very nice you mention there

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:44,460
sorry so the remaining point and this my

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,559
main reason we are concerned is what

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,779
it's being called a cloud let allow me

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,520
to be a bit generic here for a moment I

00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,809
know there are very different parts in

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,510
what we call the cloud and will be

00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:56,039
specific in all of them in a bit but for

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,049
now I want to focus on the common trend

00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,840
that the cloud is bringing to computing

00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:03,270
these days so computing today for most

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,520
people is not much different from the

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,250
kind of computing I was doing 15 years

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,289
ago okay that's the kind of computing

00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,090
that we do on very different hardware so

00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,200
we have way more smartphone way more

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,240
tablets than in the past

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,370
and that's true that the kind of

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,010
activities we do producing content

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,840
consuming content is very similar the

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,850
big difference is the kind of

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,220
technological stack we are using and

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:29,039
where the computation of happening so

00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,020
for most people today our kind of office

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,789
suite we use is no longer a software

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,919
which is installing your machine but it

00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:38,039
is Google Docs I'm an academic myself

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,110
I'm very often forced to use some Google

00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:42,090
Docs application to work with others

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,799
otherwise I'm free not to work with them

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,570
okay because certain technological

00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:48,240
choice which would be made by someone

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:51,270
else for many people email as you know

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,950
just main Gmail and all the all our

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,510
emails even if you are not using Gmail

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,980
are ourselves are passing through some

00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,900
Gmail servers

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,540
synchronous communication still exists

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,340
but it's very often mediated to software

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,169
like Skype EOG tall and so on and so

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,830
forth we have seen this list very often

00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,990
okay

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,940
consuming content there as well we're

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,100
still doing gaming we're still doing

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,900
browsing but it's often mediated by

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,600
platform which are far away from us and

00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,640
just stream content to us or in the

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,830
specific case of web browsing there are

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,840
more and more often offset by a very few

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,090
authors in the world which we often

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,250
refers to a wallet garden that can do

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:30,000
whatever they want with our content okay

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,910
so the point here is not demonizing

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,190
those services people are using those

00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,410
services because they are convenient and

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,780
there is a lot of network effect going

00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,220
on that makes it easy for other people

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,140
to just start using those services so

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,960
it's really not the point of demonizing

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,360
those services the point here is

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,270
observing that interesting computations

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,059
that we are doing as a final as our as

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:56,250
our job as ro as our life are no longer

00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:58,110
happening on our machines but are

00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,510
happening another machines which are far

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:05,280
away from us and which are not under our

00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:08,669
direct control in this context for me I

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,290
confess what actually is the road to

00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:11,520
software freedom and doun control to

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,620
enable people to control their own

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,320
competition is no longer clear it's no

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,140
longer enough to say well we just need

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,120
to rewrite Google or Facebook or Twitter

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,640
in free software that's not enough

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,770
because even if you do that you have the

00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,299
problem that when you are using a server

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,880
you don't know if the code it is running

00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:31,320
is the one they claim if it's running so

00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,140
that's a very difficult problem to solve

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,360
and even if it were the case well where

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,040
do you deploy yourself a Google like

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,410
architecture or Facebook like

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,660
architecture you simply can't okay so

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,340
it's no longer enough to just say we

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,049
just need to do some software

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,179
development and we just need to make it

00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:50,790
better than the alternative there is a

00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,440
real tricky combination between software

00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:56,070
development and software deployment

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,620
which is not easy to see how to fix it

00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,049
at least for me it's it's you're very in

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,929
a very muddy water so what about distros

00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:06,120
so we are these two people doing one of

00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:08,520
the most popular districts in existence

00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,700
so are we winning or are we losing in

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,040
the

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,660
situation how are we doing in terms of

00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:18,990
our efforts so in a sense we are very

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,000
much winning a lot of our work is being

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,560
used to deploy those infrastructures a

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,120
lot of the infrastructure of the big

00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,190
companies are deploying on top of free

00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,660
software if not direct on top of our

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,030
very own systems

00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,310
maybe modified here and there where they

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,140
need to to make things better as it is

00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,420
their own right given its all free

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,220
software okay so in that sense we're

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,050
winning increasing market share we're

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,300
using that we're being used a lot to

00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,940
make infrastructure but we're also

00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,220
losing in the sense that we are really

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,010
not empowering user to be in control of

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,530
their own computations okay if our final

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,600
users are the sysadmin that are running

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,150
the infrastructure for them we are doing

00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,080
great we are making them be sure that

00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,510
they are in control of their own

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,610
infrastructure but from the final users

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,190
of those services we are really not

00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,560
empowering them at the moment so what I

00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,970
call the free software Dark Ages which

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,700
is an expression which actually borrowed

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:14,570
from from bad laocoön and defined I find

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,210
quite inspiring is a situation in which

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:20,370
we win on the end-user market so every

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,280
single device out there in the end of

00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:25,470
people desktop laptop even smartphones

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,870
we're all right now we are not doing

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,610
very well all of this is running free

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,250
software all of that is running Debian

00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:34,890
okay so total world domination as we

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:38,010
were talking about a long time ago but

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,960
all interesting computations all the

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,810
final user application which has been

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,780
used to going on with your digital life

00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,880
are no longer happening on your devices

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,950
happening far away from you on computer

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,240
you do not control some time with free

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,310
software some time with non free

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,100
software but in any case outside your

00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,240
control so in a sense this is very worse

00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,070
than for me because we have this

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,030
euphoria of saying we are really popular

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,830
okay

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:04,500
we are winning the word the world we

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:07,290
were using a lot of this warlike

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,010
terminology when I started but the word

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:12,450
that we are winning it seems to becoming

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,610
increasingly pointless because it's not

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,420
being useful to actually empower user to

00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:20,940
be in control of their own computation

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,530
to make things worse there seems to be

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,049
time some control

00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,789
that might be just you know a perception

00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:29,669
of mine maybe I'm being too pessimistic

00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:31,830
but it seems to me that as developer

00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:33,870
communities as other communities we are

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,630
becoming way more lenient we more

00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,730
relaxed about the lack of control on the

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,130
tools and the infrastructure we use to

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,360
make free software more and more often

00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,659
we see if yourself too developed on

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,710
known for infrastructure meaning

00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:48,179
infrastructure which are built using non

00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,429
free software and which are anyhow

00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:54,480
centralized in the end of a few holsters

00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:55,919
okay and with the new generation

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,539
developer which is coming up seems to be

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,919
totally fine with that so I'm not going

00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,960
to hurt you this point in much detail

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,940
there is a great essay by macro that I

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,530
encourage all of you to read free

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,200
software needs free tools which actually

00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,909
make a couple of points one is that by

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,320
using non free software to make free

00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:12,059
software you're sending out a very bad

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,070
message we are telling to the world that

00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,570
free software is good for you that's why

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,580
we are developing it but it's not good

00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:19,230
for us because we are using non free

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,320
tool to make it so that's a kind of

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,700
catch-22 in our advertising message but

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,880
it's also making the software we are

00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,190
creating indirectly less free because if

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,780
the favorite way to contribute to that

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,700
free software is using some non frame

00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,710
for structure some non free tools where

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,049
indirectly we're making people that only

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,000
want to use free software less apt to

00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:41,970
contribute to that software so really

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,830
recommended reading that s but also

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,960
technically we are going back to a sort

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,940
of a cage problem which is also problem

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,460
which has been called the problem of the

00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,799
bug that no one can fix by the FSF I

00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,080
think and essentially we're creating

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,940
software stacks in which some part of it

00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,760
is entirely free software that we can

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,980
debug and some other parts are non free

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,929
software or how software run by someone

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,289
else so we have lost the ability to

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:10,020
debug the full stack when I was starting

00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:12,059
to learning programming this idea that I

00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,340
could debug everything from the end user

00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:16,650
I was writing myself for an assignment

00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,990
down to the kernel level was just

00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:22,140
exciting for me and we seem to be losing

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:24,270
sight of this a little bit as a second

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:28,230
cultural problem we seem to be losing

00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:30,330
sight of how much help we could get from

00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,250
the legal system and from new legal

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,620
solution that we might be in need of

00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:38,200
finding an example of that is the

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,480
post open source software post-debate

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,280
which some of you might have run into

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,890
and that's the debate which actually

00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,140
observed that the new generation of free

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:49,360
software developers actually don't care

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,030
about licenses they just want to kick

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,010
out their code just put it on github not

00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:56,530
declaring a license at all and they're

00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:59,440
just fine with that okay so they want to

00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,940
be have to do web the hassle of deciding

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,520
first of all a license

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,020
second of all also some governance model

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,210
for their projects they just want to be

00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:11,380
hacking and doing and not caring about

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:13,900
those annoying details this could be

00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:18,550
interpersonally interpreted in positive

00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:20,590
ways like says that we want the the

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,630
right to work on the code and to do

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,400
whatever we want with that by default we

00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,750
do not want to be explicit in which kind

00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,950
of rights we give you and that's a very

00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,830
positive interpretation of this

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:32,230
phenomenon but in the end for now it is

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:35,290
creating a huge bunch of code that we

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,460
could not use as free software yet for

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,170
instance we cannot include in Babel

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,660
something that does not have a license

00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:43,120
at all okay a second example is the

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:46,900
debate about the non freeness of a GPL

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,670
if you look up the history of free

00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,590
software there's argument that the GPL

00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,140
itself is not free it's an argument that

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,670
was being used 20 years ago when the

00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,590
battle between copy life and

00:27:54,670 --> 00:28:00,190
liberalizing was very high was very

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:02,110
harsh and it's just recurring again so

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,300
maybe for some sign tactical

00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:06,160
interpretation of our own guidelines we

00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:09,160
could make the point that something like

00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,990
the GPL is non-free maybe but the point

00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,630
is that the way we distribute software

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:15,790
to find a user is really changing 20

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:18,610
years ago or 15 years ago the main way

00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,679
to enable some user to use a piece of

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,270
software was actually to make a copy of

00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:25,179
that software and give it to him or to

00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:27,280
her via the network or some media and

00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:28,450
that was conveying that kind of

00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,760
conveying software is clearly

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,730
distribution and that kind of activity

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,040
used to trigger some sort of license

00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:38,020
clauses these days the software is no

00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,480
longer be distributed that way in large

00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,820
parts is being used over the net and

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,550
something like the LGPL is the

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,560
equivalent of triggering some licensing

00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,240
condition we are the main wayne or

00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,870
distributing of giving access to

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,940
software so I want to enter in videos of

00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,530
this debate those are just example from

00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,830
either example of the fact that we are

00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,000
kind of losing faith in how much the

00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,900
legal system and free software

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,210
intertwine and this actually mix is very

00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,370
badly with the situation in which users

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,620
are losing control because computations

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,630
are moving away from that I think this

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,820
situation in general is not going to fix

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:20,230
themselves and we as distribution people

00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:23,040
have all to play in fixing it so what

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,440
could be a role for Debian in all this

00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,440
computing situation we have these days

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,960
so the common trend in the so-called

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,660
cloud seems to be that computations are

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,730
moving away from user devices and we

00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,680
cannot just say well just don't use

00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,300
anything cloudy because it is convenient

00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,190
people will want to use that we need to

00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,520
do something different so distribution

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,020
people we could do a lot I think and I

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,580
have a couple of thoughts to share with

00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:53,170
you that are different depending on the

00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,910
on the service model so-called service

00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,260
model of the cloud so one of the first

00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,940
service model of the cloud you might

00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,680
have heard about is the infrastructure

00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,530
as a service where essentially you have

00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,600
servers that give virtual machines to

00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,790
people and essentially you can you get

00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,500
to administer your own machine which is

00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,780
a virtual machine on a virtual machine

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,070
servers controlled by someone else this

00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,470
is potentially very good for people

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,690
because it is lowering the barrier you

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,490
need to have your own server when I

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:22,000
first set up my own server with friends

00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:23,980
in at the end of the 90s while we had to

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,020
buy some machine to find someone kind

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,790
enough to host it paying the hosting

00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,550
fees and so on and so forth and was

00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:33,010
something that was by far not at all

00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:35,470
accessible to the random user these days

00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,050
a lot of people can simply go to some

00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:40,120
vital Machine provider rent a virtual

00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,920
machine with one-click button and they

00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,630
have their own machine to administer

00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,520
maybe they don't have the skill to

00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,160
administer administer it that's a

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,330
different problem what we're definitely

00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,550
lowering the barrier to access to have

00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:54,400
your own server and do your own remote

00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:56,470
computations so as debian we are doing

00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,420
pretty well in this area I think we are

00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,670
offering technologies like OpenStack and

00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,380
other competitors of OpenStack which are

00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,950
seems to be the market leader on that

00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,679
market

00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,750
entirely free software but I think we

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,480
should be investing more in offering a

00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,669
trivial deployment experience for Debian

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,220
users we should make trivial for people

00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:17,200
to have their own virtual machine

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,460
servers if there are not computer geeks

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,149
they should be able to flock together

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,649
friends which have software system and

00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,389
min special ability and have their own

00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:27,700
local

00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:30,250
IaaS and have their own virtual machine

00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,929
without having to rely on being austere

00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:34,120
provided offer virtual machines to

00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:36,970
everyone in the world this is would be a

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,440
great step toward autonomy so as Debian

00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,350
what is the best deployment experience

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,200
we can offer for people that want to set

00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,490
up their own virtual machine servers

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,230
then there is another service model

00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,539
which is called path platform

00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,070
as-a-service this is a kind of service

00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:54,039
model in which essentially you have

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:56,350
Auster's of application engines you

00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:59,950
develop location targeting specific

00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:01,389
application engine and sorry application

00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,429
servers so you target specific

00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:06,549
application service an example of this

00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:08,889
is a Google App Engine ok and I think in

00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:11,440
some sense this service model of the

00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:12,909
cloud is mostly her toga now to what we

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,250
do with the distribution because either

00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:16,510
you're using a full-fledged distribution

00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,940
and you do your own system

00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,139
administration or you are developing an

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,299
application for a specific application

00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:24,820
server and you are relying on someone

00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:26,559
else to do that administration so yes I

00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,990
think that's most a lot to what we do

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,970
but might also be a symptom that there

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:33,340
is a reject from the application

00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:36,399
developer community I reject from the

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,440
way they can target distribution like

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,179
Debian so if it is very difficult with

00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,370
your own application running properly on

00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:44,889
Debian because we have all software

00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,809
because we change libraries because we

00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:48,580
do not accept multiple copies of the

00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:50,110
same libraries and so on and so forth if

00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,299
it is too difficult for application

00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:54,690
developers to target Debian they might

00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:57,460
be more and more tempted to target a

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:59,350
application service like paas

00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,350
so there might be something we could do

00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:04,659
this here like finding better synergies

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,720
between containerization technology we

00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:10,809
have some work being done in Debian and

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,309
the way you usually develop some we

00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:13,570
usually maintain a distribution there

00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:16,000
might be something we could do about

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:18,430
this here oh and I didn't mention this

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,650
but I have no hands no specific answer

00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,970
to give to you just a train of thoughts

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,240
they wanted to share with you and what

00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:27,340
we could do to endure the situation and

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,620
the final service model we have in the

00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,120
cloud which is I think worrisome from

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,120
the point of view of user of user

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,310
experience or control is SaaS software

00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,350
as a service they're essentially use

00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:41,050
your own device your own computer only

00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,910
as a thin client and they lie entirely

00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,770
on a remote server to do your own

00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:47,440
computation so we are back to the

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,930
mainframe thin client distinction of the

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,820
early days of computing and here there

00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:53,980
is a lot we could do I think but also a

00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,710
lot we could not do here most of the

00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:59,080
work should come from up streams we need

00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,600
better free software and federated

00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,120
replacement for popular centralized and

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,010
preparator applications in which users

00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,280
can participate in some kind of network

00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,870
by using their own node ok and this is

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,340
work that should not come from

00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,080
distribution itself it should really

00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,270
come from application developers

00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,879
upstream but still there are stuff they

00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:21,490
are useful things we could do here so we

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,399
already have a lot of building blocks we

00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:27,129
have stuff like on cloud get an x media

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:29,290
gobbling part no taiyou web yeah see we

00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,950
have a lot of good building blocks most

00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:34,330
of them are not yet up to par with the

00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:37,210
centralized proprietor equivalent but

00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:40,330
I'm confident we could gather what we

00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,220
lack is the equivalent ease of

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:46,169
deployment of these services on user

00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:48,399
machines in some sense if we have

00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:50,770
democratized the installation of

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,030
software 20 years ago with distributions

00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:57,190
well these days to face the challenge of

00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,200
control over our own computation we need

00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,770
to make it as easy as using a package

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,530
manager to install your own nodes using

00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:08,650
those applications ideally everyone in

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:11,860
the world without nothing more than

00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:14,590
basic computing skills you computer user

00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,990
skill should be able to have its own

00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:19,360
machine at home doing some anonymous

00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:21,880
browsing doing some mail handling doing

00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,680
web hosting doing storage Calendar doing

00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,720
encrypted PT peer-to-peer backup and so

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,150
on and so forth I'm maintaining my own

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,920
mail server and it is a user of work I

00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,800
struggle myself to keep

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,850
with the need of knowledge and of

00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,550
surveillance that I need to make my own

00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:39,580
mail server to be able to turn it

00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:41,320
properly and I get blacklisted from time

00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,570
to time from the providers and it's a

00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,480
pain it's something that no one without

00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:48,880
having at least some basic system and a

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,800
certain ability could do properly this

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,360
is the thing we need the the not winning

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,880
the not we need to track we need to

00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,400
empower everyone out there to have its

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,050
own computer with its own node of those

00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,960
services and of course you are all

00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:03,280
thinking at the freedombox now and

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,980
that's a great example of a project who

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,900
wants to take off precisely that problem

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,000
if it's a broad project that's been

00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,710
announced by urban mobile in a few years

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,530
ago at the depth curve if my memory

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:18,220
serves me well it's heavily based on on

00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:20,530
Debian and it's doing exactly that but

00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:23,080
my question from the Debian point of

00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:25,480
view is maybe this project should not

00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,510
only be a spin-off of data should not

00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,580
only be there derive this derivative

00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,320
distribution of data maybe we should

00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:34,750
think in making something like this as

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,700
first-class citizen in Debian I don't

00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,770
know exactly what that means yet it's

00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,600
something we could think about having

00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,950
the main administration interface for

00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,230
Debian something that target these

00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,730
specific scenarios we could generalize

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,730
that we do not need to target only

00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,450
specific plug devices because people at

00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,490
home myself

00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,990
that superb Utah's matter Media Center

00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:56,350
they might want to have something like

00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:58,750
the freedom box at home and collaborate

00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:02,110
with other immediately my point here is

00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:04,960
that if our mission back in the days was

00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,460
to democratize free software by making

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,770
it easier to install software on your

00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,660
machine well today our mission is

00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,730
democratized free software by making it

00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:15,340
trivial to install some node of some

00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:19,000
Federation of three services on your

00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:21,550
machine and another thing we could do

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,640
and is the last one for me today is to

00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:26,140
SAP step in the free service debate when

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,390
I started looking up these arguments a

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:31,360
few years back I was surprised by the

00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:34,810
fact and it's still not clear what does

00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,790
it mean to be a free service ok when I

00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:38,590
started working on free software 15

00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,810
years ago it was fairly clear what does

00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,820
free software mean sure there was some

00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,840
terminology debate between free software

00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,420
and open source which still

00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,220
today but the basic freedoms the basic

00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,650
right that you should have to call

00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,780
something free and opensource was fairly

00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:55,180
clear that kind of intellectual debate

00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,760
had already happened at the time today

00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:00,340
where the problem of computations moving

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,260
away from individual user is ranging

00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,870
there is no clear consensus on that

00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,070
matter there is some great work for

00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,890
instance there is the frankly Street

00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:10,750
statement on free network service I

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:14,200
think that's the full title they came

00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:16,860
back to 2000 2008 at 60 years ago in

00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,750
which you find a lot of very useful

00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,820
recommendation for users for software

00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,370
developers and for system administrators

00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,920
to make sure that you maximize your

00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:29,740
control over your own computation on the

00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,840
network but they take now issue notes

00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,420
stance on what does it mean to be a free

00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,370
service ok is it enough to have

00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,050
something which is free you do need

00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,580
moral in the specific license there are

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,650
strong icons some recommendation on that

00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:46,270
point but still there are no clear

00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:48,910
answer to this question sorry there is

00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:51,340
another work by your MS 2010 about

00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,430
software as a service or service as a

00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:56,170
software substitute as he calls it and

00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:58,690
here essentially what you have is a

00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,790
Mainer combination about don't you not

00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,770
using software's a service at all

00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:05,230
essentially there is a recommendation of

00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,570
doing your own computation on your own

00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,890
machines I think that might be

00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,080
well that's generally good

00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,910
recommendation but it's not gonna scale

00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,860
it's not going to be enough in my

00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,230
opinion to convince people not to use

00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:20,020
very convenient services think we need

00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,030
more gradual and blurry lines saying

00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,700
encouraging people to keep computation

00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:26,530
closer to them to rely on Federation of

00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,840
friends of people to do computation

00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,180
together and we as distribution people

00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:34,390
could make it easier for them to do so

00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:36,280
and then there is another work which is

00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:38,080
network services aren't free or non free

00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,060
which is a couple of years later stood

00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,380
by RMS which essentially tried to walk

00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,570
the fine line between what's the

00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,220
difference between a pure service so

00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:47,380
service the just for instance convey

00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,510
messages as opposed to a service which

00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,940
does computation that could have been

00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,890
done instead on your machine and that's

00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,990
a very fine like to work it's very

00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,670
difficult to stay there and what we

00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:00,640
might need there

00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,410
is a stronger position actually in which

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,600
you try to replace everything which is

00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,370
centralized with federated equivalent

00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,140
and say that we as free software people

00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,870
distribution people should work in that

00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:12,910
direction so what we could do in that

00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:15,700
men well I think we should try to step

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:18,160
in this debate surprisingly for me we

00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:21,030
still have no clear answer to what does

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,890
it mean to be a free service today and

00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:25,900
we have quite a bit of experience in

00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:28,210
Debian in leading debates in the era of

00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,280
free software we've created the DFS G

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,080
which has been use example for many

00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,240
other communities we participated in the

00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,760
gplv3 discussion for instance our

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,590
decision in terms of free license or

00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,380
looked upon and look up by other

00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:42,610
projects so we might have the authority

00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,160
and the reputation to step in these

00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:48,100
debates and we also have a lot of

00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,960
technical knowledge in the area so being

00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,520
a free saw acordes tribution committed

00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,610
to free software we know a thing or two

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,880
not only about software freedom but also

00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,350
about how you deploy software ok how

00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,940
difficult it is and how difficult it

00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,520
should be for people to deploy free

00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:06,100
software so I think we are in a just the

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,590
sweet spot to actually enter this debate

00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,480
with the needed authority and make a

00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:12,850
contribution to actually help people

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,520
realize what does it mean today to use a

00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:18,250
free service so the concluding question

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:22,200
I have for you it's so what's they can

00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:25,210
take today only berating users would be

00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,980
would we be happy enough to have Debian

00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,440
on every machine in the world if people

00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:32,080
are using completely remote services and

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,390
if we were not well what should we do

00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:37,210
what should be working on to change that

00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:41,290
future which seems very much the future

00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:43,690
that we have at hand so yeah pictures

00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:46,600
are gone so there was a cloudy network

00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:49,480
cloudy a cloud there are any cloud on

00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:53,080
the last there was Debian here and Sun

00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,850
here so late beam arrow ticks or

00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,680
something is playing tricks on me so

00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,660
that's all I have for you I hope you

00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,690
have given you some food for thought for

00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,790
this week and if you have any question

00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:05,470
or comments or in these topics I'm very

00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,990
much happy to hear about that thanks a

00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:18,440
lot

00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:18,440
[Applause]

00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:27,400
this seems to be a mic which is floating

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,400
around down there

00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:49,080
he's not quite a lot and quite

00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:52,480
brilliantly about what cloud computing

00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,340
buzzwords mean for free software but I

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,340
think one important battles that we're

00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:00,790
actually losing is for hearts and minds

00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:02,860
of people why is it young developers or

00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:06,760
newcomers to free software don't care

00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:09,160
about software being free

00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,270
why don't they care about non free using

00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,300
non free tools

00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:15,190
why don't they care about which licenses

00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,340
a declare for the software if any

00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:21,520
licenses at all and so on you mentioned

00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:25,930
that problem but what do we do about it

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,490
do you have any ideas well a friend of

00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,980
mine when asking a similar question I

00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:32,800
think one sans word well what could they

00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,540
say more than all of those young kids so

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,330
I don't know maybe it's our fault maybe

00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,400
we have failed as as a generation to

00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:41,110
convey the importance that being in

00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,080
control of our own conversation at or

00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:46,810
maybe it's just that the public that is

00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,400
open to coding and hacking is much

00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:50,140
larger than in the past so we are

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,760
reaching out to other communities and

00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,890
it's very good for them to be coding

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,720
because I think every citizen in the

00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:57,610
world need to have some basic knowledge

00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,100
of coding to understand what's happening

00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:02,080
in the world but maybe they just have

00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:06,340
different mission than we had in the

00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:10,390
past so your very good question I didn't

00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:18,040
have a very good answer sorry all right

00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:19,990
hello sorry is this it's good okay so I

00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,520
thank you so much for the wonderful talk

00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,190
and I think it's great to talk about

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,310
these political issues and I see there's

00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:30,400
a a challenge between the sort of very

00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:32,440
individual focus of each person being

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,050
able to use their own computer as they

00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,820
wish which has its own values but

00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:39,490
there's a different sort of value that

00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:43,630
relates to power structures in general

00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:46,750
so we're talking about not just how free

00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:48,670
is each individual person but whether an

00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,110
entity like Twitter or Google or

00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:53,290
Facebook or some of these other services

00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:56,160
is a very powerful entity that has power

00:44:53,290 --> 00:45:00,210
over the majority of us who

00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,730
use their services and so I wonder if I

00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:06,240
led likely thoughts on on thinking about

00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:09,420
it less as a is this software free but

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,640
about who is in power in the community

00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:15,810
and so in a democratic sense you could

00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:19,020
have the community that builds the tools

00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:21,980
together has governance structures or

00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:24,660
has mechanisms for handling power that

00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:27,720
make the power more bottom-up and more

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:30,300
democratic and maybe that's as are more

00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:33,150
important than the technical status of

00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:35,340
each individual user yeah so as a

00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:37,920
concerned citizen and also as a

00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:42,090
political activist I very much share

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:45,270
your concern I think we need to focus on

00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:47,520
what it's at hand reach for us as geeks

00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:49,920
in this circle and have this kind of

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,710
discussion in different circles so as

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,690
someone with active in politics I very

00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,300
much try and as a geek I very much try

00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:59,820
to actually explain to politician and to

00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,220
activist there all of what we are doing

00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,810
here in very technical ways and the

00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,940
impact that it has on politics in

00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:07,500
general and I think be a lie in the talk

00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,850
later on this evening might have a thing

00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,370
or two about to say about that as well

00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:14,010
so from our part

00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:16,830
I need we need to understand it in some

00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:18,900
sense even if we advanced a lot the

00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:21,120
status quo of user control of a

00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:23,610
technology that we had 50 years ago

00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,330
we're also started to lag behind in many

00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,680
other areas

00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:29,580
something that I wanted to mention

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,650
before but I fail to do so is that when

00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,540
we were doing my computing in the 90s a

00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:36,570
lot of computation were mediated by

00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:39,060
clearly defined protocols so we add RFS

00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:41,040
CFCs or equivalent document by other

00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,820
organization which were like clearly

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,810
market passed through how to collaborate

00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:48,240
technically on the internet and how to

00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:51,810
make software talk together in a sense

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,360
that culture of interoperability of

00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:56,520
protocols is actually like started

00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,130
lagging behind a lot with respect to

00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,640
popular technology so stuff like social

00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,130
networks

00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,570
most of them except the the good ones

00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,210
that free software guys are trying to

00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:08,190
build like BAM dot IO like the aspera

00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,690
well all the stuff does technology

00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:12,750
started up with

00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:14,819
any kind of interoperability in mind so

00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:17,400
technically I think we should we need to

00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:19,380
push against again on the direction of

00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,940
interoperability of protocols and that's

00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,950
the technical contribution that we could

00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,500
do that we live an impact you know code

00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:26,940
is law as Leslie was saying and that

00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,770
would have a technical impact on the

00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:33,539
power structure you mentioned that's

00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:37,440
that my thought on this matter so I have

00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:38,970
a answer opening hello yes I have an

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,880
answer all sort of an answer to the to

00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,980
the previous question so this is of

00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,400
course the heart of the difference

00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,420
between free software and open source

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,000
the difference between free software

00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:54,660
open source isn't nothing at all and

00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:00,329
it's not about licenses it's about goals

00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:03,210
and aims and over the past decades those

00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:06,690
you know many of us have chosen not to

00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:09,900
pick a fight with open source people

00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:13,049
just for an easy life and you know it's

00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:16,140
always easier to have somebody who might

00:48:13,049 --> 00:48:18,210
share some of your goals and and to be

00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:21,890
able to collaborate with them but less

00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:24,480
and less is it becoming the case that

00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:27,630
the goals of people who are doing

00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,720
open-source are the same as the goals of

00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:34,289
people doing free software you can see

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,089
that very clearly in the responses from

00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:40,819
people like Google to things like the a

00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:44,220
GPL and there are a lot of examples so

00:48:40,819 --> 00:48:45,630
one of the things that we can do to try

00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,660
and bring some of the new crop of

00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:52,260
developers along with us is to actually

00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:53,880
make a bit more of a fuss about you know

00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,829
let's not you know come over all

00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,839
Stallman about that storm install Sulman

00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:58,859
is is not the best PR guy but I think

00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,510
dead

00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:02,490
Debian can do a lot better than he can

00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:05,339
and we've probably got a lot more

00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:08,279
credibility and individually we have as

00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:14,099
well and what we need to do is we need

00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:18,839
to explain our vision to those new

00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:20,640
developers who mostly are just being you

00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:22,859
know that they see an open-source

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,010
marketing machine and wear something

00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,010
different

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,970
Thanks so does not need to be a question

00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:32,700
announcer so if you have comments feel

00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:34,260
free so I think we're running short of

00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:37,770
time and we need to go get more question

00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:40,140
so maybe one last or Stefano one last or

00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:43,380
we can okay well last question or

00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:45,690
comment just a quick comment if I may

00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,940
you talked about you know federated

00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:50,790
services and Facebook and Dropbox and

00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:53,430
that sort of thing sorry um I I think

00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:55,110
maybe the issue here is this perhaps

00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:58,220
less about federated services but it's

00:49:55,110 --> 00:50:00,750
about identity you know if I have my own

00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:03,510
Dropbox alike and you have your own

00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:05,130
Dropbox alike the problem is not

00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,300
necessarily the two couldn't talk to

00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,950
each other but we have no way of

00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:11,490
negotiation that sort of identity

00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:13,140
authentication access kind of problem

00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:14,820
and I think maybe part of the answer

00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,640
your question is can we come up with

00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:20,190
some way of allowing federated Identity

00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:24,300
Management for people in general rather

00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:26,760
than just us say so I think this is very

00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,310
much related to what i answering before

00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,720
to heroin in the sense yes we could we

00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:33,570
have shown in the past that we can come

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,000
up with very smart protocols that allow

00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:39,870
allow people to technically interoperate

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,710
over the net but we are we're coming too

00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,480
late for that

00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:44,880
so those big entities which now have the

00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,910
power to attract a lot of user to them

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,640
developed before those standard that we

00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:52,680
could have used to make smaller entities

00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,690
interoperate could have been put in

00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:57,000
place so yes I agree with you there is

00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:59,640
technical work to be done but in some

00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,590
sense where we are late in doing that

00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,050
work and the question now is not only

00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:05,850
how could we do the technical word that

00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:07,860
allows to have smaller entities that

00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:10,350
interoperate for authentication or for

00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:13,380
having everything else and also how do

00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:15,450
we migrate from the status quo to the

00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,070
ideal word that would be possible even

00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:20,370
though standard existed in the first

00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:22,080
place so in a sense we I think we're a

00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:24,390
bit late and now we have twice the work

00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,890
to be done before reaching the optimal

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:31,230
and more federated situation which I

00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:40,820
think would solve the problem so thanks

00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:40,820
