00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:11,550
the stock is about long-term support and

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:13,710
squeeze it brief I guess I will not

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,250
really introduce me I use Debian since

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:22,619
many years most I run stable all the

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:30,810
time how many of you use old stable at

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:36,630
the moment how many of you have used old

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:40,640
stable in the past everybody and who's

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,640
rusty running Lenny system somewhere

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:54,649
Ed's yes sir running it sart's anyone

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:06,470
how many of how many of you use squeeze

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,210
ATS everybody was using squeeze against

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:13,110
how many of you plan already planned to

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,400
use wheezy ATS because it's a nice idea

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,400
but currently it's just a plan

00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:31,640
how many of you have uploaded packages

00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:40,369
to squeeze LTS who is planning to upload

00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:44,420
packages so ATS means long-term support

00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:47,990
it extending the lifetime of squeeze two

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,780
by five by two years to five it's hosted

00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,520
on on the FTP archive like all the other

00:01:50,780 --> 00:02:00,619
suits and it's currently two

00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:02,630
architectures only I 386 and MV 64 using

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:06,520
ATS is pretty simple you just add this

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:10,610
to the sources list and be done

00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:17,209
so for supposed to May 2016

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:22,220
this should target new packages formally

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:23,700
it's organized by CC on or the paid part

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,830
of it

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,830
[Music]

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,720
keep both of them do we remove security

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,989
why do we still have security if we're

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:48,459
gonna have squeeze LTS by for historic

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:50,530
reasons it's you keep squeezing this in

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,300
the sources.list you keep the Security

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,010
Archive there but there will be no more

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,590
security archives there so you can also

00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:00,060
remove them I'm not sure whether there's

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,500
two pickups us in there or well and

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,940
maybe the question should be other

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,860
packages that are gonna go into the

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,140
security archive during this squeeze

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,170
cycle also going into the squeeze LTS

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:15,010
archive no there are no packages going

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:27,670
in security Amina and the ATS package to

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:32,890
stay in eight years creep frisian is the

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:36,299
company of Rafael had soaked yes this

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:39,730
this page explains ATS quite well on

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:52,590
this is it's also very suitable this

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:57,280
page to show to potential sponsors and

00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:02,829
the aim is to get 160 hours per month

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:06,609
funded so far there is funding for 36

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:14,260
hours I think this is what's on this web

00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:17,709
page there this bar is the aim and this

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:24,520
is updated manually because the idea is

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:28,120
to find far paid paid paid developers to

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:34,919
the security updates the microphone for

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,919
Connelly's method the microphone

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:45,750
just just I mean no I'm not saying that

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,880
for myself by far but I mean looking at

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,390
the hourly rates and that you're looking

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,550
to be able to hire people a well it

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,130
would be nice if you considered hiring

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:59,130
looking for people in countries less

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,630
less expensive than Europe I mean people

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,790
in my country would be happy to have

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,420
that day salary per day instead of per

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:10,800
hour I'm aware that we discussed this

00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:14,270
also on the on the list so far nobody SS

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:23,610
has replied to this request of the only

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:26,340
people the only people having applied

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,570
are actually from Europe nobody else has

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:32,850
applied so it's five people so far and

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:36,650
you could apply of course it maybe not

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,650
you because you have a job differently

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:47,430
technically we use one git repository at

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,410
Frisian which is mostly for the

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,669
bookkeeping stuff and for fine work

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,860
which looks for packages which ones us

00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:58,860
have indicated they need support for

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:03,660
that so that we prioritize work based on

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:06,000
that besides that we use the normal SVN

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,860
repository secure testing which is also

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,380
used by the security team and so we also

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:19,380
share the security tracker to find to

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:23,750
track CVEs and track which which is

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,750
Packers fix in which package inversion

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:32,550
the Debian security team is as a team

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:35,340
not participating in 80s though

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,010
individual members like Rafael Kaiser or

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,130
mod moon of are participating in 80

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,130
years

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,710
this uploads can be done by any DD and

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,150
besides that there are no restriction

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,580
there's no new queue there is no

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:58,360
proposed updates what gets uploaded goes

00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,550
directly to the archive and the only

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:05,590
thing than the announcement mayor has to

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:09,930
be sent manually besides that so we did

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,930
this to keep the barrier for entry low

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,780
there are some packages in squeeze which

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,820
are unsupported already this is the list

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,550
you get that when you install the Debian

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:30,550
security support package that's a space

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:32,530
missing which is currently available not

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,030
sure if they're available for movies

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:38,770
already because it's not in busy

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:45,190
definitely maybe it's only in 80s but

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:50,910
this is the list currently so most of

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:56,849
the packages are supported there's also

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:59,530
um show you a search interrupt again I

00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:02,080
see there one package that I am not

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,510
directly maintaining but I could

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,430
perfectly upload as I use it and they

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:09,910
keep it updated on my existence that's a

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:13,090
Drupal 6 is there a specific specific

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,880
reason why it's listed I have no idea

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,660
okay

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,330
therefore you need to talk to the

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:23,490
security - I don't know why - personal

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,490
support yes

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,990
but the security team doesn't support

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,790
the LTS so why would the security team

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:38,500
decide which things can't be supported

00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:41,740
an LTS good question I think this is for

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,780
historian I think it's historic for

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,640
historic reasons of course if Cunha

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,220
wants to decide to buy six air to

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,950
support Cooper six they can do that and

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:56,470
then probably that would be changed it's

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:58,870
not true any more than obviously there

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,140
have been things where the happen caters

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,440
where the security team has said we can

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,390
no longer support this in staple even

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,800
before the end of regular stable support

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:17,140
perhaps some of those who long for that

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:20,740
but there have been cases where security

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,170
support has been dropped even before the

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,650
end of regular support for stable

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:29,340
because it became impossible to back

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,340
port fixes

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:53,960
whether this list when when this list

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:56,140
was made basically updated I don't know

00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,140
actually

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,060
um this this as you as you see this

00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:09,050
packet has also really new it's only

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,640
available in Jesse answered so also this

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,260
idea are having having a package

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,540
installed which checks your system

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,980
whether there's unsupported software's

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:27,100
really new and not really fledged

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:33,800
outward at there are also some special

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:35,390
packages which are updated not by just

00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,190
applying patches but when you getting

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:43,970
new extreme versions PHP files and

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,920
Tomcat six are in this boat for for easy

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,120
it would also be Tomcat 7 we're just the

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,340
new absolute version was done ice fees

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,510
are the same in squeezes basically

00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,730
unsupportable unfixable there are if we

00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,830
want to support

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:05,060
iceweasel on squeezed stir then it would

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,590
be just a new upstream version when MPEG

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,660
would be in the same boat but it's

00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,650
dropped this from the security support

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,650
so that's not playing

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:26,910
so the ways to contribute us once is

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:28,800
becoming a sponsor and what you get for

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,850
is this that we prioritize the packages

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,730
being worked on

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,640
based on the wishes of the sponsors and

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:40,020
the amount they've money they give

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:45,510
that's on this page the sponsors are

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:53,010
listed who actually were contributing

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:57,330
now and there is more direct access to

00:11:53,010 --> 00:12:02,400
us which so far has not happened but ATS

00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:05,000
is only two months old or three and four

00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:18,080
the highest ones are in class we also

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:18,080
accept test cases that's your test case

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,690
we do who are normally on the open

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:37,480
mailing list on the debian list server

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:39,010
and we have an IRC channel as well other

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,460
ways to contributing is of course just

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:52,710
fixing your package or sending patches

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:52,710
reviewing them or testing packages and

00:12:52,950 --> 00:13:03,550
future plans of course VZ ITSs an option

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:07,750
and but I don't I'm not sure if this

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:10,360
squeeze ats is a good suit name maybe

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,580
change this again so on the other hand a

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:17,790
modern kind of changing suits name all

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,790
the time but I don't know

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,899
[Music]

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:30,200
would it be an option to reuse the

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,750
existing squeeze suit instead of having

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,670
everyone having an old stable addis for

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,720
other source drop other sources to make

00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:40,370
sure the key doesn't expire no that

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,130
basically take over from the from the

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,720
old stable by the LTS team instead of

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,000
doing a migration i mean for users that

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,690
don't care they would be automatically

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,840
migrated to LTS and if they do then fine

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:56,000
but i think the current process of

00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,040
having a new source at different

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,320
represent a different suit while the

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,730
other one is induce anymore anyway is a

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,980
little bulky for the users yes but that

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:12,290
way you would get ATS upgrades even if

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:14,780
you don't want them and I'm I put my

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,670
squeeze systems I run the copy off of

00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,450
squeeze IDs because I don't want all

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:22,310
updates because there is no restrictions

00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,950
on what gets into the archive so I look

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,380
manually at the packages so I wouldn't

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:31,220
be happy if some squeeze ATS would

00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:35,230
replace squeeze it's more work this way

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,230
yes you need to touch your system once

00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:49,980
that's the end of my talk already so

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,980
more questions

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,690
it's there Oh a work list of silver wish

00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:04,840
list of things that need doing for

00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:07,950
yourselves yes yes there is this fine

00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,950
work script

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:31,130
that you the Doozers network and the

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:43,850
secure testing repository also maybe not

00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:46,130
that slow life damage always brave the

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,730
security trekkers at the moment broken

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:52,790
in regards of LTS that it simply doesn't

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,720
know LTS I've got the fixed version on

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,030
my laptop

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,550
which is half working with a TS which I

00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,470
hope to finish this week was a toughie

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,290
here so that the security tracker will

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:06,620
support LTS completely and then it then

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:09,310
it's easy to see which packages like

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,310
which CV

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,960
while it's loading can we get back to

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,150
old stable versus LTS gonna give an

00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,400
example of why what do you want to not

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:31,339
pull an update from LTS on your old

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:34,550
stable system for example you are new

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:37,580
our high speeds aversion is it not

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:40,010
supported in not yes anyway while it is

00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:44,000
but are in new ice field I wouldn't mind

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:46,670
but whatever state that's the idea of

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,270
fixing php5 with a new upstream version

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:54,230
with the mineral versions of 5.3 I don't

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:56,930
know what this has behavioral changes

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,460
caused some bug fixes are intrusive so

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,580
maybe your code doesn't work with the

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:06,860
PHP version anymore that would be an

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:09,350
example so in other words LTS scope is

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:12,890
much wider than that of security depth

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:18,740
and or so it's not just why a longer in

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:24,640
time it's also wider in scope is that

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,640
really saying yeah thanks

00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:45,350
so given the scope distinction that if

00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:48,110
the LTS could include changes that are

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,330
larger in scale than security updates if

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,789
I am running let's say a couple of

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,340
servers that are running squeeze LTS

00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:57,799
what is the recommended workflow because

00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,710
usually at least my my experience with

00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,389
say other distributions with LTS is I

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,600
can run apt-get just upgrade or the

00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:08,509
equivalent and if anything on my system

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,950
breaks either there's a regression or

00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:11,809
there was literally no other way to

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,090
solve a security issue and I'm happier

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:15,529
for it to have the regression what

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,059
should I be doing should I be setting up

00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:19,460
my own apt archive like you do and

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:22,309
importing things as a user of the LTS

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,700
you should basically read what what's on

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:27,889
the screen when you're doing upgrade

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:31,789
sure is that that does the packages

00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:36,350
being upgraded and so far all upgrades

00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:40,940
have been good what happens if one is

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:45,470
not good well this is theoretically risk

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:48,499
I see because there is no management no

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:52,490
gatekeeping nothing but so far all

00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:55,490
uploads were good that's what I just

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:58,639
don't like it for philosophical or

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,999
theoretical reasons that in theory any

00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:08,690
didi can upload anything and it will hit

00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:11,029
the archives and of course we do it to

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,700
provide long-term support so we will not

00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:16,340
we don't plan to break it right that is

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,690
a potential user of this if you're

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,850
telling me as a maintainer of the

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,799
project now I am uncomfortable with

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,389
running unrestricted upgrades on the LTS

00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,860
I'm saying well I will just take with

00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:29,090
them into and I would be much more

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,119
enthusiastic about switching some

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,649
systems from it - Debian if you said

00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,210
yeah I'm gonna change it so not every

00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:36,619
deacon up already sir there is review or

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,019
whatever it takes to get to the point

00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:40,730
where you don't say oh it's too fragile

00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:41,910
to be part of the regular stable

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:48,510
distribution which

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:50,490
because it might break something that's

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:54,930
not how it's done at the moment we want

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:58,440
we want to have lower barrier of entry

00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:04,410
sure so let's but I think we should

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:10,110
change that okay but this is my opinion

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:12,990
at the moment is there any activity on

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,750
fundraising for us yes or is that I mean

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:23,210
because you said that was not that much

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:26,900
money raised at the moment and there is

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:33,720
companies are being approached

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:35,990
individually and yeah okay so there's

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,320
not not as far as I know not a conscious

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,970
consult action plan can you say worried

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,370
about how the bugs are supposed to be

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:48,860
done is that the same as backports akka

00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:52,770
we made two lists or step bugs

00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:57,200
configured to work with old stable LTS

00:20:52,770 --> 00:21:00,860
them the Box works was all stay was too

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,860
and there are no bugs

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,579
[Music]

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:15,940
so I've seen just monitoring the the

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,590
back parts list over the last couple of

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,700
months they've been numerous packages

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:23,650
where where dependencies aren't met

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,980
where there are all sorts of problems

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,200
and I think back ports desperately needs

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,390
a staging area and it seems kind of

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,040
absurd to think something even more

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:37,720
targeted at a stable wouldn't have some

00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,730
sort of stating area and it sounded like

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,900
you you were amenable to that but I I'm

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:45,850
kind of yeah I don't know I just figured

00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,679
I'd mentioned like well nothing's

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,380
happened yet but there's also a lot

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,020
fewer uploads than with like back ports

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,880
which is kind of improving that model in

00:21:53,020 --> 00:22:04,300
my opinion doesn't work very well

00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:06,730
I agree although I will uh I will argue

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:10,270
a bit earlier to the other side back

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,309
ports are meant to to disrupt it is in

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:15,040
some way they're introducing new

00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:17,170
versions LTS is not introducing

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,550
introducing new versions just patching

00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:26,080
so it should not should not break

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:28,590
anything it's just less likely to not

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,590
should not

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,679
LTS no solution appraised minute version

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:41,679
upgrades but yeah like security or the

00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:44,470
security doesn't a sacrament security

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,960
does as well there is post process also

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:55,660
another example of package spread which

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:58,270
gets even not for packages well so post

00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,490
Chris got whitelist by the security team

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:03,270
for minor version of crates right and

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,950
actually we from credit chief plan on

00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,320
providing further support for Postgres

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:10,980
if possible because it also ran out an

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,690
upstream but we're working on that

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,440
just as an information it's not really

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:19,110
um announced or anything but we try to

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,640
do that but isn't there another it

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,830
shouldn't it be a list from the security

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,140
team which packages have been a proof or

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:28,320
whitelist for minor version upgrades and

00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,400
that should be taking over - LTS I mean

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:37,050
I think that would be the sensible

00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:38,670
approach it sounds to me a little from

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,880
this discussion that we need a clear

00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:44,340
policy on what we're doing well yes in

00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,380
terms of are we trying to avoid minor

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,330
version upgrades wherever possible or

00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,070
you know something like that it seems

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,200
like there's a bit of uncertainty about

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,950
exactly what we're trying to do with LTS

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,800
may we'd a clearly stated policy of you

00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,510
know when do we do bug fixes or when do

00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,800
we allow minor version of gate because

00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:06,750
this does seem to be a lack of clarity

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:12,090
about that the policy follows the

00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:15,510
security team policy mostly and maybe

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:20,309
it's good idea to do it a bit more

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:22,580
relaxed um later because then I don't

00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:22,580
know

00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:30,430
but you're all invited to voice your

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:33,050
concerns on the mailing list because

00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,990
what's been said here is were most

00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,069
likely to be forgotten

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,069
[Music]

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:52,400
your find work script is this is a

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,030
public repo no that would be a good

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,030
start I guess

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,900
[Music]

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:18,100
will there be a exact date given for how

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:22,780
long each say Weezy for instance would

00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:26,830
be supported in advance so that people

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:31,480
can plan on how long the LTS we support

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:33,430
it no because then it's not fully clear

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,560
way how long busy will be supported

00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:39,910
because that is dependent on the Jesse

00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:43,510
release date swing but maybe something

00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:45,820
vague like so once it comes out then

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,650
five years or something like that's the

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,720
plan roughly yeah okay and it's quite

00:25:47,650 --> 00:26:06,460
clear when Jeezy Jesse will be released

00:25:49,720 --> 00:26:10,660
more or less hopefully yeah so till 2021

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:19,530
not 21 just turn on Jesse will be

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:19,530
supported them 2018

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:37,530
if there are no more questions you can

00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,530
