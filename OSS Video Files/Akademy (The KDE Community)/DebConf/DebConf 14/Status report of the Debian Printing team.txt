great so welcome to the only talk of

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,069
this time span I'm glad I'm the only one

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,040
talking I hope that would be somewhat

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,549
interesting that's a great honor to be

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,139
the only one talking so I wanted to just

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,750
do a status report of the Debian

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,369
printing team because it's been quite a

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,490
long time I've been working in this part

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,920
of Devon and I've tried to attract

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,930
people into helping me for printing in

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,960
the last years and it hasn't really

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,020
worked so I'll just do another attempt

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,640
and see what that gives and probably and

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,180
hopefully give you some insight on how

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,420
the whole thing work so a little

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,000
introduction about me I'm a Swiss guy

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,410
and working I was basically grown up

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,450
with computers if you follow my talk

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,670
from last year I showed you some of the

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:57,899
Swiss computers back then in some

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:59,550
motorola 68000 swiss specific stuff that

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,039
was basically born with and I'm

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,049
currently working at at leap ch it's a

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,530
Swiss company there's websites and I'm

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,610
working there as a learning specialists

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,180
web apps back Heller and sysadmin

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,220
whatever that means towards Debian I've

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,799
been translating things that you've been

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,500
decide since 2005 maintaining packages

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,979
since 2009 I've been a developer since

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,140
2011 and maintaining some packages since

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,470
then that's not the most interesting

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,060
part of that talk so let's go forward

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,560
this sessions intense is to present the

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,560
state of the Debian printing stack it's

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,170
the evaluation evolution until today the

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,850
leftover work and also how I got trapped

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,670
into maintaining that part of Debian I

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,149
mean I don't have particular interests

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,700
in printers but yeah and how you can

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,950
help

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,630
so the let's dive into the past if you

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,890
have questions just raise your hand and

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,590
interrupting you don't feel shy so it

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,380
started in June 2010 I adopted from

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,590
attic filters because it was severely

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,210
outdated then there was no upload for a

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,979
year missing five years upstream

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,009
releases we were lagging lagging

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,050
severely behind Ubuntu and the

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,770
maintainer was quasi mi a typical case

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,040
for adopting

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,660
package some months before the freeze I

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,810
was kind of looking for things to help

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:25,140
the the freeze out and this was broken

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,260
on my machine and that's where the trap

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,390
was working me first it just made it

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,430
into sweet squeeze because I did you

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,380
upload like three hours after the freeze

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,890
was surprise announced that's the DEP

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,600
confident so I managed to get it through

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,580
somehow but that was the only package I

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:47,130
was maintaining there for squeeze and

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:48,900
then in July I sent this request for

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,870
comments for forming a printing task

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,590
force to enviros mailing lists the cups

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,970
the containers lists etc to see if it

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,130
was possible to gather some people

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,870
around maintaining the whole printed

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,000
stack and her team umbrella because

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,580
before that it was just sets of packages

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,280
maintained by individuals on their own

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,410
side of Debian the thing was kind of

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,780
working but as soon as people went mi a

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,380
or just had other interests than the

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,750
packages were rotting and then I started

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,330
integrating the Ubuntu Delta into Debian

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,550
because you brew had apparently more

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,830
than needs then Debian to have a working

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,750
printing infrastructure then and they

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,040
had been fixing this stuff on their on

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,630
their side so it's interesting to take a

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,260
look at the Ubuntu Delta in the first

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,510
place why there was one one one argument

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,910
for that is that the updates were not

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,950
proposed back to Debian at all so no

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,220
patches sent to the back to the bar

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,110
tracker no other way than just looking

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,880
at the packages in Ubuntu and see well

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,100
there was there were updates there so I

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,030
should maybe take the patches back but

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,530
there was no upward communication and on

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,480
the other hand the packages were not

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,970
getting any or much attention in Debian

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,570
either so no one was actually taking a

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,970
look at this diff and making sure that

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:11,400
things were working I mean it was

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,220
working for some parts but many bugs

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,900
still but it's still through software so

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,060
patches were sitting there you had a

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,390
nice link from the pts who actually gets

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,100
one big patch you could apply to you to

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,140
dive in package and you could just

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,510
integrate that so the patches were

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,730
available it was not that

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,820
that so the work started at the

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:36,330
beginning of the wizzy cycle around 2010

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:40,020
to tell 2011 by making basically

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:42,480
adopting new packages and publishing the

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,850
Ubuntu changes like taking one change at

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,760
a time making one clean commit out of

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,740
that and uploading releases one after

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,780
the other integrating your upstream

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,090
releases and oh good enough well not

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,430
exactly because the the dependency stack

00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:03,150
at that time was a little complicated so

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:05,550
to say because every package was linking

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,560
against its dependencies and some of the

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,840
drivers had been promoted to the print

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,050
server tasks so the print server task

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,030
was pulling like HP lip and guten print

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,450
but not other drivers for some reason

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:21,210
and it was pulling cups and her cups was

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:24,450
pulling poplar and then yeah that

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,550
basically you can go on the wiki if you

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,310
want to revise history but basically

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:33,290
that's why that's what was there when I

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,580
started cleaning up the stuff so I

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,700
started discussing the thing on the list

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,160
and it was like we were like two or

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:44,730
three and maybe many people agreeing to

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:48,090
the thing but I was I was not many for

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:50,940
doing the thing so I started cleaning up

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,130
the dust renaming the drivers now all

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,430
printer driver are namespaced somehow

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,870
they all start with the same binary name

00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,790
we're working the dependencies tree

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,370
making sure you have a printer driver

00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,740
all that just recommends all driver

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,710
available drivers that the print print

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,390
task can depend on so you get you get by

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,430
default you get all available free

00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,730
software drivers just in case you might

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:18,780
want to install a printer there was this

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:21,870
PYP PD that is compressor that would

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:24,960
take the PPD files and turn them into an

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,750
X Z compressed Python script that will

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,440
uncompress itself into DVDs that

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:36,210
basically allows disk space reduction of

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:39,420
80% that was written by during a google

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,310
Summer of Code and I just wrote their

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,870
own D H wrapper around that too

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,410
to my dad for their printing packages so

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,670
that if you put the PPT files in the

00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,710
right place and run that tool it will

00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,740
just do the compression and replacement

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,660
and removing in the correct place we

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,970
have moved all the packages to kids

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,760
because some of them were in Novus yes

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:02,010
some of them were in SVN I don't think

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,510
we had any in CVS but anyway moving

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,120
ticket was a good thing in collab means

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,600
by then because I didn't have interest

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,370
in making a proper team namespace and I

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,530
wanted probably easier to just put

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,760
everything there in the worst that might

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,680
happen is that someone would be

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,980
interested in putting patches that

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,980
didn't happen and we hijacked the

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,110
tagging printing list because no one was

00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,620
using that and it was totally logical to

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,640
use that as a maintainer list to put do

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,910
you have everything in the same place

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:40,670
and cleaner cleaning up the dependencies

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:43,890
apparently that's twice in the slide so

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,800
during that time we managed to package

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,360
all known free software drivers there

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,220
were some laying around that were not

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,260
packaged some that were a little

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,080
complicated to package but anyway we I

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,060
try to search through open printing and

00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,550
whatever and find some others that were

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,920
not packaged that were maybe supporting

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,480
one or two printers but I wonder is

00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,430
probably good to have them in dev in any

00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,760
way it could be useful for one one or

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:11,310
two users no consolidated the thematic

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,040
pack packaging and cut back on upstream

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:19,320
versions and I think in wizzy we had

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,910
most of that but there's still cups cups

00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,320
is like the thing you don't really want

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,300
to touch when you do printing because

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,490
that's actually the complicated part the

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,690
rest is just drivers filters small

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,330
programs it's easy when you start

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,070
packaging because it's small things in

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:36,750
different languages it's funny but cups

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:39,630
is a little frightening so I wondered

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,580
yeah I mean cups is it's is one big

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,830
thing and it has an apple upstream I

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,170
mean you had it's not really the thing

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,540
you want to touch in cups this is not

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:53,560
really known for being super whatever

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:56,199
free software friendly so yeah what

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,290
the receivers was upcoming and cops

00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:01,240
hadn't seen uploads for a year so I

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,240
started fixing one thing after the other

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,639
and I starting uploading enemies and I

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,170
ended up doing 16 nm years in a row and

00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,269
not every enemy who got a freeze

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,550
exception request but almost all of them

00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:17,139
so for each of the enemies was then

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,459
discussing was the release team of the

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:26,740
changes to make sure they would enter

00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:29,860
enter wizzy yeah that and then 2013 cups

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,660
was especially made complicated by the

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,699
fact that where there was no public VCS

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,399
that are used to be in SVN but it was

00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,990
down for some reason it also used to be

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,779
a public back tracker but it was down

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,269
for some reason and the few contacts I

00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,490
had with Apple was just over private

00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:49,019
males because they had no mailing lists

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,220
or it was closed or it was down or yeah

00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,079
so it's not exactly the upstream your

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,029
very fine working with I mean it's just

00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,399
a black hole you just get a new Tarble

00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,899
no changes I mean you get a change lock

00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,079
but I mean you don't get the individual

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:05,290
changes so and of course the package

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:10,930
back then had no testitude working had

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:13,180
no outer package test so yeah that but

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,920
finally after doing sex 16 enemies I

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,980
think I thought myself yeah

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,389
what what does that mean any the real

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,009
maintainer would not get back to your

00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:22,870
loading that for the stable release so I

00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:25,569
might as well just adopt it and we'll

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,850
see what happens so apparently the trap

00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:34,779
worked I ended up with one more big

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:38,769
package that's cups so where do we stand

00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:41,079
now if you run CID you probably have

00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:44,800
most packages that are in their most

00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,959
recent upstream version and the last

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,240
year we moved from co-op mains to

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,179
printing because it's now easier because

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,699
I'm a DD so I could easily create a new

00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:56,529
Alice group and we thought it's also

00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:59,889
easier just to see who was actually

00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:01,959
actually in the team so we send a salon

00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:03,759
to mail to the various persons that had

00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:06,910
somehow contributed and asked them to

00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,080
request the membership on alia so that

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,970
the ones that are just

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,310
is don't request and they're not members

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:16,750
so that the list on alia is somewhat

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:19,570
relevant we kind of managed to maintain

00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,120
the bug flow at a reasonable level I

00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,070
started there was like 400 bucks and now

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,090
we're around 300 but that means also

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:31,720
that the new bugs are addressed in it

00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:34,990
within a reasonable delay somehow so now

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,370
that I told already twice the floss

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,340
drivers are in Debian there was a new

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:42,160
one I think three months ago some some

00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,720
guys did some driver for two or three

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,920
brother printers that just works

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,060
apparently so

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,400
we package that is it's in Debian also

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,440
the Ubuntu defense kept minimal we've

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,990
integrated some of the Ubuntu specific

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,660
changes in the Debian packaging just to

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,850
avoid having them create a new tip just

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,920
or maintaining a diff over time you can

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,100
do that easily with dpkg vendor for

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,530
example so you have every package the

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,390
package is the same just that build time

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,670
we'll go do different things so you can

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,860
for example the default PDF page is

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,750
different and the two default pages are

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,980
in the Debian package but when you build

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,710
it on your bundle you get the Ubuntu

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,300
default page it has the advantage that

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,860
you want to employ you don't have to

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,730
kind of incremental you don't have to

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,910
maintain that patch over time we managed

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,190
to get the diff to zero sometimes it's

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,870
sometimes you just see a peek in Ubuntu

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:39,010
because there you want to be faster than

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:42,430
in the music and they do their stuff so

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,980
that's the bugs it's for all printing

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,870
packages it's not that bad

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,660
frankly I had to do actual work for my

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:55,690
work in July and August so it froze a

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:58,570
little yeah so cups as you might have

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:01,510
noticed if you're googling it now we've

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:06,090
gone from 1 5 3 that was in squeeze to

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:09,880
175 now and Jessie so it's two minor

00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:12,460
upstream releases with quite a lot of

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,270
changes and I think we packaged all

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,830
intermediate versions and it's not bold

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,960
to say that we'll see we will release

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:24,380
with a minor version of one 7

00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:28,370
I mean Jessie yes thank you

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:30,830
I'm getting old we've been able to

00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,240
pull test suits so lots of patches

00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,990
within the test suit but not for

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,370
disabling things mostly for ignoring

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,550
things in the error logs because cops

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:43,520
test test suite will count the number of

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,959
errors in its error log so you have to

00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,700
take things out so that the count always

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,760
matches outer package test

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,410
it's basically printing to Devin all but

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,930
we had we test that this continues to

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,000
work when other parts of the of the

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:02,000
archive change so printing to that now

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,100
works that's good news and we've patched

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,290
in the system D socket activation and

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,529
activity timeout so the socket

00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:12,890
activation was originally from Leonard

00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:16,130
and then changed by Gen 2 to have that

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:18,950
not mandatory because gantu also has his

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,779
V in it where Red Hat just has system D

00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,120
so they don't have an option at runtime

00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:25,400
to either activate or deactivate the

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,410
socket activation so it's a mix of the

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,620
Red Hat patch plus the gun to patch plus

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,740
cleaning it was the activity timeout was

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:38,270
from Ubuntu so basically now insid if

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,860
you run system D or app start after 30

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,900
seconds of not doing anything the cap

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,209
server will shut down itself and it

00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,529
doesn't do anything and when you print

00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,589
something or access the web interface

00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:51,040
over the 6-3 one port just launches

00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:53,720
itself in a quarter of a second and

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:59,089
printers prints and then after 30

00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:01,610
seconds shuts down again as for upstream

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:03,770
we have regular good and constructive

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:09,320
contact with upstream I mean they have

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:10,910
again public VCS sorry a public VCS box

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,010
repository so we can actually

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,850
communicate on the public place and have

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:21,079
the virus changes also as individual

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,970
units so it's quite easier than now as

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:26,209
for the constructive contacts I also had

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,760
good private emails with Mike Michael

00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:31,040
sweet from Apple about this new TLS

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,769
versus open SSL discussion we had in

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,449
Debian level some months ago because

00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:38,670
let's introduce some incompatibilities

00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:41,069
so I thought yeah I could just build

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,589
against OpenSSL no problem caps has the

00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:46,290
GPL 2 exception and it was rightly

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:48,269
pointed out that every package that uses

00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,540
leap cops 2 also needs the GPL 2

00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:53,850
exception for open SSL so it wasn't

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,769
really possible so we had the discussion

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,420
and actually Absalom was interested in

00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:00,389
fighting finding a solution eventually

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,089
patching in another SSL library if that

00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:04,529
would help the Linux distributor so it

00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:05,989
was kind of surprising for me that Apple

00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:09,689
would be interested in doing that but

00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:12,299
they were I'm saying so that's good and

00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:13,860
now we dropped the open SSL and it just

00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:20,730
builds against the latest new TLS

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:22,559
version but yeah the Linux Foundation

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,600
still needs to nineteen several things

00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,579
that got dropped from cups

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,559
that's one drawback of having cups owned

00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:30,360
by Apple is that they basically dropped

00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,489
everything that was not interesting to

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,259
them so they just want to make sure you

00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:37,379
can print on Apple certified printers

00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:41,160
and rest is left up to the community so

00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:44,160
the Linux Foundation took over the caps

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,660
filters and the cups broadcasting

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,029
management's you can have the

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,670
announcement between cup servers to get

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,679
the queues in your local queue etcetera

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:56,189
etcetera so that's taken over by the New

00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,660
York Sunday ssin I'm thankful they do

00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,230
that job I'm happy I don't have to do it

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,619
myself

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,409
because I it probably wouldn't work and

00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:06,089
till competitor is working for them

00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:08,569
making that happen so I'm glad he does

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,569
thank you

00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:14,220
we also have some people helping I would

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,049
like to thank Brian Potkin in particular

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,370
for being precise tireless and helpful I

00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:19,589
don't know if he's at that conference

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:23,819
he's being participating on the lists

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:26,909
quite a lot for taking down some bugs

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:32,880
reporting some useful bugs preparing

00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:34,500
patches also it has been useful and you

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,630
might have seen from the list of

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,299
packages we also have other packages

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,490
that I don't maintain myself but there

00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,590
are also in the Devon printing team so

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:48,060
we have Jonas for a course kryptonite

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:51,960
yes C 2050 by Marco Cubs

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:55,950
the GNP by Joe mean twelve x6w by Stefan

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,540
and T four cups by Mike that it's not

00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,150
practice it doesn't that move very often

00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:03,110
but when they do there we have update so

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,110
it's good thank you

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,350
in other part of the stack we still have

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:11,220
HP Lib that is maintained independently

00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:13,680
by a Mart person and also gets updated

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,230
regularly so it's fine and cups PDF

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:21,780
biometallic and apparently is working

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:23,460
too so thanks now for the future scoping

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,640
the problem non-free blog and some

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,530
incoming challenges the problem of

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,060
printing is that it's it still must be

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,950
of our world when you discuss with

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,810
people some people say yeah cups is is

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,860
really and we should find we could

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,500
just drop that from the default

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:41,040
installation yeah you know people still

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,490
print I mean the non paper world is

00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,910
probably in the advertisement but it's

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,590
not there at all

00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:52,590
printing when it works it's boring it

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:55,560
just has to work and but when it doesn't

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,470
it's really annoying so it's it's that

00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,850
type of technical challenges that you

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,010
will only get complains when it doesn't

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:05,100
and when it does everyone is happy but

00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:08,610
no bugs no nothing it just works and

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,740
it's fine but on the other hand printing

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,450
is damn complex printer manufacturers

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,790
come up with new protocols every three

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,860
months basically like they can I even

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,680
change printing protocols within the

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,620
same product suit some reason you get

00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,320
different IPP versions PCL supports

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,690
different memory requirements now you

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,640
can directly feed PDFs to printers but

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,290
the printers will sometime fail because

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,370
the internal PDF rendering will fails

00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,470
for some reason so you have to

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,960
circumvent that in the printer drivers

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,790
you also have different sending

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,910
protocols err prints the Google Cloud

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:44,340
Print is coming we have now IPP over USB

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,920
for some printers so it's like an ever

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,170
changing landscape for printing I mean

00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,790
it's a thing we've been doing for years

00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,790
and it's still changing for some reason

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,930
it's complex also because it takes any

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,390
format as input basically you can print

00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,830
images Word documents PDFs

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,740
PostScript

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,330
and you have to make sure transform to

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,190
whatever the printer is ready to get

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,830
sometimes this PostScript sometimes this

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:14,070
PDF sometimes it some raw whatever

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:17,429
sometimes it's a bit stream so we have

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,720
complex chains and one of the biggest

00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:20,399
problem is that when a user has a

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,740
problem the probability is one that you

00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:25,019
don't have the printer I mean I have one

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,539
printer at home I test it when I do new

00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:29,760
uploads and I just printed the test page

00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,320
and that works but when it when a guy

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:38,159
has a problem on a printer I don't have

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:40,740
it so it's quite hard to reproduce and

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,370
there is still I pee in the drivers and

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,260
I mean we have full manufacturer suits

00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,510
that have no acceptable floor support

00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:52,860
and I will do something appointing now I

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:55,470
hope this is not videotaped oh

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,750
we've had this project from Devon France

00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,789
for the they were basically offering

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,620
books for people that would be happy to

00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:04,049
contribute to something and I mentor two

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:06,659
guys to take a look at what brother is

00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:09,090
that is doing with the drivers so I

00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:12,779
invite you to go there the documentation

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,820
is quite extensive and they try to see

00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:16,919
how we could package that even in

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:21,330
non-free just to consolidate the thing

00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,250
and have a somewhat clean dump of files

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,010
even in non-free that you would install

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:30,059
that instead of downloading mm to dab

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:31,200
that has no depth ops but the webpage is

00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,630
layout changed in the middle of the

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,250
project they just revamp the website so

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,600
we had a crawler that would get the

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,720
virus driver and it just changed

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,789
completely and then we left the project

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,789
you have is for some printers you have

00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:47,279
two different versions either for SI or

00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:49,620
imperial units because I don't know

00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,559
printers have physik different physical

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,750
size or I don't know you have seashell

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,480
all over the place I don't think we have

00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:01,559
any valid in seashell interpreter yet in

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,120
the in Debian for many drivers is there

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,669
is no Co installation possible because

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,039
they use the same name files with

00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:10,350
different contents in the same place so

00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,240
you need the different file but it with

00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,590
the same name the same place for two

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,909
different printers so basically you can

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,760
either print to one or the other but not

00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:19,890
two

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:23,490
it still uses print cap that's been

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:26,550
deprecated at least since H I didn't

00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:29,070
check with something very old and yeah

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:32,610
there's a lot of bugs all over the place

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:35,250
its loads and loads of shellcodes

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:37,010
that would unpack parts of PPD files to

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,390
generate things to put in other places

00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:45,180
downloads things from the internet yeah

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:47,220
a whole lot of crap frankly but yeah I

00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,230
mean we should not only figure point at

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,600
brother Samsung reps on there doing

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,190
exactly the same or worse or I just

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,500
didn't take a look precisely at that but

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,030
the brother project was quite

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:05,430
frightening and I don't think we will

00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:31,230
ever do something useful there I don't

00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:34,650
know if that's surprise so yeah that's

00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:37,380
that's the dark the dark corner we don't

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,750
want to to see I mean we have the three

00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,600
drivers that work quite well and there's

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,430
a whole lot of things in the dark corner

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,230
that you don't want to buy these

00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:48,210
printers because there's no way to make

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,230
them work reasonably unless you download

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:54,270
some very very very old Debian package

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,740
fix the depth sums inside and stuff like

00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,590
that

00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:02,390
for Jesse new things go scripts move to

00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:04,680
a GPL that makes some people very happy

00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,930
so what we'll do is we'll probably

00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,570
upload an on the latest non a GPL

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:12,570
version and have that in Jesse and we'll

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:15,960
probably see what happens then because

00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:18,090
yeah the freeze is soon and it's quite a

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,940
complex problem and we won't have time

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:23,430
to fix that before so we'll probably

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,820
move some versions up but not to the

00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:28,710
latest option option version apparently

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,570
we're the only ones to care all other

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:37,620
tribution have just uploaded the a GPL

00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:40,080
version and it's there so yeah cuffs to

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,850
0 is around the corner we hope it will

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,480
get there by the end the end of the year

00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:48,409
it introduces a stream side assist in

00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,990
these reports TLS certificate validation

00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:54,330
maybe it's time for for us to do that

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,000
they removed to open SSL support and we

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,890
have many OS X and n enhance

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,549
enhancements whatever that is useful for

00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:04,950
us anyway that's so expects 2-0 better

00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:11,760
one in experimental in the next month

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:13,679
we'll see so what you can do frankly I'm

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,770
getting bored by all that it's been

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:20,580
years not of I've been maintaining the

00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:23,640
printing stack not exactly alone but for

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,350
some parts quite alone it's true to say

00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,970
that I've got quite a lot of

00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,159
collaboration with Ubuntu to make that

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,720
work and there are many things that is

00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,330
that I just have to patch back into

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,740
Debian and it just works but it's it's

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:40,919
sometimes a little boring to do that all

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,779
alone and yeah I'm glad others are

00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,770
helping in the team but for the most

00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:48,890
part part likely cups it's not that easy

00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:53,159
but it's not too complicated believe me

00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:54,899
trust me and one point is I'm very bad

00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,789
at motivating people or documenting

00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:59,880
processes for example the team's page

00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:02,429
I probably edited it twice once in 2010

00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,130
and once last year for the printing buff

00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:06,510
and it's still sitting there with no

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,390
many not many updates

00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:12,390
so someone motivated by processes

00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:15,240
documentation should jump jump on the

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,520
ship and do some stuff there but this

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,899
talk was an attempt at motivating people

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,809
at least so let's see that works and on

00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:26,610
a long-term what we need is more drivers

00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:29,279
right writers basically because there

00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:32,789
are tons of printers that come out that

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,679
don't get full support and that people

00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:37,289
use basically and the problem is not

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,330
making sure everyone can buy the printer

00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:41,399
they want people will have printers they

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,450
have their and they want that work and

00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,429
it doesn't

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:48,359
so we need people to actually write

00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:51,090
driver printers we need more bug

00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:55,859
managers that then become one of you

00:26:51,090 --> 00:27:00,210
maintains hopefully and less bugs pretty

00:26:55,859 --> 00:27:02,309
please we can achieve less bugs two ways

00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,999
by fixing more bugs or by introducing

00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:07,980
less bugs so maybe we should do the two

00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:11,279
so that's all for my little type in

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,779
printing stack status if you have

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,389
questions I'm happy to try to answer

00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:31,919
them and otherwise I think we can all

00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:33,269
move to dinner yeah where's the mics so

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,739
I'm a bit interested in printing because

00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:36,629
we have lots of corporate printing which

00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:38,489
doesn't work because it's all run for

00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:40,889
Windows people and so the poor linux

00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:42,269
people are thoroughly ignored and in

00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:45,059
fact if we printed the printers they

00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:46,470
tend to crash which is a bit sad and you

00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,639
know people complain that the printers

00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,789
are very unreliable and you actually

00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:51,929
does so 50% chance of things exploding

00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:54,629
but what I what I haven't been able to

00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:56,759
find is where do people who have to

00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:58,350
worry about corporate installations hang

00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,480
out I couldn't find anywhere to ask

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,499
questions because our IT people go we

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,929
don't know how it's supposed to work in

00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:05,309
linux world we have no idea

00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,869
please tell us what to do and we'll do

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:10,289
that and I don't know anything about

00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:13,200
printing or who to ask or where to go is

00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,700
there a place I think there must be lots

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,379
of people who have big installations

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,649
from me and there must be some people

00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:21,749
who understand how this works so the

00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:23,820
Debian printing list is not that much

00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:26,129
used it gets the automated mails from

00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,200
the maintainer male so we could drop

00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:30,450
that if people start to use that but

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,879
that would be one option I think you

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,609
should look into open printing lists and

00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:36,960
if no list exists there they should

00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:39,779
probably create one I think they have

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,179
one they have summits and they have

00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:43,769
meetings or whatever printing related

00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,139
somewhere on the open printing so it'd

00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:46,769
be a good place to yeah I think that's

00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:49,460
great advice

00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:49,460
yeah ok

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,059
um I was just wondering if you would

00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,890
comment on what's your what's your

00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,559
perspective on back ports and things

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:09,169
like that so once we go stable how do

00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:12,990
you see supporting the printing stack

00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:17,279
for two years five years however long

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:19,520
stable is gonna be out there mmm well

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,260
there are two answers for that one is

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:26,130
there's quite a lot of security work to

00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:31,080
do for stable already and we had I think

00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:32,429
privileged yeah you could access

00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,830
basically you could ya privilege

00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:37,980
escalation in stable so we had to rerun

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:40,970
the whole configuration system in stable

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,990
four cups during the weazy cycle so that

00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,419
kind of takes the time that would be

00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:50,130
allocated to back ports the other answer

00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:52,230
is patches welcome so I didn't do black

00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,409
ports for wheezy yet just because there

00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:57,179
are had enough of mine plates force it

00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:59,610
but I would happily help anyone wanting

00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,630
to prepare back parts I think it

00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,990
shouldn't be too hard

00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:06,870
cops is probably buildable right away so

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:09,929
yeah that's oh that's cups how about the

00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:12,299
how about drivers so saying I mean if

00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:15,090
anyone interested I could just help

00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:17,429
making sure it happens but it's unlikely

00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:29,010
I would do it myself let's do it so

00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:30,870
thank you so if you do not do new

00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:34,169
drivers typically depend on a new

00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:37,230
version of cops usually not because they

00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:41,220
build against lip cups too but lip cups

00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:46,950
too is kind of a bi-stable since years

00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:54,840
so it shouldn't be too much so that said

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:57,720
any you so the missing hardware support

00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,610
is a is as I understand it's always

00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,919
considered an important part and worthy

00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:05,159
of a stable update so that means that if

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:10,050
you wanted to you could you could update

00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:13,020
drivers add new drivers in staple

00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:17,190
for hardware enablement that's

00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:20,210
interesting yeah the other I also had a

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:24,050
question about drivers which is

00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:30,560
typically when I plug into a new printer

00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:33,060
I get a list of possible drivers

00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,180
possibly limited to the exact model or

00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:39,270
not but there are always seem to be more

00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,410
than one option power model is that I

00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,240
see much because there are multiple

00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:44,550
collections of drivers at the package

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:49,680
how was it user am I supposed to decide

00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:54,840
which is which of those to use trial and

00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:56,400
attempt I mean they for some driver for

00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,220
some printers you get a recommended

00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,320
version from thematic that has this part

00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:05,220
is this recommended thing so you should

00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,960
just pick that one I think we mostly

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,050
also have multiple drivers per printer

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,610
because sometimes for a single printer

00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,650
depending on where in the world it was

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:17,850
it would work better or worse with

00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:19,470
different printer drivers so but the the

00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,240
one database that we use for that is

00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:27,030
formatic DB that is maintained on the

00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:28,770
open printing website and the where

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,840
exactly you should report bugs isn't

00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:33,420
exactly clear also for me so I should

00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,070
clarify that well I've never I've never

00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:39,300
selected a driver and found that it

00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:40,830
didn't work so as far as I'm concerned

00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,330
you're doing fine there it's simply use

00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:45,480
this haven't been presented with a

00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:47,610
choice well I haven't I don't know what

00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,980
would the difference would be was that

00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:51,750
under cops web interface yes yeah I

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,190
think that there the selection isn't

00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:56,670
very smart but I think when you use

00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,850
Python cups or one of the Konami or

00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:01,200
crazy front ends you get a little less

00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:03,210
options I think but that's more a

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,930
front-end work than whatever cups

00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:13,880
related but yeah I don't have a better

00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:13,880
answer now any other questions

00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,420
kind of following on from what Ben said

00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,250
yeah I been under the impression that

00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,230
those were different ways of talking to

00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,510
the printer you know because there's

00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,700
always at least 17 ways of talking to

00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,890
any given printer so I kind of thought

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,510
that they were all different flavors but

00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,770
again it's extremely unclear you go I

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,470
don't know whether I want formatic

00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,730
thingy or OHP lip thingy or something

00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,740
else thing I just let you try what and

00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,840
usually it works you know and you go I

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,950
could sit here in trial seventeen but I

00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,720
don't know whether this and then

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,220
sometimes there's the interface to the

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,330
printer you could specify so our fancy

00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,950
print in the office there's eighty-one

00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,350
different ways of talking to it and you

00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,900
go I don't want to try all those you

00:33:54,350 --> 00:34:00,170
know with the floor I've tried all make

00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:04,130
it crash but you know sometimes in one

00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:05,270
that works yeah exactly yeah but there

00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,160
seem to be a very small number people

00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:10,130
actually understand this stuff yes that

00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:14,060
this till yeah maybe three other people

00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:18,590
somewhere yeah right so but he's yeah we

00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:20,630
should talk more to till and yeah he's

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:24,980
making most of that work under you

00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:26,690
wouldn't decide employee what's the

00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,950
state he kept that that the cups

00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,470
browsing thing as you say has

00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:33,620
disappeared upstream so we're keeping it

00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:40,760
in a Debian Ubuntu while we can yes that

00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:42,169
right yes using thing let's hope that's

00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,220
her Apple wanted to work but that

00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:44,450
doesn't know what it is especially in a

00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,679
big office that doesn't work at all

00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,899
because you're on different network

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,970
segments one thing that was dropped in

00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:52,220
that hasn't been reintroduced on open

00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,530
printing was the LDAP support there was

00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,929
or they used to be in cups and that's

00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,450
now removed I was used in big

00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,790
corporations that had like an LDAP list

00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,290
of printers instead of like listening to

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,330
the noise of all printers announcing

00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,940
themselves on our network and we

00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:10,460
regularly get users saying how could I

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:14,060
pick the latest one was something like

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,710
the browsing demon has 10% CPU is that

00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:22,250
because I have 100 printers of my office

00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:24,140
well yes so yeah I mean I can't really I

00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,960
don't even have a capacity of recording

00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:29,570
that anyway so if big corporation wants

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,620
to get a lot soup or they should make

00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:34,510
the fix yes

00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:37,900
but I'm open to interpreting that as a

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:42,340
debian patch if that helps but I can't

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:43,720
really fix that myself so yeah if at any

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,850
time I'd like to help you with printing

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,980
but I have too many hats already so I'm

00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:51,700
not member I'm seeing anything yeah

00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:53,440
thank you mostly so I can actually print

00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,850
stuff without having to run Windows VM

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,660
which in practice is how I printed my

00:35:54,850 --> 00:36:01,420
stuff to get here yeah it's bad

00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:03,670
actually one one thing that that geeks

00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,960
like us should know is how to pick the

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,540
correct printer and we knew you when you

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,860
buy one I think yeah so my home print

00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,690
does all work fine it's beautiful that

00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,340
cups browsing works stuff prints it's

00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,480
all lovely it's when you go to work the

00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:23,950
whole thing's a disaster

00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:27,550
yeah so which manufacturer should we

00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:29,680
prefer I'm not paid by any of these but

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,690
I think HP printers mostly work fine

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:37,900
either through HP lpe

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:42,490
HP iyp or other things yeah that's phase

00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:46,090
line I would say but yeah others work

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:48,370
too well if anyone has contacts that

00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:50,410
brother tell me to contact me and we'll

00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:52,930
manage something and recommend some good

00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,820
practices for modern printing if you

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:57,030
know because that's not an acceptable

00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:00,870
way of providing a learning support I

00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:05,110
think anyway other questions

00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:07,320
everyone's hungry good thank you very

00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,320
