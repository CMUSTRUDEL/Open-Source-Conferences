	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:07,350
with enough time that they can still do

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:09,630
it if they didn't do it yet but they

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,150
feel motivated to do it for the meeting

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,599
yeah something like that so it's like

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,390
one person that has the specific role of

00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:21,240
finding people and that's the only role

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:25,109
but I think it's very important because

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,740
we tend to I don't know I think most

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,570
people tend to be but a prioritizing and

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,090
then say yeah this is something that

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,090
will only take me two hours and it keeps

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,140
then the time when it should have been

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,050
done comes and it was not done so like

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,879
having someone mail you one asking you

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,579
what's going do you think we will make

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,829
it

00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:55,949
so long as they choose someone who has

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,520
the right tone yes it has to be someone

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,350
with shoppin skis but it also has to be

00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,400
accepted by the team that this person

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,930
has a strong I it's not personal it's

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:14,620
it's a help for the whole functioning

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:16,910
off the team yeah so it was my idea I

00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,680
think that's a good idea I think we

00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,540
should propose it to the meaningless and

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:27,470
that we discussed this today and that

00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:32,990
you want to be that person so at least

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:39,619
when we did it in Argentina it was as a

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:52,430
glorified this allowed this person to do

00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:54,770
this very well since I'm planning on

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,410
taking other things I could prepare

00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,780
other person to take it should we ask

00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:02,899
the mailing list anybody wants to do

00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,990
this or we have anyone particular in

00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:04,990
mind

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,480
and I think we should send the email

00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,160
list and explained us are there any

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,590
questions or objections in this round I

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,689
don't think so

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,939
consensus maybe ask for volunteers to be

00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:25,340
sent to someone like sent tomorrow or

00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:53,629
something at that you can G always kind

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:56,090
of yeah producing change with time so

00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:58,310
for example I don't know the sponsorship

00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,959
or something that was being done as soon

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,000
as it's finished it's finished so you

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,109
don't need to think about it anymore and

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,109
you can

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,190
this I see that's a new volunteer

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,099
someone that just arrived on the team

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:23,310
then you can fix we need to take this

00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:26,280
home but not some others already so we

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:29,340
know what to do um are there any other

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,420
ideas from teams that they would like to

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:36,330
discuss like CC 15 members or even

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,470
questions from the outside maybe in

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:44,370
preparation for this session

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:45,900
no just general you know like you know

00:03:44,370 --> 00:04:02,340
that the session is going on you came

00:03:45,900 --> 00:04:05,910
here I didn't not really we had one in

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,620
our head somehow I have one idea would

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,190
like to resonate just get a sort of like

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:15,150
general deep bang and that's relating to

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,359
the food selection the food that we

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,870
catered to

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,810
and I know this is a contentious issue

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,460
with some people but I would like to see

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,880
I would personally like to see that bump

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,130
had more in the direction of having of

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,039
not defaulting to serving meat every day

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,289
so making vegetarian be more of a

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:39,810
standard default option and then you

00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:44,000
know make meets twice a day or something

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,000
like that so he seems more like

00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:58,789
meet twice for meal time but is there

00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:00,469
anything that I mean we can discuss this

00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:02,479
for two hours now or we can then just

00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:03,919
sort of like generally race kinds and

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,110
just simply say yeah this is something

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,490
we can we could imagine doing and he's

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,529
probably gonna take us a couple of you

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:20,479
to get there there's gonna be my horse

00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:22,659
or if it's well done there will be no

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,659
reason

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:32,870
yeah yeah what I am going or the people

00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,849
that God what we have sometimes like

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,430
which is in my mind there will be some

00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:39,379
cheese bacon cheese but then the other

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,749
people can't eat the egg and cheese but

00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,819
that is only a small portion but if we

00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:46,430
think that in interest more a broader

00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:48,770
public then it should have more vegan

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,259
cheese because I am NOT a strictly vegan

00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,149
but I'd like to eat the big easier so

00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,009
this kind of situation always happens

00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:56,930
and I think it's something if you want

00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:01,550
to try out different things it's the I

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,559
would say it's the best but if you want

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,749
to do that the best way is actually by

00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:07,370
not trying to make it a big discussion

00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:10,899
totally they're just saying this is the

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,899
food as big place so many things

00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:15,050
discussion spend the what I mean the

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,499
worst case if you propose it as a

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,050
fantastical ground yeah oh it's very

00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:21,419
about this

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:26,340
if you just say this is the freedoms

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:30,139
being provided I think once you should

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,139
be that checkbox

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,860
maybe diet food because this year I

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,830
checked the vegan food because I like

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,800
meat but also like bu but it has men at

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:51,659
all year source mmm this checkbox was

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:53,610
completely it would matter because if

00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:56,099
you have one the one day where I have

00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:00,380
meats you need to white socks guys for

00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:03,360
those people community right today with

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,360
digital it anyway you don't need to care

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,460
but will tell you it was a ten year the

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,520
thing I'll say is it for the and if you

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,050
are only having vegetarian stuff on many

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,449
particular day it becomes much more

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,419
important to be to allow the fat lots of

00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:20,659
people I just pinky Tara and so if you

00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:23,250
have something that's a nice healthy

00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:25,050
mixed in each of our Italian meal it may

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,060
be the half people who are the meat

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,659
eaters you only used to eating meat and

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,659
potatoes

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,410
no I don't eat meat

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,960
well yeah we are saying we will do it

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,510
these next year yeah that's big it don't

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,430
say you couldn't really really hard next

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,190
year by the way because Germany's not as

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,480
advanced when it comes to carrying

00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,850
there's some other parts of this world

00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,860
but and I've talked to this to the youth

00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:02,880
hostel already about this in preparation

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,770
but I you know if I if I feel that

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,170
there's a consensus or some sort of like

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,600
backgrounds that I feel that I can

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,220
increase because easier to do in the

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,860
environment of staying in the youth

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,930
hostel place and being in the city that

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,640
confers benefits is not surprising in

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:21,660
the surroundings in a way and people

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,130
have other options I think in some other

00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,240
setups people might have been more

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,240
likely to Jack about it

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,990
yeah they can't they cater to everything

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,169
except for kosher but I'm trying to push

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,900
them to actually be more vegetarian

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,890
oriented anyway we'll talk about this

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,410
more thank you very much for the

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:49,010
feedback then I guess we should get to

00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:49,010
the main point that spawned this meeting

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,110
I just remembering to say which is kind

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,460
of from the some of the previous topic

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:10,500
but it's a general thing really

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:13,240
or not that's it sorry before last is

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:18,460
just about the teams and so on in

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:21,370
general that it is important not not to

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,839
keep her happy but for the lowering the

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,180
stress and mental work needed by the

00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,720
people who are in this regard from

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:31,089
Germany or in this room to actively

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,950
reach out to and pull back in people who

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:34,360
think involved in previous years which

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,950
means people who've been in particular

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,860
teams this year but also maybe in the

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,959
last year or two many years people kind

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,880
of just assumed that as those people's

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,200
responsibility to get involved again if

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,690
they want to do which is obviously true

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,670
but if you just did that attitude at

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,459
leaves that everything needs to be done

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,380
by a limited number of people so even

00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:55,480
though it's annoying to have to reach

00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,600
out to someone and be very polite and

00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,220
say you were you ran the net right team

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,520
two years ago when you're interested in

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,750
doing it anyway

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,890
we can put you in charge of the network

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,350
team because you're so wonderful

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,550
whatever but maybe it feels like it's

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,520
much easier just to get up do it

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,710
yourself by the time it comes to DEFCON

00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,730
4 the months leading up to it is really

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:18,200
a problem if you don't have those people

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:20,090
so maybe in the same well it's partly

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,310
something that someone in particular can

00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,110
take charge of a bit like the

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,870
people job but also it's something

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,480
everyone should think about if you are

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:32,360
involved with a topic just to actively

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,140
be trying to get people from previous

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,000
years because otherwise you pretty young

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,380
again you have a problem with manpower

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,060
but also even if you have a million

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,590
people in Germany again you want to give

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,970
me what next year so the year after or

00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,650
the year after when they're somewhere

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,870
useless that doesn't have enough local

00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:54,170
volunteers there yeah so how do we do

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,270
that it's there's no good easy way I

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,300
think it basically just means whoever's

00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,640
in any again someone could do it if they

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,380
took it as a job to act to kind of re

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,630
recruit previous people and just looking

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,820
through previous year's team lists of

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,850
including me on the wiki or final

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,230
reports but also it needs in some

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,030
respects it needs to come from people

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,230
working in particular areas so say if

00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,000
someone's worked in the networking area

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,640
they should look who's worked on

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,590
networking before us and try and yeah I

00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,450
took keeping those people and again it's

00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,360
it's the problem about the tone because

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,100
you need like for paying people because

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,440
it's not Justin it's not enough to say

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm running networking now do you want

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,000
to come and be my servant because they

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,280
will just say no you need to be a little

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,340
in toad and saying that their can their

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,030
ideas are going to be very important and

00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:46,250
I think the I think we're we are doing

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,990
this here and they are already you know

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,399
maybe

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,160
a little more it's also dependent on

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,330
what time you're in exactly but it's

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,580
something this is relevant to the next

00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,279
few months so we are working with a

00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:01,980
sponsorship team and Norman Garcia and

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,959
Bryan are pretty much on the team again

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,600
and then waited since what when with

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,940
regards to website and stuff I'm working

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,540
very hard this entire week already to a

00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:17,440
good general in case and Steve language

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,570
and petty and to be enticed to keep

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,680
developing what we have says here and

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,560
make it even better but lots of

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,940
management's this time exactly yes and

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:31,270
possibly we'll see about about that and

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,220
then talks team scheduling and so on

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:37,410
that comes much later but in some ways I

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:40,180
feel that is a given anyway in some ways

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,500
it can become an extensive reach out to

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,940
them quite already on the evenings and

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,709
not starting working this all that time

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,690
all right so one of the things that we

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,390
will be discussing in DC 15 over the

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,579
next couple of months is taking in

00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:54,550
feedback from 14 what they did

00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,620
differently and when site comp whoops

00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,670
density of talks we want and so on and

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,200
that's a good thing at this sorry at

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,490
this stage in a way the most important

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,380
thing is just not doing anything that

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,390
goes against that because one or two

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,140
previous years the things happen like

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:13,980
people posting on the wiki there are new

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:17,040
list of teams with members only from the

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,110
Jim and some set of people well not

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,280
really in any rational way but would

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,400
just be annoyed that I can say well I'm

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,260
not going to help them then so we have

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,540
that but you should think that start the

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,240
list like that no it doesn't get paid

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:34,680
yet two courses conflict so no no but

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,390
it's a point I think it come up I think

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,010
this does not have this red mist and

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,480
tell people that into themselves but we

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,800
should attract the people if there's

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,180
actually betterment exactly and then

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,120
suddenly they find themselves in the

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,650
list I mean yeah you kind of if it's a

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,970
wiki thing you can also just add them in

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,350
advance but you said you don't know

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,580
who's really doing it there's not

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:56,370
nothing that need to be there if they're

00:13:50,580 --> 00:14:01,250
not actually change it work there any

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,250
other issues questions ideas

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:11,180
because there's a list with people from

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,660
previous company to yeah that shouldn't

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,420
exist

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,490
yeah well again partly I know reports is

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,149
and popular just other stuff on the wiki

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,410
yeah I think the current Jesus is not

00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:25,779
authoritative and there's one policia

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:29,009
fortunately there's lots of ellipses

00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,009
maybe we should go

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,860
these people actually wear again

00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:39,580
approach the video

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,620
which is like Carl one other person and

00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,970
then my name under volunteers and I know

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,720
that there's more than three people on

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:53,590
video to you for dc1400 juicing is

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:55,950
literally just me yeah well speaking of

00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,180
final reports

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:02,700
you're gonna write it up from 15 one

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,700
this big that got 15 months already done

00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,710
no but I guess you may have followed

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,290
this already you may know about this

00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,570
already but Tiki when and already

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:17,380
created the structure and the empty

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,400
document for the for the BC 14 final

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,470
report and even though that is

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,630
theoretically in the job of the DC 14

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,730
team to finish we all know that this it

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,010
is really good if everyone helps

00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:29,410
especially the next team and it's an our

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,120
main interest to do that and that's I

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,710
would simply like to remind everyone

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,420
that it would be really cool that you

00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,310
could take during this winter it's on

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,050
the way home or at home take half an

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,880
hour time and just jog together stuff

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,380
collect material or even read an article

00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,180
sometimes it's fun some people

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,430
yeah well sleep actually mentioned that

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,680
today and that's I'm not meeting them he

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,950
said while the stress assessment winning

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,660
nominee perched the BC 14

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,110
stop thinking about the final report

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,730
also coming up with ideas I mean that's

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,590
great but in the end it needs some money

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,930
who were at the chapter so I don't know

00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,460
maybe we could talk to them and say well

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,090
a little differently this year what

00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:11,150
possibly as it was that people computer

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,470
chapters and then I'm offended by other

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,380
people

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:18,140
the final report

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,640
and if you just if people start okay

00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,740
looking at what clothes and stuff that's

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,440
useful but I think the real work is

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,960
writing chapters I think it's a very

00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,050
good thing

00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,990
with this primary and secondary chapter

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,440
so if

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:35,260
team fails to come up with something at

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,030
some point you will just ship it will

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:41,670
that's a good thing but there is

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:45,660
yes I will I will personally see through

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:47,100
the budget and accounting chapter which

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,720
seems to be one of the core chapter

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,240
sentiments and somebody else

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,700
I'm is willing to do that and I have

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,700
some dream that at the end of the

00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,710
conference we the organizing team meets

00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,860
with the next organizing team for at

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:04,350
night and then doing the final report is

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,120
part of that day and also like learning

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,189
from each other and discussing what's

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,600
what's good in what one and it would be

00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:12,390
really useful to have a disk on fence

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,640
because the experimentation that we're

00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,920
doing I don't know what's going to

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,959
happen this year but I think we would

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,439
like to plan it actually planet and

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,970
announce it for DC 15 so that everybody

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,470
knows already for the time they booked

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,569
flights that they're sort of like

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,390
invited to stay a bit longer

00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,790
um which of course can be combined with

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:37,560
pairs like dinner I mean that's all

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:40,470
doable right so anyway bottom line final

00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,390
report if you feel like you have half an

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:46,370
hour or an hour or on the way home you

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:50,070
would like to write something talk to de

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:53,700
right okay anyone can wait before you go

00:17:50,070 --> 00:18:03,090
home exactly and I hope we can make this

00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:11,270
happen you can claim with us the wiki if

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:11,270
you know you're good other things

00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:19,139
the elephant in the room well there's

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:21,419
there's also the top do we need to talk

00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,190
about that or is that under control you

00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:26,970
wouldn t have been working great right

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:29,759
then well we should discuss who's going

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,700
to actually go well we don't know we can

00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,309
discuss later let's let's discuss like I

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,049
mean then I think everybody who wants

00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,029
who can be they are both be there

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,320
because that's that's one of the times

00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:41,549
when you actually get to show your face

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,879
and take credit for the work that you've

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:43,879
already done

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:50,279
well yes but we've already done a lot of

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,489
work and we get to present that now and

00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:56,340
so that's a motivation but yeah it's

00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:59,759
also a it's also a promise with the

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,220
future all right then

00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,580
let's talk briefly about the sponsorship

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,580
for sure

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,590
so the process what happens it was a

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,530
little bit up and down yeah they're

00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,570
everywhere and I did have a bad day in

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:22,680
the middle of it too and pushed things

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:25,480
that made some people angry I think that

00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,820
we've talked between those people and

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,680
myself and up to the to the point where

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:34,180
all the bad feelings have been taken

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,340
under control and I also don't think

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,530
that any steps have been taken which are

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,610
irreversible because they are in any way

00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:45,330
public the process that we're at at the

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:48,160
moment is that we are now pretty much

00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,810
somewhere in the middle between DC team

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,680
looking at the sponsorship for sure and

00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:57,130
DC 15 team making a final decision

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,780
we had the sponsorship for sure more or

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,690
less done and we pushed it out to the

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:06,550
sponsors team and there were many

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:10,380
discussions on the IRC Channel not many

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:13,350
people had a lot of time but Brian

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,730
provided very insightful feedback

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,770
Norman Casilla provided very insightful

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,530
full feedback and there was a statement

00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:23,640
from Norman

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:25,980
I'm saying that as far as in salad this

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,010
brochure is ready to be presented to DC

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,110
team which I took to mean I don't even

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:34,230
know what this was a scene is exactly

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,580
made up of but Norman is certainly one

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,150
of the people who has been doing a lot

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:41,460
of work so I trust that he's he gave me

00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:45,570
to go ahead in this one and I sent the

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:48,630
brochure to DC team last week about a

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,370
week ago and with a request for comments

00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,390
and also but secondly notice that all of

00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,390
the different points that were

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:56,520
questionable and so far I have not seen

00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,380
any feedback which obviously can also be

00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,370
a way to play and that means consensus

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:04,650
right which is obviously attributable to

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:08,420
to travel long events it's happening and

00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:11,550
something that's something we wanted to

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:15,150
not wait very much longer with this

00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,650
brochure because of DC 14 there was a

00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,990
sort of like self-imposed deadline that

00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,760
maybe we could hand out or have them

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,070
already like display the sponsorship for

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,590
sure to some people at DC 14 but also

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:29,879
frost comp which I thought would happen

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,249
not so good yeah it happened last

00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:33,720
weekend um so there was a little bit of

00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,580
a problem there

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,059
hi Bert I still think that we should

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:41,599
keep up the pace now and and get this

00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:44,549
finished as soon as possible because the

00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:47,009
budgeting season starts for the big

00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:49,049
companies and if we want to be in the

00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:51,659
budget that's gonna be finalized in

00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:53,340
October November and then we really need

00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:56,009
to get a move on we've already had the

00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:59,220
first request from a from a potential

00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:00,989
platinum sponsor for the sponsorship for

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:07,679
sure saying that they closed their

00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:09,450
budgeting at the in the past so it's in

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,099
the party well then they closed that

00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,679
planning for whatever it was a special

00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:15,210
thing but yes anyway yes I don't know

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,799
when effect is the same thing there's

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,099
that there's also bidding on the regret

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:23,279
involved so as we are we're in a very

00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:24,539
good position here but this is important

00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,710
information to know and I think we

00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,419
should not mean in younger and I don't

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,899
think there's much of a reason to wait

00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:32,669
much longer if the terms that we

00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:33,989
promised in the sponsorship brochure at

00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,450
this point in time there's something

00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:38,669
that we can reach agreement on the

00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,179
specific point about that sponsor I

00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:43,979
would say it's not vital status to

00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,629
resolve all there are many questions

00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:47,099
before that because you could also send

00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:49,409
them a version of the brochure that

00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:51,030
removes the potentially contentious

00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:55,080
points yeah and just

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:56,760
now today yeah that's true so my and I

00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,640
had already talked about this that be

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,530
most of the contention things well I

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,090
don't quite know I can say I know had

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,470
time to look at recent version I'll

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,020
attend the original and the discussions

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,730
like not had time to so most of the most

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,980
contentious stuff has been removed there

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,920
still some stuff in there do wanna cook

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,490
a resume but in the room the individual

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,230
points but we already talked about that

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:23,190
we could actually have iterations one

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:26,040
right now and then we can make two forms

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:28,470
of changes we can add very second selves

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,720
in nature although that is a little bit

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,190
of a problem because maybe the first

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,750
sponsor wanted to do the company

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,310
bouncers can always ask you something

00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,290
personalized it's on the brush anyway so

00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:39,270
it's not that's true that's true today

00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,190
we've never done this before though they

00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,170
we have done special things with just

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,570
one system right but we do know I've got

00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,210
some type of Russians but right and we

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,440
can also if we modify the brochure maybe

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,150
slightly the wording we could

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,830
potentially actually increase the levels

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:57,330
nature completely without ever deeply

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:59,580
stop so yes we can we can take whatever

00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,980
we have and have potentially a minimal

00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,980
minimal version and push that out but I

00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,020
don't think we're very far from I'm

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,580
having something that at least the

00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,090
people that have been working on it to

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,100
come

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:14,610
with and hopefully other people can be

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,010
persuaded on I will quickly summarize

00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:21,480
what the contents of the for Sheerness

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:25,050
it is based on the BC thirteen brochure

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,420
and we did change a little bit the

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,310
contents of the text or rephrased it a

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,900
little bit but also I think freshens it

00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:34,260
up a little you know the sponsor see

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,820
that really here again and we did remove

00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,200
for instance Debian day because we would

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,790
like to have an open weekend on the

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,460
first weekend at the entire weekend open

00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:45,270
but that's surely to be discussed how

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:47,880
exactly we do that um we are going to

00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:50,160
offer supporter Bronze Silver Gold and

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,470
Platinum the standard levels and there's

00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,130
been a little bit of a back and forth on

00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:59,370
how expensive they should actually be

00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:01,830
not as a blame our last proposal is that

00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:06,030
we should have the bronze letters start

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:09,690
at 2500 which is step up your own yeah

00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:13,560
which is a step up a step up from BC

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:15,810
thirteen then have the silver pepper a

00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,660
silhouette will be 5,000 10,000 to

00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:23,340
20,000 basically very nicely times two

00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:26,250
numbers which altogether is more or less

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,380
the same as DC 13 so basically we pushed

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:31,980
up France and the reason by in the end I

00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,240
wanted to raise them more because I

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,180
think there's potential for that but

00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,030
with the perks that we offer I think

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,190
that maybe it's going to pan out

00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,260
anyway so what are some of these perks

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:45,050
that we offer and what other contentious

00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:50,270
ones tonight give me the URL InDesign

00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:52,460
you can do okay so they're there two

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:55,390
classes perks that we would like to

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:58,270
think about consider that one of them is

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,980
three classes actually one of them is

00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,780
events and aspects of the conference

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,920
that we offer anyway and would like to

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:10,460
give a sponsor the possibility to adopt

00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:12,650
the second class is events or perks that

00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,030
are not necessary but we would like to

00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,430
give the sponsor the opportunity to do

00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:20,510
to give for instance provide coffee to

00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:24,430
all of the people your coffee and then

00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:27,260
there's also the idea of having booths

00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:30,020
for sponsors especially when we have a

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,900
opening weekend allowing sponsors to

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,960
present themselves and also have

00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,260
something that we refer to as a job fair

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,400
which is basically removed from all the

00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,930
where all the people are a little bit

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,490
further back into a room allowing

00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,030
sponsors to actually engage in direct

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,650
conversation with potential candidates

00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:50,900
that they would like to hire in

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:53,120
combination also with a with a job board

00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,310
so that the questions are a little bit

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,640
can we imagine having sponsor who do we

00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:05,140
think that a jump here is an idea that

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,140
could take off and then the

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,550
and then the additional sponsoring

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:14,600
opportunities which at the moment are

00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:17,090
that we would like to offer the

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,390
conference dinner which is certainly the

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:23,210
biggest expense and then in this sense

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,770
that we would like to ask her it doesn't

00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,590
necessarily mean it's nice of you

00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,510
individually if I did to my anyway know

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:34,670
room and board obviously but but even

00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:36,770
nature could be more sure the de turpan

00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:38,420
conference in Iran at first to anyway

00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,830
and there's a little bit of a

00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,540
description like marketing type

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,310
description of why this would be a cool

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,320
thing to contribute differently so on

00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,870
next and beverages makes it play the

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,650
subsidy of the of the bar which I think

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:54,170
we're gonna have to do it 15 and she's

00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,930
in white party um the venue has agreed

00:27:54,170 --> 00:28:01,700
finally to let us do that on site but

00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:04,880
they gonna charge us 250 per person just

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:08,540
two euros 50 on your restaurants here in

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,340
Paris it's not much money not much money

00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:14,540
but and we get glass we get wine glasses

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:16,040
we get a blurry they clean up it's not

00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,110
too bad we would like to save that money

00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:26,109
obviously by cleaning up ourselves and

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:28,580
so on but yeah

00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:30,139
yeah but we get it we get that the

00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:40,970
sponsor to pay for that it's true you

00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:42,499
didn't well yeah - there's also there's

00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,159
also a lot of results that's pretty

00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:45,499
special

00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,229
there's also coffee which I've mentioned

00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:49,700
already and then there are two new ideas

00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:51,710
that I don't think we've considered in

00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,919
the past but that calling one of them is

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,389
that we have lecture and meeting rooms

00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:00,259
right for instance right now we're

00:28:56,389 --> 00:29:03,169
sitting in room 329 I think this is a

00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:10,399
highly contentious issue I think that if

00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:12,049
this room were called the Intel room and

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:16,519
that's fungal room and that's it and so

00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:20,539
on and so forth and gave us $2,000 to do

00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:20,809
that I like that thing you know it's not

00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:23,840
enough

00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:26,029
absolutely correct um but just for the

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,479
sake of argument let's pick a number and

00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:31,369
then that would certainly you know drop

00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:33,349
some people badly we think that this

00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:37,369
over commercialize is the content of the

00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:40,580
controversy so it's not that all of that

00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:44,739
is absolutely true but it does give us

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:47,929
money and it is not really changing the

00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:49,999
field that sort of like the conference

00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:52,309
content you know anyway that's one of

00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:54,349
the ideas there's the same lady of a

00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:56,000
deaf camp or that compact base that

00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:58,460
individual

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,490
these days and then they're the final

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,690
point is something that I've seen in a

00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,960
couple of conferences which I like very

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:10,040
much is buttery prices to be given out

00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,870
and this often combined with sort of

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,000
like the homeroom assemblies in the

00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,860
morning prior to the first talk whenever

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,440
that may be

00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,360
you've just assemble all together for 20

00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,260
minutes and that is a time for the

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,760
organizers to spread important

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:28,460
announcements for instance about today

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,830
and she's mine party today and in order

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,920
to entice people to come to these events

00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:38,750
and a price is given out to you know

00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,420
yeah and would go like this it would be

00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:43,550
like yeah iago one this price and then

00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,110
Jagger wouldn't stand up right and the

00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:51,110
chair wouldn't like that very much when

00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:51,650
you later found out oh hi um and then it

00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,150
was just gone

00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,010
and until somebody in the room took it

00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,830
and that's been tablets and laptops and

00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:59,630
everything this is just an idea out

00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,160
there whether we want this homeroom

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:07,840
assembly and whether we could benefit

00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:12,820
from it so question coming

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,820
well my my commenters

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,309
I mean I'm very worried about this

00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:19,629
insensate now let's see it also net for

00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,519
example you have these busy schedule

00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:23,349
thing and I see sitting next session of

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,489
blah blah blah and then it says next

00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:27,269
session in the into a room and it's

00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:27,269
really nice

00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:37,510
in general if we put it somewhere in the

00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,510
in the corner that

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:48,059
so I think anything which people really

00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:51,769
have to interact with is highly

00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:54,299
contentious that's why we also consider

00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:57,400
having these booths or the job fair

00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:59,200
really only on the open weekend and

00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,420
well the place witnesses and people who

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,160
don't like it don't actually have to go

00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:09,790
there maybe this is already too much and

00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:11,500
but then generally thinking that once

00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:16,970
it's so visible to everybody

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:18,860
it really can let people not come

00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,630
we already talked with somebody who said

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,050
probably somebody didn't come because

00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,050
there's

00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:32,420
very sensitive to say okay this is my

00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:37,320
brand let me run it

00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:39,030
yeah I said well they is also as I'm

00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,360
provider like this possible give us

00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:45,510
money but we aren't that that when when

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:50,190
the Avro has a name of a sponsor it is

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:52,140
it's part of their identity I think it's

00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,380
too much I think if there's no price

00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:59,370
it's not that it's not enough for me it

00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,440
has no price because that cone is not in

00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:04,260
there or goober or HP I know they are

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,530
providing the resources but it's

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:09,680
something I wouldn't put our I wouldn't

00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,680
offer

00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:22,740
it's it's that computer something that

00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:26,480
is different from other taking the rooms

00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:35,850
have to change I mean then you could

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:38,190
yeah maybe I see is there just then are

00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,650
there arguments from people in here for

00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:43,680
this like that we could make it happen I

00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,940
mean I think considering what's been

00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,500
said and also considering what he just

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,880
said is kind of I was thinking or maybe

00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,560
was you I'm sorry I think that there is

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,040
kind of a middle ground at three factors

00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,500
I'm going to definitely agree that like

00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:01,740
the identity of Debian and like Kampf

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,630
and like like how we're different than

00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,130
other two inches or whatever it was

00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,620
worth will work for while thing to

00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:10,800
consider but I also think that you know

00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,200
this sponsorship is nice the long-term

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,970
growth of our conference as well as much

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,770
as we just like the possibility of

00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,620
becoming intertwined with you know

00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:21,149
capitalistic groups it's something worth

00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:25,350
considering that for long term growth

00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:26,310
but I think having you know the name you

00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,010
misspelled race today

00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:31,919
I know the Fryeburg room you know

00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:34,370
sponsored by Intel and in the IRC it

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:38,280
says coming up in ten minutes in the

00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:40,110
Freiburg room is blah blah blah and it

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,010
just says sponsored by Intel someone in

00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,419
the room I feel like that's something

00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,820
that you sponsor would be willing to pay

00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:47,159
for and also doesn't you know shove it

00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,870
in your face like because it already

00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,370
says literally says until right there if

00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,380
it just have the words in black text

00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:54,810
sponsored for differing sponsored by

00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,360
above it all right well how do you do it

00:34:54,810 --> 00:35:01,170
the platinum sponsor that we promised to

00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:03,930
put in all the banners and then my door

00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:08,640
LT company decisis just have a different

00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:10,800
silencing I was just saying is e so if

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,780
the ball should not mention their

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,550
sponsor they were quite worried on the

00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,680
amicus's at this much is much higher

00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,020
level on the parks in general that we

00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,310
have we have actually tried all these or

00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,050
not all these specific ones we have

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,400
tried most of these similar things to

00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,920
most occurs in the past not the rooms

00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,270
but trying to get people to sponsor

00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,820
particular rents and so on there's two

00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,230
things one is that there most of the

00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,300
time the sponsors would not have not

00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,610
really responded that much on them so

00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,950
there's a den and the other aspect

00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:41,250
though is that people have had problems

00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:43,650
in designing a way to make it work it

00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,330
doesn't make it much easier to get a

00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,880
high profile we're paying a small amount

00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,560
of money for a particular event than by

00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,470
giving us money we can actually spend on

00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,850
the core things being safe I mean so for

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,310
example the cheese and wine things say

00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,770
if you want something to allow them to

00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:59,790
sponsor that you basically need to make

00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,400
it they're not just paying for the

00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,470
cheese and white but they actually pay

00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:07,710
twenty times the price or something so

00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:10,230
that you get enough money to actually

00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,050
cover the core or cost of combination of

00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,270
food and side

00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,740
the danger then is that that's not an

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,540
interesting opportunity to battle to

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,490
know price pricing is going to be

00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:21,160
ringing like so much the question is at

00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:23,080
the moment we actually have had we have

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,930
problems are ready to negotiate sensibly

00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,630
with the sponsors and to get those

00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:30,430
conversations to happen I don't really

00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:34,180
see that we have at the moment the

00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:38,140
manpower and experienced sales people to

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:39,760
push some push sponsors to do these

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,980
things in addition to their current

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,230
levels I think in principle if you had

00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,240
expert sales people you can do that you

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,860
get them to sign up to some level and on

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,810
top you say why do you also sponsor this

00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:52,540
and keep one funding them up every week

00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:55,540
until they agree that's what you need to

00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,060
do I mean we had in the past some when

00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,230
we had a much smaller team we had

00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,720
Andreas actually did some of this and he

00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,360
was literally burning people up every

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,970
day until they said yes yes I'll sponsor

00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,650
you why couldn't you but most people is

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,900
that be under knock yeah I was not

00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:13,420
they're not really willing to to behave

00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,980
that way and we don't have at the moment

00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,200
we have a shortage of people to do it so

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,630
at the promise of a moment we we do get

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,980
enough money by doing the kind of simple

00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:24,070
thing so we just make a simple decision

00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:26,980
for them what level are you taking we

00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,480
get master back and we eventually write

00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:31,180
an invoice and we eventually realize

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,090
we've got the money and so on if we make

00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,920
this much more complicated firstly

00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:38,050
designing it actually should really need

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,670
someone with more experience than most

00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:44,830
of us have on this kind of stuff you

00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:48,310
mean the prices yeah to actually get it

00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:51,160
right and then secondly it needs a

00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,880
genuine sales effort and discussions

00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,700
they're not just sending a brochure

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,020
waiting for them to respondent I

00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:02,000
completely agree with both of these

00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:03,620
points the design as I envision it at

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,170
the moment is that there is always a

00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:09,440
fallback if we don't sell any of these

00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:11,270
perks because the sponsors chose to stay

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,980
with a simple level they know from the

00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:15,700
last year which don't change very much

00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:17,720
then as long as we get enough money

00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,920
we're just gonna pick them or so the

00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:24,110
dangers the other way around that the

00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:26,200
money just comes through of it because

00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:31,000
the the perks are only available to

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:33,560
sponsors and levels yeah that's kind of

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,290
okay it depends how you design it we

00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,210
have had we have tried to design perform

00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,310
we has that we have tried to sell these

00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,050
products with limited access and so on

00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,550
we have had particular events once my

00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,410
sponsors before it that is a so the

00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:47,120
general principle is not something is

00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:50,120
something the team has already accepted

00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,960
to have a particular party sponsored by

00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,430
someone or never

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,170
that eventually something we have done

00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,400
before it's not a it shouldn't be

00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:58,370
contentious because it's already

00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,960
existing practice I'm questioning the

00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,850
reality the question is here if you're

00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:06,200
trying to push this as a big aspect

00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:09,190
which it sounded like then it's just a

00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,210
bit dangerous into relation to our

00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,620
availability of manpower and our

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,230
experience actually getting it right I

00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,520
just have a worry that we will make some

00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,740
we wouldn't quite realize the

00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,910
implications correctly until we realize

00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,110
we've only got half money because

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,450
actually although they all pay for a

00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,609
park they went in at one

00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:27,970
hello time to pay for a box yeah but

00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:29,650
there it was paid for it depends yeah

00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:33,369
but the main cost of food accommodation

00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:35,650
and travel okay right much much greater

00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:37,960
than the powering Simsek weird we're

00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:41,560
talking about a gold sponsor at 10000

00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:45,010
who decides to go 5000 silver plus

00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,990
conference dinner then we get five

00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,160
thousand plus the entire organisation of

00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,300
the conference dinners that we don't

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,560
actually have to worry about the

00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:54,339
conference dinner we can take that out

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,010
of the budget AC again I don't

00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:59,260
in principle disagree with something

00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:01,540
these I just think it's it needs a lot

00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,160
of time and thought to exactly get to

00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,140
get those right and to be considering

00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,550
what again basically one of these

00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,980
thought experiments needs to be done is

00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:13,920
what if every sponsor goes one level

00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,920
below and pays for a small park on top

00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:27,400
you know sponsors paid for he wins we

00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:29,290
how much 20 times sister said well no

00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,910
well previously we have not done that

00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:32,680
properly I mean I have not done it

00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:37,210
correctly in fact for this stuff in all

00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:38,410
four there's a lot of but most of the

00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,270
specific stuff at the moment we've

00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:41,920
basically just let them pay their price

00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:44,880
which doesn't make sense though we've

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,880
thought about like twice

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,160
as one thought yeah but it's a real cost

00:40:52,089 --> 00:41:03,460
of the cheese in white likely the

00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:05,499
exposure cost is many thousands yeah all

00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,200
right yeah I'd say maybe five or

00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:09,999
whatever yeah kinda depends how the

00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,289
exposure is it's very difficult question

00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:11,799
you can there's a fundraising walk

00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:14,799
Friday

00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:23,950
I said two times because it's son to 15

00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:28,900
to 2 euros 50 times under people yeah it

00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:33,660
was anyway I would like to we we have I

00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:36,460
am Connie who has experience and

00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,900
sponsorship yeah when I say experiencing

00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,480
that I really mean someone who's worked

00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,890
commercially in the area I think I don't

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,920
notice it I usually the marketing

00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:46,869
personally she does fundraising and

00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,440
we've talked about this and I think the

00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:54,009
important consideration is that if we

00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,019
come up with a system by which we

00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:59,019
minimize the risk that we're gonna get

00:41:56,019 --> 00:42:01,059
less money than we would have to and if

00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:02,410
we ensure that the core conference with

00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:04,180
all the things that we expect from it

00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:07,089
including conference than a day trip and

00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:12,039
cheese and wine parties in subsidized

00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:14,450
bar and and so on and so forth if we can

00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:18,470
come up with that then

00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:22,010
I firmly believe we should try the call

00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:24,920
you know by that's a thought experiment

00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:29,049
and I think that if we if we are smart

00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:33,799
about it we can put this in place and

00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:35,329
possibly make mistakes for DC 15 as long

00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:37,910
as they are not going to strengthen the

00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:40,549
core conference what is I'm a driver as

00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:42,280
well because as long as we get enough

00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:46,910
money to pay for that comment

00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:51,349
the the aim is to be able to find more

00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:53,420
people to Def Con to offer more at Def

00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:55,960
Con well this year we have a surplus of

00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,609
quite a few thousands that's because our

00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:01,720
adversary's team started work seven

00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:04,880
weeks before the conference yes if we

00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,500
raise the same amount of money except we

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,540
actually start out as we get a bit more

00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,750
yeah and we run bursaries and other

00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:20,920
things better yeah we already have

00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:20,920
enough to find more people no

00:43:22,839 --> 00:44:01,130
so huge perfect I'm not sure I I see

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,569
your point and I think that but I'm

00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:05,930
probably sure that everyone in this room

00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:08,960
agrees that there comes a point at which

00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:10,760
you sold out too much right and that is

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,200
important credibly difficult to find and

00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,910
everybody will disagree on where exactly

00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,859
that pointless but I think we all agree

00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,539
that there comes a point or there is a

00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:20,720
point at some point in time where the

00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:23,180
conference has sold its soul right and I

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,240
think that we where I personally think

00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:28,279
we're not at that point and not close to

00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,170
that point I think there's potential of

00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:32,569
going a little bit more giving a little

00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,579
bit more exposure to people in certain

00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:38,450
ways and in return getting more money

00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:39,980
and that money how we use it whether we

00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,690
use it for additional travel whether we

00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,539
use it for additional offerings at the

00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:47,119
conference whether we put it into a fund

00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:50,299
such that we already have all the money

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,539
for DC 16 right now and when I'm doing

00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:55,569
the sponsorship work for DC 17 drinks

00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:58,029
16 these are all possibilities endless I

00:44:55,569 --> 00:45:00,809
feel McCann been worried about as long

00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,809
