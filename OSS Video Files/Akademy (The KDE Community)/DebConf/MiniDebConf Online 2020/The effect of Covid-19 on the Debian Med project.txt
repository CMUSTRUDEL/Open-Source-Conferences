	00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:12,850
hello my name is Andrea Stella I have

00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,879
frequently spoken on several deaf cons

00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:18,130
but the DEF CON online gives me the

00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:21,310
chance to realize a dream to speak from

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:26,580
outside outside from my balcony outside

00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:30,460
from home and I like this a lot because

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,230
when I was not able to attend debconf

00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,449
and I had to watch the stream at home I

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,800
was sitting here and so it's nice to

00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:42,659
have the DEF CON fear from this place Oh

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,999
what about the topic the topic is about

00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:53,460
covet 19 effort on the DVR maid project

00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:55,839
and in in short I can say it has a

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,960
positive effect what I was told that

00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:02,679
this doesn't sound so nice so I will

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,809
explain a little bit better since every

00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:08,860
crisis has its effects whereas some

00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:11,530
people or organization have a positive

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,140
effect on from every crisis so it's

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,170
quite obvious that people who are

00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:22,149
producing the respirator mask or working

00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:24,850
on biology and so have some some

00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:29,859
positive effects because work is needed

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:33,520
and since they were made is also working

00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:38,770
in this field of bioinformatics in

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:44,079
epidemiology we have new challenges due

00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:46,810
to this crisis and the project gained a

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:52,090
real huge awareness way more than before

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:54,549
and so we joined the global free

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:58,020
software sprint in bioinformatics this

00:01:54,549 --> 00:02:01,780
print was organized by not only

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,710
distributors but also up same developers

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:08,560
of free software this fear and so we

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,489
just tried it

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,690
well to continue my person introduction

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:19,890
I am just working in Medical Institute

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:23,349
in a group of epidemiologists and so my

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:28,860
paid work bumped a lot you were to this

00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:28,860
crisis and I had a lot of work to do

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,310
you

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,879
you

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:43,970
no I'm still have lost ponent

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,689
yeah I guess there's some down starts to

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,689
working outside

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,459

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:37,180
said Deema I had thought and was really

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,839
really helpful to get all software

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:44,260
accepted so we have set up a wiki page

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,240
where all this software was listed which

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:52,029
we introduced in nuan which is relevant

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:55,570
for kovat 19 and it it was amazing for

00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:58,020
me to see that in less than 24 hours a

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,180
lot of effect packages got accepted

00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:05,440
usually we have the situation desk that

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:08,020
we are able to push more packages to new

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,750
to the new cool than FTP master's able

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:14,560
to process but they wiped out all the

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:17,950
lists of packages we be uploaded and it

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,440
was really really helpful and it goes a

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:23,100
big Saint goes to all members of to the

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,890
FTP team who helped us a lot

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,300
hi Andrea yes sorry to interrupt you and

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,030
do you know that you disappeared for a

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,250
few minutes like for a significant part

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,900
of your talk wait a minute I can can you

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,700
please repeat

00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:42,220
you disappeared for quite a bit during

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,690
your talk like oh 10 minutes yeah it

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,670
seems like it disappeared we try to get

00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,270
hold of you we couldn't it seems like

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,740
your phone was off as well sorry about

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,690
that but it seems like it was something

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,200
on your side someone so if Wi-Fi you oh

00:16:52,690 --> 00:17:01,170
yeah okay should I should I switch back

00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,170
to it can you give me a keyboard where I

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,500
and I can't remember let's see if we can

00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:11,869
get someone from our sea to remind us so

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,449
you were talking about how

00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:19,519
different parts or different people are

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:22,279
important to the covert 19 effort okay

00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:25,069
so I will I will continue there or I

00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:28,549
will switch back to the how much time

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:33,669
you have to do we have okay I will I was

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:38,359
thinking so we have new contributors to

00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:41,929
to our project and it was quite

00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:46,339
challenging to to distribute all the

00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:51,589
tasks we have and the nice thing was

00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:56,109
that well for me not so nice but I had

00:17:51,589 --> 00:18:00,739
to to change my own work plan because

00:17:56,109 --> 00:18:06,499
it's a time to distribute all this work

00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:10,609
amongst the newcomers was really really

00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:15,259
much but I am in my mentoring of the

00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:18,619
month project I established a habit to

00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:22,940
give preference to newcomers all the

00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:27,049
time because even if I would do some

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:30,259
tasks faster than they in in the end if

00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:34,429
I teach people and they come to us it

00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:38,809
would be very more we could do more work

00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:41,179
in in in the topic and this my my habit

00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:43,999
to to give preference to the newcomers

00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:48,349
and and answer their questions quickly

00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:51,139
was very well received and so we we was

00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:58,700
able to get a lot of people involved

00:18:51,139 --> 00:19:01,820
successfully so I really want to say

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:06,229
thanks a lot to the big supporter of FTP

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:09,889
masters because we had we had some Vika

00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:14,899
page where we put all packages we

00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:17,119
uploaded to a new cue and the FTP master

00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:20,570
picked from there with high preference

00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,419
and they were so far as to process our

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,930
packages either by accepting them or

00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,480
rejecting them too

00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:31,440
- this with some issues that we are not

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,420
able to fill the FTP queue as usually

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,910
with with our packages but they wiped

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:40,560
out everything and the big things goes

00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:43,380
to all the FTP masters and we we are

00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:48,590
really happy about the support which

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:51,960
which was so great in this print we also

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:57,330
worked about lighting licensing issues

00:19:51,960 --> 00:20:00,090
because my idea was to say well we have

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:04,170
some up streams who have very

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:09,090
interesting programs that have no free

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:12,630
licenses which cannot be distributed in

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:16,680
Debian main or sometimes not even at all

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:21,020
in Debian and this crisis might be a

00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:24,180
good point in time to ask them to

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:27,660
consider as a license and actually we

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,090
are very successful in some cases and we

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:35,220
had some fruitful discussions something

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:38,640
are some software's pending for free

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:42,900
licensing but it's promising so yeah

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:48,480
also on this field it was a good effect

00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:51,810
for Debian made to tackle the issues in

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,720
this crisis regarding a new

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:59,690
communications channels well usually and

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:02,970
Debian made we communicate in about

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:07,320
estimating lists which is our main

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:10,110
communication channel we well IRC is not

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:14,280
really new but it's not really so much

00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:16,530
used in our projects this is also due to

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,500
my personal habit but I somehow switched

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:22,620
into debconf modes where I'm reading IRC

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:28,740
and so we have kind of communication on

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:30,630
ILC we also have kind of well I wouldn't

00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,160
say we have established a telegram

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,990
channels they have also telegram channel

00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,200
which I use between some outreach

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,430
students and some people they invited

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,990
there who also has

00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:44,730
they are I do not really like this

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,130
discussion on telegram because it's not

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:53,610
archived it's somehow hidden but

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:57,270
sometimes it was quick to to do some

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,980
communication there and this is an

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,230
additional means of communication and

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,620
what we also established was a daily

00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:07,290
daily treaty conference it was very

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,990
interesting because we had some kind of

00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:14,430
five to six people who showed up every

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:17,070
day and this image with the background

00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:21,330
is the same they have seen for me every

00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:23,490
day but there were also some people who

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,500
showed up on one day and the next day at

00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,370
somebody else and so always new people

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,500
came in and they're interested and

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:35,010
somehow stay connected to our projects

00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:38,070
which is really nice so also this video

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:41,850
conferencing is well you will thing to

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:45,630
do and we continue with this once a week

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:48,600
so every Friday we are doing video

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,560
conference about topics in the Debian

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:59,190
mid project connected to the cup with 19

00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:04,350
effort yeah well my actually my task was

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:08,340
on my what I intend to do in this week

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:12,870
of the commad 19 debian mid sprint to

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:17,280
develop kind of a new QA tool we have

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:21,720
for sure we have tracker data beyond dog

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:27,690
which is listing the QA features like

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:32,430
testing migrations and DEP CI and so but

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:35,610
we want to have it on one page for each

00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:38,070
task so we can people direct to the

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:41,520
biology Charles epidemiology task all

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:45,840
our newly-created scored 19 tasks so

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,600
people have on one image all the QA

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,230
issues

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:55,990
to deal with this and not need to pick a

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:59,330
single product single packages so I

00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:02,410
didn't finish this but I at least had

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:06,140
have a u DD query which is basically

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:08,890
returning all the data which is which

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:13,280
are needed for this and I started with a

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:15,860
kind of webpage which needs more data

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,520
and needs a better layout and so but

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:23,630
this can be done later I dedicated it

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:28,130
sprint week for this because normal days

00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:30,020
are usually but fixing packaging and so

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,140
and they wanted to do something else

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:38,840
instead of catered weekend well finally

00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:43,400
we want to do another springe in mid of

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:48,320
June one another dedicated week and I

00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:52,730
hope we can get kind of this engagement

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:56,560
of people as well to get all the people

00:24:52,730 --> 00:25:00,380
again the since despite we'd never

00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:04,100
finish this official sprint we are more

00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:09,610
or less in somehow past print mode with

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:15,880
a lot of effort done on covered 19 tasks

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:19,790
there we can't gave or gave us way more

00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:23,120
contribution of point since FTP Mars is

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:26,840
not as active anymore as it was in this

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:30,440
week and so we want to get back this

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,360
situation one more to get sort of more

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:37,990
things and then I will also concentrate

00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:43,880
on such tasks which I usually don't do

00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:46,550
so for the last points c2 deuce is yeah

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,280
we maybe we want to do some kind of

00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,620
quantification of the circuit success in

00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,680
team matrix which could be a nice topic

00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:58,370
for another talk where I could prepare

00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:00,730
some slides and more numbers then just

00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:04,930
chatting about the things

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:08,890
I want to finalize cqa - we want to do

00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:13,290
more packaging maybe filling all the

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:18,670
remaining gaps in the list for the

00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:21,180
Naropa workflows and we also try to keep

00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:24,850
nagging up streams for free licenses

00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:27,790
yeah and maybe you will see an

00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,900
announcement so soon about another

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:33,660
sprint week

00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:40,810
most probably from June 15 to 2 and 22

00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:42,940
this is at Lisa R or plan we have yeah

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:50,170
well this is so far what I wanted to

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:53,110
tell you and I don't know I have maybe

00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:55,960
some more minutes left maybe I repeat

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:59,890
one of the paragraphs I intended to

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,960
speak because I was interrupted but if

00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,890
there are any questions from the

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:08,350
audience

00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:18,610
I can also these first and yeah maybe I

00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:23,350
get some response just got the question

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:26,080
what's the Casa Linda this is Casa of

00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,100
running order running order is my

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,470
hometown

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,720
I wasn't born here about this is to my

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,930
I'm living here since 30 years and I

00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,320
like it a lot and if if you want to come

00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:42,310
here I could yeah I you are kindly

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,140
invited but as I said it's a little bit

00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:47,040
disconnected from the the nearest

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:52,450
airport is 2.5 hours

00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:59,620
power train so yeah you need to like to

00:27:52,450 --> 00:28:02,320
travel a bit any other questions should

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:04,030
I walk around with the camera and show a

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,750
little bit more of the food in the

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,750
garden and so

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:37,250
oh actually not so see he was so I see

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:42,169
here the interruption was it's 15

00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:46,370
minutes but I hope I repeat it

00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:52,419
well actually I I reposed on I'll see

00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:52,419
the the link which I was talking about

00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:59,990
so angry I'm butting in with a question

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:02,809
and that I didn't ask an RFC but I was

00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:05,360
wondering what happened with tensorflow

00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:09,710
I know that the Debian mid team also did

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,850
some work to try to get that into to

00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:15,309
Debian faster have they made any

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:22,580
progress with that well we had tens of

00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:28,789
41.0 in Debian but it was in

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:30,970
experimental I think and we had tens of

00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:35,210
point tensorflow

00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:38,690
2.0 in new queue and he was rejected for

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:42,350
some reason and also who was doing the

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:46,549
packaging gave up for several reasons

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:50,029
and the point which was really lacking

00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:56,299
for us is the Python support also was

00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:59,389
only packaging the C library and the the

00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:03,950
reason for this was said we don't have C

00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:06,740
base that packaging system and also has

00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:09,380
rewritten the who did system but it was

00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,840
too complex for all the patent stuff and

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:15,350
so he just skipped it because he was not

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:19,309
needing his for his personal work so the

00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:21,750
only sensible way to get what we need so

00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:24,870
the peyten tensorflow support

00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:28,110
is to get the basal system to base the

00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:29,940
build system running yeah and we are now

00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:35,330
working on the basic build system there

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:40,700
are about six or a java pre dependencies

00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:45,180
needed I was just checking one of this

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:48,300
before I started this talk I'm not a

00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:51,930
Java programmer but I'm the draw our

00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:55,590
team is of great help and electeds also

00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:59,730
a lot of stuff he had contact to

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:02,550
upstream some Google programmers who

00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,950
helped him a lot he said without their

00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:07,410
help there was not really chance to do

00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:11,790
anything but they had really a lot and

00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:14,880
so we are maybe in two or three months

00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:18,090
as we will see an upload to new of basil

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,210
and once basil is in Debian I think it's

00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:24,390
needs some bootstrapping as well so it's

00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:27,780
a little bit complex but I remember the

00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:31,370
help of FTP master was so huge and I'm

00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:34,140
very positive that this will pass soon

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:39,860
so if you have basil then tensor flow

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:44,220
shouldn't be a problem anymore right and

00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:46,530
once we have tens of flow huge amount of

00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,120
other software it will be possible in

00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,250
Debian and maybe also basil is

00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:54,110
interesting for for other stuff I don't

00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:56,940
know basil but I have felt this other

00:31:54,110 --> 00:32:00,120
stuff that this build was basil which we

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,800
could also be interesting I just noticed

00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,720
we've lost our back as well so I'm going

00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:08,220
to realize some questions from are you

00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:14,100
back okay are you going to relate the

00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:17,070
questions from RC did you feel for

00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:22,260
researchers actually using new packages

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:26,790
further well researchers are not very

00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:31,140
purpose about their usage we have only

00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:34,920
popcorn numbers sorry and popcorn

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:40,530
numbers are pretty low for this

00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:43,200
kind of better software a lot of people

00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:47,010
are using our packages why are you born

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,870
2 because 2 is very popular probably

00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:52,800
somebody told them your body is easy to

00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:57,300
use well whatever it's fine because we

00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:59,250
be down here as long as we get some kind

00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,220
of back reports from Ubuntu which

00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:06,000
educates we can enhance our software and

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:10,290
so that's fine but you know popcorn is

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,020
not very reliable on to determine how

00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:15,960
many people are using it I can tell that

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:18,330
in in my Institute it's forbidden to

00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:23,400
send back any data source popcorn is

00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:26,040
switched off so this is some packages

00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,650
that are frequently used not reported by

00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:32,690
a popcorn which I know for sure and it's

00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:39,210
pole is very same in other institutions

00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:42,060
so we don't know I have some private

00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:47,990
exchange with scientists who say oh you

00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:49,560
are doing it right up but that's all

00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:55,710
what we know

00:33:49,560 --> 00:34:01,740
let's feedback are there are meeting

00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:06,540
notes for the ethical we have we have

00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:10,880
only the chat locks I can I can send the

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,880
link and I'll see about the chat locks

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:28,540
wait a minute sorry I interrupted you

00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:30,579
yeah well I need to check out where I

00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:42,490
have these chat locks it's it's

00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:45,819
somewhere not really a question also

00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:49,389
from IRC so thank you for your work and

00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:52,980
for the nice background today yeah yeah

00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:57,599
as I said it was a dream of mine to

00:34:52,980 --> 00:35:06,900
speak from outside all right this is no

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:12,369
and we're so here are the chitchat locks

00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:15,790
it's not very informative about what we

00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:22,150
talked about is justice maybe links we

00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:27,549
pointed to and yeah I agree that it

00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:32,500
would be better to have more logging

00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:36,970
more documentation and stuff but you

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:39,700
know there are so many tasks and we gave

00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:49,559
and there more new packages higher

00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:55,980
preferences and the more documentation I

00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:55,980
am trying to show this doing

00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,510
yeah

00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:18,390
right now I don't see more questions and

00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:24,680
we have 9 minutes 5 minutes what can i

00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:26,970
can continue telling something about

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:33,210
work in our team

00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:36,300
I can well the thing is I'm really happy

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:40,950
about the cooperation with google Summer

00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:47,880
of Code students they are I have created

00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:51,290
a list of Debian mid maintained package

00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:55,530
which is ordered according to popularity

00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:58,530
contests and has not yet outer package

00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:01,230
tests and so they are working down this

00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:05,690
list starting with most popular packages

00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:09,780
and writing tests one after the other

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:13,710
this was the original task and in cope

00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:19,340
with 19 sprint we I edit another list

00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:22,920
which is only considering the code 19

00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:27,350
relevant packages so they can focus and

00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:31,860
the actual topic and I consider this

00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:35,520
testing very important because we learnt

00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,030
a lot about packages that are not

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,320
working

00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:47,460
oh come on again can you please confirm

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:52,290
that you can hear me yes ok and what we

00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:54,570
are also doing the what is not so

00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:59,580
obviously connected with a team and my

00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:03,930
team is a Debian our team we have a lot

00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:08,550
of packages in in our coccyx room our

00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:10,830
language and but this is in a separate

00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:14,480
team the our package team which makes

00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:17,849
some sense because the technique is very

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:22,229
unique overall our packages

00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:23,579
and this is also interesting because in

00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:26,249
two years ago

00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,529
I personally was suffering from not

00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:30,869
covet 19 pass in Forenza and so I did

00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:31,799
something else I did something what was

00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:36,269
really necessary

00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:39,119
I wrote a script which created our

00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:41,369
packages automatically and not only the

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,979
package with autism who will dependency

00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:48,329
tree and this help now a lot so also

00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:50,130
this illness help now to make things

00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:54,180
more efficient so people are wondering

00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:56,699
how I can create 20 packages in a role

00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,829
but this script is creating all the git

00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:03,150
repositories for all the dependencies

00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:05,789
and I just needs very few many little

00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:10,349
tweaks and then I can upload the package

00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:13,829
so it happened that that uploaded 22

00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:16,049
packages on one day which is not so

00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:19,829
amazing at it sounds because it's all

00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:22,199
done automatically as also we have kind

00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:28,499
of productivity in the GB on our team

00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:31,289
and there's one person whose is it is

00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:33,630
dialing I see who is basically doing

00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:36,630
most of the work which I have done

00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:40,190
formally in this team he had done a

00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:44,880
great job for the hour for transition

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:48,739
which was in the 10 days ago about it

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:56,009
was a high phase of the transition and

00:39:48,739 --> 00:40:00,690
we had managed to to transit about 1000

00:39:56,009 --> 00:40:04,160
packages in in one week or so this was

00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:06,479
really cool and a lot of a lot of

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,999
Epidemiology packages and bioinformatics

00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:13,829
packages are also they are and are also

00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:16,529
listed in our carbon 19 2000 if you are

00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:21,900
interested in can WA are you find a lot

00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:23,400
of packages and if you send us and mail

00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:27,930
to the Debian our list

00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:30,420
I need this package then we can either

00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,480
teach you how to build it because so

00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:36,490
simple

00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:41,200
or we can do it really quickly yeah what

00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:58,450
else can do any more questions about

00:40:41,200 --> 00:41:00,490
this five minutes left I can keep on

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:04,030
talking about the nice image we have

00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:07,060
also nice boots I have people in Germany

00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:10,900
we say if you work from home it's in

00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:14,740
German German English called Home Office

00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:18,250
it sounds strange to English native

00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:21,310
speakers because this Ministry of you

00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:23,590
know affairs in red button but yes in

00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,600
Germany say Home Office but I turned it

00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,730
into nature office I've found the place

00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,970
in the woods where I can sit very

00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:34,560
comfortably internet coverage is

00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:37,720
sufficient but an even better place is

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,330
where there is no internet coverage I

00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,400
can tell you I was very efficient there

00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:45,400
because you are not distracted from

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,640
anything you can concentrate on your

00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,030
work

00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:52,869
a lot without any emails incoming this

00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:55,450
out ALC and so this is kind of very

00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:59,770
interesting so I can recommend go to

00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:03,760
NATO office if you have it around you

00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:07,540
are not in any danger to get infected by

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,030
somebody you have fresh air strengthen

00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:13,210
your immune system so it is very healthy

00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:17,859
I can really recommend it and my place

00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:23,350
is the perfect place for for this yeah

00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:30,550
but yeah so far I think this basically

00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:33,190
what I want to say okay a lot of value

00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:35,770
of debian is adopting packages to Debian

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:38,500
policy and the rest of the system what

00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:40,890
are the trade-offs you notice balancing

00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:44,170
this against all the automotive packages

00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:46,710
where you don't have time to do that

00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,710
sort of thing

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,660
well I've seen a lot of effects though I

00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:55,940
had to answer this and adapting our

00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:59,719
packages to Debian policy is very easy

00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:03,499
there are policy compliant because when

00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:07,130
you fetch something from Akron they are

00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:11,239
either of perfectly fitting into policy

00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:14,359
or they are have an error also on Akron

00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:18,979
and you can go to the maintenance and

00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:22,459
fixes we have the other thing is the

00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:24,619
Java packet ring which is usually in

00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:28,119
conflict with the demand policy because

00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:32,119
the Java style of dealing with things is

00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:34,160
including binary jars which is totally

00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:38,680
in contrast of the caller policy and so

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,680
we have to we need to do a lot of work

00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:46,219
this is a reason why we are so fast in

00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:49,190
issuing our packages and so slow and if

00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:51,410
you enjoy our packages but it needs to

00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:54,170
be done anyway and solve Eve I'm very

00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:56,989
happy about any help with with Java

00:43:54,170 --> 00:44:03,680
packaging we need Java programmers this

00:43:56,989 --> 00:44:04,789
is we can also it's very helpful of even

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,630
people who never heard about

00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:12,019
bioinformatics and medicine this is what

00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:14,329
I forgot to say because usually if I'm a

00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:17,180
tech conf and in the title is medicine

00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:20,329
or biology say auditorium is mostly

00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:23,140
empty but if I leave out the title and

00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:27,469
find some other crazy title the

00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:31,339
auditorium is usually filled so we are

00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:33,529
not biologists only we are not medical

00:44:31,339 --> 00:44:35,839
persons only we need packages and

00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:38,150
competent people in programming so if

00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:43,609
Java programmers can join us this would

00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:46,819
be really helpful so and now sir I see

00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:48,739
another question on our C suffers an

00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:51,529
internet connection in the German woods

00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:55,759
doesn't it make sense well the German

00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:58,400
woods and there are even German places

00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,820
in Germany which are not wood spots

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,400
really

00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:03,410
and so on not very good covered with

00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,420
internet connection I can tell you from

00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:09,860
personal experiences I was traveling by

00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:12,920
train from Berlin to the Baltic Sea and

00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:15,680
when leaving Berlin I was sometimes in

00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,930
the chain half an hour without internet

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,400
connection just railway stations hits

00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:32,270
internet connection so it's mmm it could

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:35,710
be better but yes okay welcome it was a

00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:35,710
