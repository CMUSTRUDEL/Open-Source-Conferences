good morning afternoon or whatever time

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,740
zone it is here

00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,980
welcome to bringing Debian to mobile

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,070
phones one package at a time if you

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,270
could please on IRC precede your

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,000
questions with question in all caps and

00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,430
then I can relay them once I've compiled

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,090
them thank you very much everybody it

00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,090
welcome Illinois

00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,120
all right guess you should hear me now

00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:02,930
sorry about that

00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:05,059
hello everyone thanks for joining so

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:09,530
we're talking about the current efforts

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:12,950
into bringing while bringing Debian to

00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:17,210
mobile phones currently so basically

00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:20,979
I'll go to a short introduction with a

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:24,679
short history of Linux on mobile next

00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:26,840
then speak about what's going on about

00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:30,560
packaging mobile friendly software for

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:35,509
Debian and how to use the Beyond on a

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,460
few select mobile phones right now so

00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:40,250
first a few words about me I'm an

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:44,830
embedded software engineer specializing

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:47,360
in Linux systems mostly speaking of

00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,659
integration bootloader and kernel

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,960
related issues I'm working for

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:56,079
collaborative probably had guest been a

00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,909
long time free and open source software

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,970
enthusiastically using Linux for the

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:05,299
last 20 years or so and I've been a

00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,759
deviant user since the woody release so

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:13,310
recently became a Debian contributor

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:15,410
after having a lot of time in the latest

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,170
you're asking myself how I could give

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,950
back to the community and you can grab

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:25,370
me on IRC my nickname is away so let's

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:28,220
get to the pointer currently the mobile

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,760
phones OS landscape is not really nice

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,079
for us open-source software users

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,040
basically it's an Android iOS duopoly

00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:40,340
and white technically Android uses Linux

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,690
at least for the kernel but lots of user

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:48,079
space software and all the stuff Andrew

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:52,070
it builds upon is either closed source

00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:55,310
or really really different from what we

00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,980
use what we're used to in our standard

00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,130
Linux distributions and of course aside

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,010
from a few projects such as line aged OS

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:10,790
based on Android we like a fully open

00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:14,030
source options so how did Linux came to

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:16,220
mobile devices first well to my

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,790
knowledge it all started with strapped

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:23,770
zeros and then you can see a few devices

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:27,710
over time but always almost always

00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:31,790
within using a sum properly

00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:35,390
proprietary software stack or UI your

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:38,660
stuff like that and it was really

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:41,720
difficult until a few years back to get

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,570
some some mobile phone on mobile device

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,580
in general running standard Linux and

00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,570
things you could take arrays and hack

00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:54,140
the system to your likes

00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:55,850
hopefully now there are a few open

00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,780
source software Linux based mobile

00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:02,750
projects these are the main ones are UV

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,630
ports which is taking over you were to

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:08,420
touch after can only call stop

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,940
supporting it and there is post market

00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:15,200
OS which is gaining some traction right

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,590
now may molester which is building upon

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,799
what

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:24,400
when Nokia stopped basically when they

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:26,960
dropped memo Nemo mobile it's rather the

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,650
open-source foundation to sailfish OS

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,220
it's based on Mego and finally you know

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:37,720
essa is the community maintained port of

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:41,090
webOS which used to be Palma rasa and

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:45,790
evolved into webOS when LG both the

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:48,770
system one interesting note here is that

00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,140
post-market OS is the only one which is

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,630
really close to a standard Linux

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,290
distribution and doesn't add a whole lot

00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:01,490
of custom UI or custom libraries or

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,620
custom services but yeah apart from that

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,890
basically you just have a whole

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,320
ecosystem even though MIMO less can be

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:13,250
related to Debian as it's based on dev

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,300
one it still are still far from being a

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,910
standard Linux

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:21,570
and just things you could put to other

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:26,130
distributions when it comes to hardware

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:30,320
support so far it's mostly used on

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:33,360
Android phones using the helium project

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,900
which means most of the time you have no

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,890
mainline support and often have to use

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:43,080
outdated vendor kernels but fortunately

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,720
it has been a new players in the last

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:50,160
couple of years which are purism with

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:53,610
the Librium 5 smartphone and point 64

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,210
with the pine phone and soon the pine

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,640
tab interesting points with this is that

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,330
they use or try to use at least a

00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,240
mainline Linux kernel every development

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,090
is done in the open you have a gate lab

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,910
group on github.com for point 64 where

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,650
you'll find the kernel boot loader and

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:20,180
untrusted firmware for these devices and

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:22,440
purism runs gate lab instance which is

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,640
publicly available and you can even

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:31,530
register and submit issues or mud

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,830
requests and indeed this two companies

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:38,030
are really really accepting and

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:40,370
encouraging contributions and

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:46,010
upstreaming is a goal for both of them

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:49,860
so now that we have some companies I say

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:52,800
supporting officially a standard Linux

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:57,540
distributions or at least a standard way

00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,750
of dealing with Linux systems what can

00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:04,260
we do to to improve that from a Debian

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:08,010
perspective first we can package mobile

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,270
friendly software for Debian and you

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,880
have to understand the whole mobile

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,860
software stack yeah basically it's kind

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,390
of a standard Linux stack you have the

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,410
kernel and boot loader effort which has

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:21,210
really obviously Hardware specific and

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,130
then you have the base system which is

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,160
the base user space libraries and

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,730
utilities things like system D network

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,800
manager and

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:34,510
the the shell and everything we

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,080
fortunately for Debian we have already

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:40,300
that which is available for um v7 you

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,780
have the arm HFD beyond architecture and

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:47,740
for 64-bit zombie eight you have arm 64

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:50,440
and really all the base software needed

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,970
is already in the Debian archive so

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,690
that's really a good point to start with

00:07:51,970 --> 00:08:00,550
and on top of that you have to have a

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:04,480
graphical environment of course and both

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:07,620
there are two currently which are the

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,810
most advanced I think and the most

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,360
appealing to existing mobile phone users

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:17,160
these are for sure which is driven by

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:22,470
purism and basically it's known based

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:26,920
you have a specific compositor and and

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:29,020
the graphical shell but on top of that

00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:34,680
everything is really known based and

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,680
using the same demons and had software

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,979
then you have plasma mobile which is

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:44,710
basically the KDE counterpart to for the

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:47,230
didn't make any official release yet but

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,210
it still work in progress and I believe

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,640
it's making good progress currently and

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:55,660
of course you have to have mobile

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:58,840
friendly user facing applications so

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,540
with this in mind does the Debian team

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,730
called Debian on mobile it's a team

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,340
dedicated to packaging software which

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,550
might be useful for owners on of mobile

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,920
devices we are currently focusing on

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,740
getting the four graphical environment

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,650
and no mobile friendly apps into the

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:21,490
Debian archive we have already uploaded

00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:24,490
a couple basic packages such as Levangie

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:30,190
or feedback gee Levangie being some

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:33,820
library for making gtk applications

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,920
usable on a mobile phone the graphical

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,680
environment also the base packages are

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,260
here which are fork the food Weyland

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,130
compositor and for the

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,740
graphical shell itself and we're still

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:50,560
working on many more packages such as

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:54,760
lip purple plugins because as a mobile

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:58,870
users instant messaging is a big deal

00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:01,720
and really important so the purple

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:06,100
plugins are important to be able to

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:10,800
communicate with various IM networks i'd

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:13,990
say such as matrix XMPP excel and so on

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,330
and also an on-screen que you order

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:22,810
which is quick bottom developed by

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:25,300
purism also regarding other apps some of

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:28,420
the new maps already have an adaptive UI

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,930
which means they can scale from a

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:35,380
desktop app to a mobile app depending on

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,270
the screen size num contacts num clocks

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,660
and there's some recorder are just a few

00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:43,150
examples but you have really quite a bit

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,430
of them unfortunately lots of

00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:48,040
application are really not designed for

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,080
use on small screens so we need to work

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,580
with upstream developers to improve that

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:57,550
and afterwards when we have our changes

00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:00,940
our merger we can finally package these

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,850
applications or improve the current

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,790
packaging of cell applications to have

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,220
them available for mobile users we're

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,620
doing this to salsa group and we also

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,480
have a matrix channel to discuss all of

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:19,870
that but keep the output util-links

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,580
at the end of the presentation too so

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:26,200
what if we want to use debian on a

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:30,300
mobile phone right now well this is a

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:33,070
project i started a few weeks ago mobian

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,780
projector it's an independent project

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:40,270
from debian it was started initially

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,790
basically because i wanted to create a

00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:47,200
debian i image for the PI phone and just

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:49,720
received so it was all hacks and stuff

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,840
at the beginning but all in all it

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,760
evolved it to something cleaner and more

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,700
generic but

00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,760
bass reasoning behind that is that not

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:04,270
all packages we need for one specific

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:08,800
device can go into Debian for the pine

00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:11,710
form for example the kernel is a

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,810
downstream kernel maintained by pine 64

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,840
at the moment because there are still

00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:24,760
lots of bits that needs to be a merge

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:28,030
upstream so we can't really just put all

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,670
the patches to Debian and we rather have

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:33,160
to wait until they go a stream before we

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:37,330
can benefit from this into the Debian

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,700
archive and there are also some packages

00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,670
that we worked on as part of the Debian

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,800
on mobile team that are uploaded to

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,830
Debian but still waiting in the new

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,770
queue and we need them right now to work

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:53,680
on the bind phone so basically the whole

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:57,430
idea was to set up a separate repo to

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,190
hold this packages while we wait for for

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,900
them to reach the main Debian archive

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,270
it's drawing it to a more general

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,870
project than just simply an image for

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:10,180
Python we she's providing a basic

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:15,130
infrastructure to target various mobile

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:17,020
devices and provider immediately every

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,660
package needed to run Debian or

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,760
supported devices the goals of the

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,770
project are to minimize changes and

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,590
contribute back to Debian as much as

00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,930
possible collaborate with both Debian

00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:32,650
and upstream authors to improve software

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:34,990
and packaging and in the end we just

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,880
want to make GB on a popular platform

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:41,800
for mobile devices and gain some

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:44,260
traction is this in this field so mobian

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,410
is based on bullseye because quite a few

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:50,470
software in stable is a bit outdated for

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,420
our use case err we use the main Debian

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,240
archive as the primary package source

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:58,360
and we provide a minimal overlay package

00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:03,010
archive which is targeting currently the

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:07,330
amd64 arm hf and arm 64 architectures

00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:08,080
and we don't hold much packages in this

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,720
in this

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:15,880
archival we have a 120 packages we

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:19,150
imported from Debian and and have to

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,720
patch for them to work better on a small

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:28,000
display these are mostly no Maps with

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:32,140
some UI patches generally taken taken

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,210
from the purism work also a couple ones

00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,270
such as modem manager with a few

00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:40,180
different compile options we also have

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:43,270
some packages which are uploaded in

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,250
Debian as we want them but waiting in

00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,100
the new queue as I mentioned before so

00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:51,790
we simply make them available through

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:55,180
our own repo and the few custom packages

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,910
which are mostly meta packages and some

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:01,420
tweaks to the pol kit policies and

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,820
default config the images themselves are

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,760
generated using dubose on a daily basis

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,430
and we currently only have one package

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,560
feeder but we plan to add another one so

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:18,970
that we have a staging repo and the main

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:21,910
stable sort of stable repo so what's

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:25,420
next time we plan to target a bit more

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:27,720
devices we plan to support the Librium 5

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,850
and the pine tab by the end of the year

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,960
depending on when we get a higher

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:36,250
unhealth her hands on them sorry and

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,550
more devices may be added in the future

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:43,060
depending on how they are available to

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:47,680
different developers of the project we

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:50,470
might provide more UI options personally

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,080
prefer working on 4th but if somebody

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,840
isn't reading into packaging and helping

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,940
porting plasma mobile that could be an

00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,350
option maybe a full-featured gnome

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,970
desktop mostly for the pine table we'd

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,660
like to integrate more closely into

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:10,180
Debian the project is still young only a

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,090
couple of weeks old but why not

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,480
integrate some bits into Debbie onna

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:19,960
become part of the GBM project somehow

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,850
or even use extra poor as I just learnt

00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,209
about it this morning for the mobi

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,850
honoree

00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:26,290
for the trip and of course keep working

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:31,179
on new packages and improved

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:33,309
infrastructure so basically to wrap it

00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:35,110
up debian on mobile is a long time

00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:38,829
before to bring every needed package

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,720
into debian mobi analyst quick testing

00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:45,240
and building I made for the pine phone

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:49,540
and hopefully more devices soon and

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,699
while the basic problem here is that

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,509
more mobile friendly apps are needed

00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:58,449
such as the calendar I am clients and

00:16:54,509 --> 00:17:02,079
name whatever you'd like and of course

00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:04,659
we open to contribution and welcome

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:09,939
everyone wanted to work on this on this

00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:13,600
area so here are some links about the

00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:17,559
two projects so feel free to reach out

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,630
to us and afraid we won't have many time

00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:25,209
for questions but you can ask one or two

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:27,659
I guess that's it for me thanks everyone

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,659
