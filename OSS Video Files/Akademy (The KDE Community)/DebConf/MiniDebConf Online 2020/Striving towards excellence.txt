next talk is jonathan cata our DP Oh

00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:15,789
presenting striving towards excellence

00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,050
hello and welcome to my talk entitled

00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:19,510
striving towards excellence something

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,300
that I think is somewhat ingrained in

00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,340
our Debian culture well what is

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,710
excellence I think in simplest terms

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,510
it's something it's about being really

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,980
good at something and there's lots of

00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,529
things in Debian that we're really good

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,930
at and some not so much

00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:37,390
my goal of this talk is more to get us

00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,789
as a project to think more about how we

00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:43,359
can make Debian more excellent and and

00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:45,969
as excellent as possible so originally

00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:50,409
when I started preparing this talk I had

00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:52,329
about 10 broad topics and my talk was

00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,039
about two hours long the first time I

00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:56,409
try to estimate how long it would be and

00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,420
I had to cut it back so I cut it back to

00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:00,760
three topics and eventually added

00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,280
another new one to you so now what we

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:07,119
have is basically four broad categories

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,000
that it fits in today's bugs mentoring

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,960
crafts and games and games might not

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,390
seem like it fits completely in this

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,740
theme but there's some things I want to

00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,990
say about that and that I want to

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:25,510
convince you of so let's see if I'll be

00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:28,780
able to do that in this talk so here's

00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:31,330
an image of a poster on there on a mall

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,270
shop that says mall maintenance shop we

00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:37,630
can repay anything please knock hard on

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:40,060
the door the Bell doesn't work now I

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,510
first lost when I saw this it's somewhat

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:47,410
funny but it's also a bit said that the

00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:48,670
sometimes reminds me of us in Debian and

00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,409
there's someone who cares about

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,930
excellence in Debian it does paid me a

00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:54,640
little to say so but so don't hate me

00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:59,050
for throwing a little criticism my way I

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:03,250
love Debian but sometimes it is true

00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,750
that we we make all these workarounds

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,490
and things and they become part of our

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,590
culture like this is where you do it and

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,509
no one thinks of changing it because

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,180
it's a habit and we're used to doing it

00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:16,830
and there's lots of things that's been

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,810
in a weird way for a long time that

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,670
that that we should rather fix brother

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,830
then take the time to make a poster and

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,600
explain workarounds and things like we

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:30,060
often do so we have to be pragmatic to

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,580
you like if we want to fix every little

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,250
bug in Debian before releasing we'll

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,080
never make a release there will always

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,480
be one more thing that we have to fix

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:46,320
before it can go out so yeah

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,080
what I find more of a problem is when we

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,240
have a bug that's very user visible that

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,900
would maybe even just take a few minutes

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,790
or hours to fix and it happens with one

00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,580
release and then again in the next

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,170
release because users one day like does

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,840
anything actually gets fixed in Debian

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:09,030
and the meantime lots of things do but

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,490
those small user visible things can add

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,320
up and really make Debian requests and

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,690
another system when it might not

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,070
actually be the case I'm going to see

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:24,900
one example of those so on screen and

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:26,420
this is xfce in scratch ambassador I

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,220
remember when I first installed

00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,870
exception in scratch I just happened to

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:36,090
know that the run icon was missing that

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,680
was always day and I thought oh they'll

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,450
fix this this seems like an obvious

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,310
enough problem and then ambassador got

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,890
released and it got even worse because

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,750
now except 0z winners a missing icon so

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,019
best was released of this missing icon

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,550
icon full of run program which was kind

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,080
of horrible I didn't like that I wish

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,160
that we didn't have to do stuff like

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,780
this in Debian and I'm not at all I

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,120
think on the xfce team like this is

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,150
literally thousands of this kind of bugs

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,500
scattered all over Debian and affected

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,840
it would take just a few minutes to fix

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,310
I almost feel like it makes it worse

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:14,600
rather than better and at least this is

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:17,010
fixed now in in testing actually XFC is

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,940
fantastic interesting that a lot of

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,740
other fixes and polishing on the XFC

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,630
they stopped - so the XFC team is doing

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,190
a good job but they're also still

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,310
looking for contributors and people who

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,540
help with packaging upstream xfce so if

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:36,420
you have some packaging

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:38,460
Denis available please go out then so

00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,280
I'm also to say human tastes remained

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,380
valuable too because if you had a few

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,600
had some automated signetics screenshots

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,230
of this and so if there's a icon missing

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:54,390
there it might see that that missing

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:56,550
icon icon as an icon and and there may

00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,090
give you like a false positive that it's

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,500
it's actually working fine so I think I

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:07,350
think Antonio's talk yesterday about

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,270
Auto pkg test was fantastic and I think

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,100
everyone should go watch that but at the

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,010
same time I also think human testing

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,130
remains valuable - like with you when we

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,200
do ISO testing and because machines

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,390
won't always find everything that's

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,570
wrong I think the combination of both is

00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,280
absolutely important because if you if

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,200
you have to do all the tests that the

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:33,450
machines do by hand it will just waste

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:36,030
way too much time so fun pick so this

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,980
brings me to a topic that that I've

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,250
talked a lot about in the past but it

00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,620
never got any traction and that is the

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,420
100 paper cuts project I know some

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,830
people are probably saying when they see

00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,030
that because I talked about it so much

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:53,700
in the past and then nothing happened so

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,470
the idea is that bugs like this these

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,310
small bugs that is actually quick to fix

00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,810
that give the user the impression that

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,670
then the quality of the system isn't

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,000
quite as good as it actually is we call

00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:08,880
these paper cuts but because they're

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,460
very small but to give it a like it's

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,200
like they can really ruin your

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,610
experience and this concepts actually

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,470
originates from going to their death 500

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,170
paper cuts project was a thousand I

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,990
can't remember and during that period

00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,150
when I read this project the quality you

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,610
know when to desktop really took often

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:33,720
especially issues that affected users

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,070
got fixed really quickly and I think

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,490
even though it didn't take off I think

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:41,040
it would be good to to still get it

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,050
going but I'm extremely busy in the last

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,250
well and I've so many projects in Debian

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,110
that I don't pretty

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,840
have any bandwidth to start another one

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,330
so I'm actually asking if anyone's

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,550
watching that has time to take this over

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,160
and build on it and get a community

00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,630
around it both and figure out how to do

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,500
it and take it forward I would really

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,630
appreciate that

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,900
other words maybe I'll end up doing it

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,810
often my DP out him but that's like 11

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,980
months away and I credited rather have

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:13,470
someone do this now then the next year

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,600
so what do that him tell well it's not a

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,610
lot of difficult work so you basically

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,620
have to organize both sessions at things

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,330
like mini dev console monthly meet or

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,880
some monthly meeting on IRC what people

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,770
get together and talk about it this

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,170
could possibly happen as part of the QA

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:32,190
team and there should be some kind of

00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:34,650
process for nominating bugs fun ways to

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,600
organize issues like organize issues

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:41,070
like maybe you could have a category 4

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:43,950
server say the piper cats they start

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,390
like the cats and so on and way it

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,790
should be done I being a Debian bug

00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,130
tracking system when salsa both have

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:53,070
you'd present cars like salsa is very

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:56,690
easy to use for in uses and BTS

00:07:53,070 --> 00:08:00,540
integrates beta with all our existing

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:02,970
infrastructure other than that most of

00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,280
this project is just communication you

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,820
know just kind of beating the drum

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:12,930
getting people involved and organizing

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,460
so if you'd want to do this yeah you

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,990
don't need my permission or anything you

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,570
can just go ahead but if you do want

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,700
some help you can get in touch and I can

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,140
help you a bit with this as well but I'd

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,760
really appreciate it if someone that

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,820
could do this so that's paper cuts but

00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,440
there's also a kind of deeper cuts in

00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:35,490
Debian that also doesn't get attention

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,460
and this would be the type of things

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:41,339
that needs coordination between multiple

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,680
teams to fix and I think we shouldn't

00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,630
talk more about these as well I try to

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,210
get a good example of one of these and

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,589
one that I set of one was just every now

00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,110
and again I see someone complaining that

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,510
you know why do we have to do all their

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:57,230
packages on our system what do we need

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,780
Ruth to do that it's kind of a

00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,860
silly there's some so many new

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:05,990
technologies out there that allow you to

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,090
to do things in sandbox is namespaces

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,070
and we should take more advantage of

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,770
this in our cool tooling so if if

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:16,040
something like Alex C can run a complete

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,870
grid you know from a turret maybe our

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,280
tools can evolve to eventually use those

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:24,770
same underlying technologies that have

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:29,030
ended up in a kernel and inside that the

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:30,620
plumbing layer that might allow us to to

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,540
do things that this without even eating

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,230
roots or going outside of our home

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,060
directory

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,430
so I think there's some deep cuts that

00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,560
and this is just one but one of things

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,170
might maybe not even a good example but

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,330
I just want to get something of an

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,400
example of something that we take

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:50,210
multiple teams to code night and we work

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,680
together to fix it and we sometimes need

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:56,120
more of this so where this comes from is

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,730
I've been reading old I've been going

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,530
through the old debconf Debian developer

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,930
curves recently and back in nineteen

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,930
ninety eight ninety seven it was about

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:08,510
they people were having a discussion

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,490
about just identifying problems in

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,320
Debian not judging

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,880
not even though they weren't even

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,110
allowed to list solutions for the

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,900
problem in a thread you were only

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,340
allowed to list problems that's it and a

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,070
lot of good things came out of that

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:25,460
thread and I think at some point we need

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:28,910
to list or discover or talk about some

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,800
of our deeper problems more and and find

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,900
out what we needed to fix them what type

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,500
of people we need what which team should

00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:39,740
be involved just with more under kind of

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,110
deep cuts that that's more technically

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,570
challenging that you know weren't like

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:51,500
one person even a week to fix on their

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:57,770
own so I'm being busy this is an image

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:59,690
of this picture is a lego man with with

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,400
round wheels offering to help other Lego

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,710
people who are pulling a cart of square

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:08,000
wheels and I said no thanks we're too

00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:10,370
busy also said to admit that sometimes

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,089
this is me I keep hearing people talk

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,910
about wonderful

00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,720
Debian and I just don't find the time to

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,910
get into it

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,550
it likes me that I haven't had time to

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:22,129
get into dig it yet and also author

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,499
became she tastes that Antonia talked

00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,089
about yesterday

00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:28,040
but at the same time also everyone is

00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:31,699
human and it's it's sometimes really

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,529
hard to find time to improve but what

00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,449
I'm asking everyone is watching is to

00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:38,569
stay aware of this concept and try to

00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:40,550
make time to learn new things because if

00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,889
you just wait for time for the right

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,259
time it just never happens it's just

00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:48,529
always something they to occupy your

00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:50,959
time to grab your attention and to steal

00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:53,959
you away from learning new important

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,180
things also I think Deb contaminated

00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,610
kind of and even the online versions of

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:03,439
those are so important during the talks

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:04,519
this weekend I saw a few instances with

00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:06,079
people who I thought would not like

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,850
everything about Vivian said Wow

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,350
I did not know about that and I did not

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,809
know about that and many people learning

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,809
new valuable things during this these

00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:16,550
sessions that we had so I think doing

00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:18,199
more of this kind of thing would also be

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,240
great just for that because we're

00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:24,160
basically making some time to share

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,689
skills and then and I think that's

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,720
completely fantastic and that helps us

00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:34,129
avoid being the person with the square

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:40,339
wheels in this picture so that brings me

00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:43,629
or sedimentary just one second I thought

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:45,980
sad notes for this slide anyway

00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:49,459
mentoring is critically important in

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,230
improving in Debian because there's

00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:53,779
there's so many people who casually

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,490
wants to help and we should take

00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,949
advantage of them and some of them will

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:01,519
grow into Debian developers at the time

00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:04,189
as well and I suggest that everyone who

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,959
every Debian developer takes maybe at

00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:07,790
least even an hour every month to

00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,759
sponsor packages of metals that Debian

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:13,009
dotnet sponsor packages submitted to BTS

00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:16,339
I don't know what the exact number is

00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:17,959
but it's huge days I think now I don't

00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:20,750
want to make a guess but there's many

00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:22,490
packages improvement

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,290
submitted to the BT a set of patches

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,720
attached to them

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,519
and many of them sit there a very very

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,160
long time and I think we should be

00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,690
better as a project to sponsor that and

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,790
take the contributions that we get from

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,829
outsiders and make sure that they get

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:42,589
either applied or get at least some

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:43,970
feedback and not a good way to get to do

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:47,360
this is also to work in a team and

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,190
maintain team mental packages and this

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,500
is working quite well in a number of

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:57,050
teams at the moment and the sponsor

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:59,540
request for sponsor RFA's bugs what was

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:04,610
a good thing to do find the request for

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:07,040
sponsorship packages in the BTS but I

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,540
know for I've also talked to some Debian

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,699
developers who said that say that they

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:15,199
don't like doing this kind of work

00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:17,060
because it's sometimes hard and you have

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:22,279
to deal with people and people are weird

00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:24,800
and difficult to work with and it's it's

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,870
difficult and it was difficult for me

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,130
when I started working with they think

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:33,230
they've been as well I remember after

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:36,980
DEFCON 7 hi I decided I'm going to learn

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,990
packaging and be really good at

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,199
everything there being so I read through

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,639
there be a new mentor in the guide and

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,079
everything made sense all the individual

00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,850
parts sounded really good and another

00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,579
side okay I'm going to make a package

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,190
and I didn't know where to start it was

00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:54,529
just so confusing and I found that as a

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:58,220
new Mantegna guide as a reference works

00:14:54,529 --> 00:15:01,339
really well as a guide I don't think it

00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,920
works all that much so when people from

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,720
Debian and Ubuntu also actually first

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,019
have been to an Indian started to help

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,730
me with packaging that clumps of

00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:12,350
knowledge came together and the

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,870
experience is there that I transferred

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,279
to me I really made everything fit

00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,880
together and where can I think this

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,860
image explains expands that and why

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,100
mentoring is also so important in Debian

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,170
we can't just depend on our

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,899
documentation to let people learn we

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,689
should really go the extra mile to help

00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:35,510
people along and guide them through the

00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:43,610
process of becoming a Debian developers

00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:45,380
a man I'd lost my place one second so I

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:50,810
was talking about mentoring being

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:54,380
difficult for Debian developers I can

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:56,330
tell you that when you mean to someone

00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,420
else your your skills will improve as

00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:02,180
well not only in how to teach people but

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,740
to tell ask you questions about Debian

00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,810
packaging or even show you things that

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,030
you didn't know existed and I've become

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,370
a better packaging the better Debian

00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,930
packages and due to the mentoring work

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,520
that I've done with other people and

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,310
there's been lots of things in a song

00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,780
packages now I realized what does what

00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,820
did this person do you that they screw

00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,170
up or they're doing something new and

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,030
interesting that I didn't yet know

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,070
existed and then I go looking after

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,990
messy poop this is actually a thing and

00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,390
it works and it's quite awesome I should

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,580
do it more in my other packages so you

00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,500
will grow when you mentor it's a good

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,960
good way to spend your time it's

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,850
rewarding it's good for the project get

00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,310
out of your comfort zone and do it a bit

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,710
every month it's not as scary as it

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,000
sounds

00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:47,690
although it's sometimes does get

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,730
difficult it's it's it's the positives

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,620
far outweigh the little negatives that

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,180
come because now and again you get

00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,570
someone really stubborn who just

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:59,810
wouldn't listen and you wonder what

00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:02,990
should I do with this person sometimes

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,850
you feel should I just you know keep

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,260
hammering on the same thing over and

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,990
over in if they don't listen you just

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:13,190
told in told you so

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:16,339
or do you just tell them you know go

00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:19,820
ahead bump your head let it your own way

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,079
and eventually if you've realized that

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:25,720
you were completely wrong about this

00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:28,190
come back to me so what I've learned in

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,340
many packages that I've submitted for

00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,510
review when I was before I was a DD and

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,380
since then when I started reviewing

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:38,660
packages is that it's important to be

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,280
neutral so be careful of your time

00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,310
especially in written communications

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,890
because things the way you say it and

00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,780
how people read it isn't always the same

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,059
when it comes to written communication

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,789
and don't get person

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:55,940
don't say something like what they're

00:17:52,789 --> 00:18:00,440
doing here is really stupid it might be

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:02,570
but the word they might interpret it as

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,190
something really condescending and it

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,950
might push them away from actually

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,500
wanting to contribute more I stick to

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:13,149
the facts when you show them that

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:17,720
they're in policy says this listen this

00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:19,279
then then it they can see that it's not

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,480
just you being difficult who wants to

00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,600
make rules and make it more difficult

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,799
for them you're actually just you're

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,720
just really explaining to them how

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,000
Debian policy works now this should

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,789
really put that package together and so

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,230
something positive and sometimes you can

00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:36,380
thank them for their contribution to

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,890
Debian there's other ways you can do it

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,720
too what I often also do is say

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,279
excellent work you just said that these

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,990
four small things that you have to fix

00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,539
and once you've done that I'm ready to

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,299
upload it that sometimes a lot better

00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:51,649
than just listing you know four things

00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:55,010
and just the problems because otherwise

00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:57,230
they see it as a kind of attack on my

00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,919
work or just negative and it can also

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:03,200
deter them so always wrap any feedback

00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:10,100
you having something positive it helps a

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:12,740
lot for newcomers so I thought this

00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,830
image would be a nice link between the

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,970
topics of mentoring and craft and it's

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,980
the image of someone running way too

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,919
many holes to try and get the great bat

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,360
through so sometimes in some songs out

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,270
of necessity it takes some trial and

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,340
error to make things work but once it

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,610
does we should remove all the the craft

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:34,070
and extra things we shouldn't have too

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,049
many comments in our staff and too many

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,669
broken things that we thought might have

00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,559
worked or not work when we get something

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:43,700
that works we should make it as good as

00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:45,620
possible and and if all the bad things

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,539
behind that that didn't quite work

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,240
maybe document what happened and why did

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:52,399
it work but we have so much craft in

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,570
Debian that it's not really even funny

00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:58,760
ooh I don't think what anyone knows what

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,700
this image depicts if someone can make

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,980
it guess it's an image of a bunch of Toy

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,309
Story

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:10,359
characters that's been intermingled and

00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:13,149
mixed together so if you would guess

00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,830
that it's a Franklin Debian that's made

00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:18,279
out of different releases that would

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:20,049
probably not be a bad case but this is

00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:23,289
actually the Debian wiki that's what

00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:26,460
this represents because it started out

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:30,159
as one thing and got more use cases

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:33,039
tacked on to it and there's some

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:37,600
namespaces that's really good especially

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:39,460
like other teams but overall for

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,309
documentation we've kind of lost the

00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,989
plot there and I've talked to you I

00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:46,389
talked to some of the wiki team members

00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:48,850
about this recently and asked him what

00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:50,950
should we do how can we get people to

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,320
clean the wiki up and make it better and

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,590
make it something useful that we can be

00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,710
proud of and the message that I got back

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:02,200
basically was that well we need to first

00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,820
decide what we actually want to do with

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,460
the wiki and what we want to get out of

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,499
it and then we can actually put more

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,019
action in it so I hope that they

00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:12,940
actually together above or some session

00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:16,899
or so at the next step you get people

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:19,059
involved talk about it because I think

00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:21,340
especially for documentation they I

00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:23,440
think back then there was the idea that

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,989
it would be like a gentle wiki where we

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,249
had which had excellent documentation at

00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:30,039
the time these days it's more like the

00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:32,049
arch wiki that people go to but we

00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,600
really need that in the wiki in Debian

00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:37,720
maybe we maybe we need to rethink

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,909
documentation and our wiki holistically

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,109
completely at some point and just take a

00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:46,239
step back and figure out what to do they

00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:49,239
because I think it doesn't completely

00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:51,190
make sense anymore not the criticism on

00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:54,580
a wiki team of course and it's just the

00:21:51,190 --> 00:22:00,429
way things evolve and happen over the

00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:02,109
years then we also have craft in work

00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:05,350
leading and perspective packages this

00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:07,269
currently here's a list of 215 packages

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,239
that are ready for adoption the oldest

00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:11,470
is six thousand six hundred and thirty

00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:13,539
six days

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,090
that's actually quite significant more

00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:18,550
more than the second oldest package

00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:24,370
if you convert that in those 50 years

00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:26,710
that's 18 years old so that's that's a

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,780
really long time for package to be up

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:32,530
for adoption that since before we've

00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:37,870
been to even existed so there's a lot of

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:40,390
old packages in WN TP and the thing is

00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,040
we when new new contributors ask where

00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,750
what can we do with how can we have

00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:48,010
Debian this is a kind of stuff with

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:50,230
sometimes point empty and a lot of this

00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:54,490
craft me I've sorted it by age but

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:56,860
usually to just be by package name but

00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,690
it doesn't it's not really encouraging

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,330
for new contributors to see things like

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:03,280
this and there's there's so much stuff

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,620
in here that shouldn't even be in Debian

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,450
anymore for example this stuff like I

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,270
think it has been removed since I

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,130
thought about this now but there were

00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,700
stuff like I've been busy in there it

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,990
might still be in there that it's it's

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,000
not it's not going to be useful for

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,920
anyone anymore it's abandoned upstream

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,480
and probably has a bunch of security

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,670
issues it shouldn't it'll be in Debian

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,730
we should rather just file removes for

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,080
those things remove all this craft and

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,750
at least packages that are definitely

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:35,830
not useful anymore or can't really be

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:37,990
used and I mean if can use is that old

00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,360
my case it still uses cute for maybe

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:44,500
even q3 probably won't even run on

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:48,280
Debian anymore so we should just RM it

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,320
and close there close the request for

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,810
adoption bug instead of just having this

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,260
keep on plugging our system confusing

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:58,300
people maybe pushing away people would

00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,510
otherwise adopt some other useful

00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:04,000
packages on this page and the orphan

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,260
page is even worse and these are

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,030
packages that were up for adoption

00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,710
that's already orphaned

00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:13,060
there's a thousand one hundred and

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:15,070
eighty-eight of them also quite a few

00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:18,880
packages that are more than a few years

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:21,370
older than that so I think we should

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,260
maybe have a process that if I don't

00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,120
know what to put on it maybe if a probe

00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,280
if the package is often for five years

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,350
that even seems really long but I mean

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,179
look at what we have now

00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,370
if if it gets over a certain threshold

00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,799
we should just started thinking of

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,440
nominating it for removal and if someone

00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:42,909
really cares about it I can step up to

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:48,759
maintain it so so yeah that's it for

00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:52,360
craft fixing wiki issues pruning the

00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:54,039
package list I had some extra items yet

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,750
because I was going to talk about trends

00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,340
that they're being donated but I forgot

00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:00,070
to remove this when I removed those

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,870
slides my talk was way too long and but

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,730
I still have mentioned frames that

00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,100
they've been done it it's really cool

00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:12,039
website maintained by Lucas nose bump

00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:14,139
and he in some ways he tracks craft in

00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:16,929
there because he looks he cracks a lot

00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:21,039
of historical things in Darien and what

00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:23,879
has gotten better and worse and that

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,019
website highlights a few places where

00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:27,519
where we need to spend some more energy

00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:31,929
on and I think it's a great initiative

00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:33,850
and he also tends to add more crack more

00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:38,740
things in it so I would suggest and

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:42,309
taking a look at that for sure and

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,559
finally onto guidance why would I

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:48,009
mention this in in here house games

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,840
relevant well let's consider Debian on

00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:52,480
servers they've been as a great

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,889
reputation on servers and a huge user

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,629
base even with out including open to

00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,460
machines but you know you could you

00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:02,409
could probably at least link that they

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,379
might consider them to you but their

00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:07,299
beam is great on servers and is it

00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:09,309
because we're good at writing Network

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:12,580
specifications and implementing them or

00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:15,879
creating web servers databases scripting

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,039
engines no because we don't even do any

00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:19,690
of that we stand on the shoulders of

00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:21,879
giants and many other things that make

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,519
Debian wonderful actually comes from the

00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:26,529
upstream what makes Debian segrete is as

00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,659
a server platform specifically but also

00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:30,820
in other areas is that is all the work

00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:32,769
we do to integrate all the data stream

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,559
work and make it work well together

00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:37,029
it's it's it's still wonderful and

00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:39,789
people take it for granted how you can

00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:41,799
just start to install something and like

00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:42,820
a complicated database engine a web

00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:44,890
server and

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,960
within seconds it's configured and

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,320
running in and you didn't even have to

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,210
do much to do that but I've their grace

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,820
just like their videos I made years ago

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:57,030
as a good set of platform and we're

00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,470
actually entering an era now where

00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,810
Debian is really making strides towards

00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,910
becoming a really good gaming platform

00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,890
almost discernible that it's a good

00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,530
server platform and I know many people

00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,600
will be completely skeptical about that

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,030
when I say that but if I can manage to

00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,100
match your opinion on and that by 10

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:19,170
percent by the end of this talk then

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:22,570
I'll be happy with that so historically

00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:25,330
free games have been vastly inferior to

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:27,250
the non free counterparts but recently

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,800
free games have also spawned some great

00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:34,630
finishes so consider free Civ that this

00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:36,700
screenshot is of it's a fun game and of

00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:38,980
course it's not even in the same league

00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,010
as fancy as the newer proprietary

00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,650
versions of it but yeren here it keeps

00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,390
on changing and improving and I usually

00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,030
play this game on my flights on the way

00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:51,610
from Def Con to home and every year it's

00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:54,010
nice to see all the new stuff that just

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,780
added it it's it's not the same game it

00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:58,420
was a year ago a year before that me

00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:01,510
before that the rules get updated new

00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:04,450
nations and and languages and cities get

00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:07,210
added it's it keeps it fun to come back

00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:10,240
to every time and play again and I think

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:12,790
this is a nice nice aspect of free games

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,550
that they can keep on evolving like if

00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:17,200
you consider the original and

00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:19,810
civilization tooth that recently

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,030
submitted to it's always stuck being the

00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:25,120
same thing but the free free game

00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:28,240
conference need to grow and evolve and

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,220
that's wonderful and we're getting into

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,060
stages with certain games are growing

00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:36,600
large enough communities that that they

00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:42,510
really start to rival somewhere and

00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:44,800
proprietary games and this is also 3d

00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:47,200
WebGL vision that someone might have

00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,910
free Civ it's not the version it's just

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,280
an interface so it uses the exact same

00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,660
game engine it's the same game it just

00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,110
looks completely different you run it in

00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,730
your browser and

00:28:54,110 --> 00:29:03,400
it's rendered with more 3d technologies

00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:03,400
and then these games like 0id they also

00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:08,570
change things up a bit

00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:10,190
also gaming Debian this is still a

00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,200
relatively new game even though it's in

00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:16,910
development for a few years I think they

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:18,590
don't consider it version one yet but

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,960
what's not to be about this game is that

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,000
not only are they writing a great game

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,590
and they've grown a big community behind

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,980
it they also have their own funding and

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:33,200
what their own funding platform and ways

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,830
to fund developers to work on it and

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,890
they're also a project with HP is like

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:42,140
Debian is I think for bigger games we

00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:46,340
might see more and more games like this

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:47,510
that that that's that's managed and

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,250
treated more likely important piece of

00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:51,380
say the software more than just one

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:54,980
person working on the game they spare

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:58,850
time for a little bit every year so that

00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:00,140
these off to free games that are fine

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:04,220
notable but there are actually a lot

00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,860
more in Debian like tax racer and mine

00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,810
taste and the list is just growing

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,820
the free the list of free games that's

00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:13,490
actually worthwhile that the kids wanted

00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:16,730
play is growing immensely in Debian and

00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:19,460
in the free software world and that

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,680
that's really good it's not it's not

00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,600
everything because I want to move on to

00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,280
the proprietary games as well which I

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,310
know some people don't want to play and

00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,740
that's completely fine as well but I

00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:33,590
mean I'm a big gamer and play lots of

00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,720
proprietary games as well as much as I

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,670
enjoy the Freestyle said this is a game

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,780
called a screenshot from a gun called

00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:44,120
and Detroit to become human it used to

00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,190
be a PlayStation 4 exclusive up in the

00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,970
last year and then they went through

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:51,380
lots of work to 42 windows and I first

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,210
saw this last year at the friend's house

00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,650
on a Playstation 4 and I was just an

00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,560
annoyed by the detail of all the

00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:01,570
graphics in artwork and just how smooth

00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:05,420
my electrons on the PlayStation and

00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,860
earlier this year I saw it was was

00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,530
ported to Windows

00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,660
and there's the next gaming website with

00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:14,000
claims that you can just run it on the

00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:16,730
Nexen it will just work him I thought I

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,400
was skeptical about this dad I did the

00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:22,130
demo version initially eventually bought

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,920
the full game but the demo just ran

00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:29,270
flawlessly it was so easy to install and

00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,860
it's did let me just clarify and this is

00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,630
not a Linux version of the game this was

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,670
the Windows version of the game that ran

00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:37,730
on Debian and it was so smooth and the

00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:42,290
best of all it was just a few clicks to

00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:44,570
install it it took me about a minute and

00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:46,309
half of clicks and then another few

00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,559
minutes of download went by and then I

00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:53,360
could play the game it was fantastic and

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:56,840
it's smooth no bugs or artifacts and it

00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,380
just worked so it's really great so how

00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,049
did get that easy because I mean with

00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,540
most fancy proprietary games from that

00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:10,340
comes from Windows you have to tweak

00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:13,160
wine and make up some DLL settings and

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:17,210
do a bunch of other things and it's not

00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,850
really quite easy so this is where the

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,740
tool called Lucas comes in they

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,890
basically make a bunch of recipes for

00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:28,160
games manage the tweaks that you have to

00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:30,200
do and then you can install game into it

00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,669
it's coming to its own unique wine

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:38,600
bottle and this works really well so for

00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:40,580
games from Windows you you just select

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,070
the recipe from the website there the

00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:46,520
URL handler that will open a new tree

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,200
steps on your Debian desktop and from

00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:52,160
there takes care of the rest it'll set

00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,710
up its own content environment I would

00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,690
even consider sandboxing all of this

00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,520
even a lot further as far as you can

00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,190
because you never know what proprietary

00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:05,000
games and stuff do you maybe even have a

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:05,360
dedicated computer for that but it works

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,190
great

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,049
I've been playing lots of different

00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:12,500
games and trying them out and it just

00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:16,520
looks completely fine Lucas is currently

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,620
in new the person who's maintaining that

00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,570
and apply the detainee is called Stefan

00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:23,149
listening he's also been helping me

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:26,470
with the next slide that I'm going to

00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:30,799
talk about it's called game mode now

00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:33,799
this concept of fist so in Windows when

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:36,259
you lied again full screen in Windows it

00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:38,779
gets what it's what's called game modes

00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:40,490
of notifications make sure your

00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:41,840
performance governance a to the right

00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,639
one I don't I what it's called in the

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,309
Windows kernel but make sure your

00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:46,970
computer uses all the resources it can

00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:49,070
for you again

00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,980
what's the prioritizes a process the

00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,090
prioritizes everything else just sets up

00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,500
your environment so that your game

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:59,559
already as good as possible and you

00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:02,360
don't get any annoyances so there's this

00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:05,389
company called Fuhrer interactive they

00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:08,450
made a game mode for Linux as well and

00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:10,310
it it does a bunch of things there I've

00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:12,589
it on my side

00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:15,109
it has optimization and shooting for CPU

00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:17,020
government governor I apriority

00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:20,089
press niceness cannot schedule a

00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:22,819
screensaver in editing a GPU performance

00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:26,119
mode GPU is a big thing on Linux because

00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:28,849
by default it just always uses low power

00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:31,089
mode even when you're working it hard so

00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:34,190
this makes sure that it uses the right

00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:36,010
and CPU governments notice while you're

00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,710
running again and it's it's back to

00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:43,040
default of the after you finish your

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:45,260
game so some games know about game mode

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,760
and will automatically invoke it when

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:52,550
you random and some of them you have to

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,260
invoke it manually there's also a clam

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,960
shell extension that I maintain in

00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:59,630
Debian that will show you when game mode

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,400
is active and if you check the package

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,990
description for game mode there's also a

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:08,240
way to test that it's working on your

00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:10,250
system so there's ways that the Debian

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,480
is getting better like some of these

00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:15,319
things that I mentioned in the last

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:18,020
asides that's making it easy to load an

00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:20,900
ever increasingly large amount of both

00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:24,890
free games and if you have a huge

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:28,720
library of odds proprietary games that

00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:32,960
just gets better and better but in Apple

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,859
and on max at least there's a few things

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,599
that I have

00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:40,640
they're trying to abandon 32bit on on

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,380
Mac OS which is kind of probably good

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,920
and a bad thing but one of the victims

00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,339
games this running old all the games on

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,009
Macs

00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:51,470
she's becoming kind of difficult and

00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:53,799
there's been lots of 32-bit games that

00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:56,720
have been released even up until

00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:59,829
relatively recently but another big hit

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,589
that Apple had about a month ago is that

00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:06,230
valve has advanced that steamvr will no

00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:09,589
longer work on mac OS and this is quite

00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:12,019
a big chunk of the virtual reality user

00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:14,630
base and that announced that they're

00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:17,900
only going to work on Linux and Windows

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:19,279
from now and then focus day so well

00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,009
things are getting better and Debian

00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:25,700
it's also getting a little bit worse on

00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:27,950
other platforms so I think for Gedman is

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:33,799
debian is emerging as a good safe place

00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:35,720
to run and keep a big your big library

00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:37,700
of games because usually when something

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,319
runs it more or less keeps on running I

00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,329
think we're a compatibility for all

00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:44,539
games have become better than it is on

00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:48,380
Windows and and Mac and it's getting to

00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:50,239
a point where you could say Windows is

00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,400
better if certain things are you or your

00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,039
priority and Linux is better if certain

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,630
other things are your priority but it's

00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,069
now it's no longer the wash it was

00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:01,460
before I think in the past

00:36:58,069 --> 00:37:03,259
gaming on nxy was kind of no this

00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,630
doesn't work it's not a good idea and

00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:07,339
most serious gamers wouldn't consider it

00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:09,619
and you see more and more gaming

00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:12,559
websites talk about Linux and getting

00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:14,989
excited about it and getting Windows

00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:17,119
users to at least do boots there there's

00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:19,249
so many kids out there that do boots

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,220
just to get an extra three or four

00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:24,589
frames a second in their game and for

00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,809
them this is enough reason to do boot

00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:28,579
and reboot every time they use it

00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:32,119
another game just for those extra few

00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:32,660
friends and there's some songs for them

00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,759
too

00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:39,489
to get involved in Debian to eventually

00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:45,680
I think and and that takes me to my next

00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:48,049
slide sides actually because Debian is

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,329
not any grinding to a great

00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:52,369
distribution for playing games but it's

00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:55,670
a fantastic platform for making games

00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:59,150
all the packages we include really offer

00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:01,549
an extensive and impressive array of

00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,089
tools that you can use to create your

00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:04,489
games

00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:09,559
so instead finally finding the released

00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:12,799
version one there in Skype Victor

00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:14,450
growing program this month and I think

00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:16,279
that's really good news and even more

00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:20,239
fantastically it's already even back

00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:23,180
ported to busted back ports so if that's

00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:26,089
not excellent I don't know what is but

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,650
in scope is an old staple of the free

00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:29,900
software drawing stack so I'm actually

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,450
glad that they finally finally released

00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,579
version once

00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,029
congratulations do then and then is

00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,369
critter

00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:40,099
also another app that now as a

00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:46,549
foundation behind them and lots of

00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:48,589
momentum they and they also have huge

00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:51,609
traction of game designers with it's

00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:55,519
free or proprietary game designers and

00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:59,960
lots of good documentation and training

00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:02,420
videos on their site then there is also

00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,940
a gaming engine that I learned about

00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,920
I've read about in previously but I

00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,950
learned a lot about them during first in

00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:13,460
this year and they're called Godot Godot

00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:15,319
it's a free 3d and 2d game design studio

00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:19,670
engine run time that lets you create

00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:21,979
really fancy games and and I guess what

00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,930
all of that is packaged and ready in

00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:25,819
Debian - including its runtime so if you

00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:28,549
want to write games for Debian with

00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:30,079
Godot and getting them packaged and

00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:33,789
actually accepting Debian if there are

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:36,529
free software is quite easy so I think

00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:40,880
this platform is going to do big things

00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:42,890
and allow lots of not only proprietary

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,859
game developers but people who want to

00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:51,079
make good free games flourish and do

00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:53,119
fantastic things so I'd also love it if

00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,069
we could have another online mini did

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,269
come in the future that's focused on

00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:58,269
gaming so

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,070
maybe half of it focused on the games

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,500
and exploring them how to run them how

00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,570
to what's good and what you can do and

00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,240
how it compares to other systems and

00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:13,330
maybe have another half of mini they've

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,420
gone for developing games where we get

00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:18,580
that streams like Godot and Inkscape and

00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,640
critter and there's so many others as

00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:23,830
well that could talk on how to use those

00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,650
tools and how they're good for gaming

00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:29,770
and and so and maybe we could make it to

00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:32,560
more of a tutorial weekend in some ways

00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:34,560
as well and that way we get some more

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,390
new people and maybe even younger people

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,390
interested and excited about Debian but

00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,680
overall I think in terms of excellence

00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:43,510
therein is really amazing it's a great

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,050
game platform both for running and

00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:49,000
creating it and the same way we are for

00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:51,040
for servers and there's other areas

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,900
that's that this is acting in as well

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,110
but I think people aren't always as

00:40:52,900 --> 00:41:00,520
we're how good is becoming a getting

00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:01,240
like platform then then it is as wanted

00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,440
to shed some light

00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:07,900
unless that in this talk and on the

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,740
topic of since I mentioned mini did mean

00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:13,960
DEFCON and now we all like to sit in

00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,990
front of the computers a lot but at the

00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,120
same time getting together we are social

00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,620
creatures and humans like getting

00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,340
together with other people and as we've

00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:26,290
learned in this weekend to doing things

00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:28,330
like a mini debconf in real life is just

00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:30,490
so much easier and many ways more

00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:34,180
convenient but if we can't have that

00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:40,440
then something like a mini debconf

00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:43,690
online is a good second choice and I

00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:49,060
think it can also supplement minded

00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:50,620
confidence with things like a themed

00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:53,140
ones like the gaming weekend which might

00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:56,080
be a bit more difficult to do in in real

00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:58,900
life so this photo was taken last year

00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,900
after Deb Kahn's 19 was a group photo at

00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:04,930
the BBQ and he was probably whatever

00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:08,300
lost get togethers we've had before

00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:13,070
lockdown started everywhere this was

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:15,830
the fuzz damn Minnie Deb camp that

00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,350
happened before the first any event so

00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:20,480
hopefully we will have these not too far

00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:23,150
in the distant future again but I do

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,190
hope that a nine-minute that kind of

00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,050
idea will continue to evolve and grow

00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,060
and get better with time as well and

00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:34,910
with that I think I have time for at

00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:38,780
least one question yeah so there are two

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:41,930
questions so far the first one was who

00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:44,990
can decide about stopping a request for

00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:48,980
adoption or cleaning things we can

00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:51,950
decide I think anyone what kind of

00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,810
decision is needed there and I mean stop

00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:56,180
what is stopping a request for adoption

00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:59,480
mean I think it's in terms of you were

00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,640
talking about closing RFA's and filing

00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,300
our inbox I think if it gets that all

00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:10,010
just do it I mean if if if a packet is a

00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:11,690
food option for more than two years if

00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,420
someone really going to care if you

00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,830
close the RFA and file an errand for the

00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,720
bug and explaining why you're doing it I

00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,700
don't think it will be a problem I think

00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:23,870
people can just go ahead and probably

00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:26,150
should go ahead and do that the second

00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:27,950
question was would it be possible to

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:30,020
have an online learning platform within

00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,630
the Debian project something like Linux

00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,280
Academy say there be an Academy for

00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:37,760
people who want to teach and do official

00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,380
courses on any Debian related topic was

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,570
that the tournament ask Beth my namesake

00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,200
I think he I think that was probably him

00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:46,250
because we were talking about this Oh

00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,740
previously yeah I think that is a good

00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:50,750
idea it's a good idea it's just getting

00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:53,750
it off the ground will is a lot of work

00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:56,900
and maybe we can start small and build a

00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,670
net having sessions like this way people

00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,530
teach and other people can watch in

00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,540
there and interact with might be a good

00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,830
start

00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:07,240
if you're talking about academies I

00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:09,410
guess you care about certification and

00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:13,670
things like that as well which might be

00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:15,170
a lot more complicated but I think if

00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,060
you have a big idea like that it's

00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:19,190
usually a good idea to figure out how to

00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,340
start small and then gradually build on

00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,340
that

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,530
okay I haven't seen any more questions

00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:30,920
from IRC but we can just hang on a bit

00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,920
for those

00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:10,720
I think we're just about running out of

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:13,710
time as well yeah okay well thank you

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,710
