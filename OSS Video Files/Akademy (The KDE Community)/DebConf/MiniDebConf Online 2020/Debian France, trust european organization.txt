about you didn't force lot perfect

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,740
organizational perfect organization

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,380
first of all everything sorry but I'm

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,060
not I don't have those slides because I

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,860
didn't have the time to to be helped to

00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,380
do that and though it was so difficult

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,160
for me to prepare that but we're going

00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:51,900
to try yeah our Becky and thank you very

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:54,960
much for his help to send the most

00:00:51,900 --> 00:01:00,060
important information we would like

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,460
maybe to see to see written well dig in

00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,070
France when I wanted to talk about that

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,890
to you because it's an important

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,899
organization for Debian because as

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,619
everything everyone loves of course

00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:17,249
Debian he has not any any existence

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,079
because as was said during the DPL

00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:23,310
election she's not it's not a

00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:27,840
foundations organization so it's it

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,630
leaves yeah yeah it's it's trust

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,350
organizations and in Europe League and

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:37,409
France is the organization which is able

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,460
to represent Debian and so I think it

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,649
was important to its importance to

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,499
introduce for for the project this

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,170
organization will say that you you know

00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:54,990
it's and you know what it doesn't under

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:58,709
what how it works so the gun Frances had

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:02,100
been created in 2006 by developers but

00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:04,770
by Debian developers and she's this

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,100
organization is submitting to the French

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,410
low of 19:1

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:13,379
allow which is the note for the low

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:17,319
profit organizations so it's it's a pure

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:21,069
super organization of the

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:25,280
of this little structure we have about

00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:29,780
90 members mainly French members of

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,870
course because we made me move in France

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,980
during the events that I will talk about

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,890
in a few minutes

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,260
about 90 members a lot of Debian

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:45,410
developers I will explain that in a few

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:48,610
seconds and we all the people who are

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:54,530
members are so Debbie interpreters and

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:58,160
pay for the organization 10 euros each

00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:00,100
year true to remember of the

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,160
organization to get involved in a we're

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:07,130
internal working under votes to elect

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,420
the board and to elect the President to

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:16,280
elect shops and 90 persons are able to

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:21,230
do that on the board we have nine

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:25,000
persons most stable Debian developers so

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,590
I will try show you the mix of the

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,420
Debian developers who are members of the

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:39,230
of the board seven members so developers

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:41,739
and others are not in elected president

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,940
of course I'm the president of the

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:48,319
Libyan horse organization

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:51,230
I'm Debian developer not uploading so I

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,569
mainly work for translation for

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:57,769
accessibility for community team and so

00:03:53,569 --> 00:04:00,709
also for this organization and also the

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,750
board elected a person to to the

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:10,750
treasurer of course so it's the pepper

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:10,750
PE beets as you see all the red and

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:23,539
there are several persons the budget of

00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:25,729
the two two persons sorry the budget of

00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:29,630
the organization be investor and key

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:31,660
animals with not a table developer and

00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:37,400
[Applause]

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:59,570
you have about treasure well sorry I

00:04:37,400 --> 00:05:09,139
lost my window well is to know what

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:13,880
Debian trolls does I would say that this

00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:17,510
organization represents division and at

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:22,990
least also on the French area but also

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:24,979
in Europe I mean for example we

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,770
currently with results

00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:30,979
Debian at fault at first them in

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:37,300
particular when we are present on the

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:40,760
boost at even European events we also

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,710
are in friendship England's events such

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:47,030
as for example the light software

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:48,460
meeting with organized each year for for

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:56,450
some time because there were not enough

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:58,300
persons but a few years ago also capital

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,370
de Lima in Jerusalem

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,250
so such events are very important with a

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:08,169
lot of people a lot of billion users and

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,050
live in developers that we can meet and

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:13,700
events for example on Park puppies

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,070
passes on set for example where we we

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,440
have also the opportunity to meet new

00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:26,690
users new dependable personal

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:29,630
contributors contact points this the

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:33,490
fact that we we we really are present on

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:37,370
the French church air area

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:41,349
enables that we are a kind of contact

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,599
point for beginner to to come in Libyan

00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:45,270
first

00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:49,740
on the booth people are very happy with

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:52,399
meeting legal developers which we are in

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,459
real life so we are very happy and we

00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,349
have some mailing also enabled to the

00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:01,379
beginners to have a first contact to the

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:03,629
distribution and first help to start

00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,659
contributing and to start using the

00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:09,659
distribution some person discovered

00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:13,349
again by our prisons via our prisons and

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:18,270
so it's very important for us and why it

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:19,619
happens that request our help - - - to

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,449
get involved in the project for example

00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:26,490
we have a contacted to support the

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:30,209
development hackathon we requested to

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:34,589
help that and we did of course because

00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:38,969
again we represent stadium we also

00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:41,909
organise meetups it's some very short

00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:44,669
events some evenings after works in

00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:48,659
particular in pints but also in tourism

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:52,019
in the South of France also we organize

00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:55,559
that and so in Europe just like I said

00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:56,879
we try to build the boost of Debian all

00:07:55,559 --> 00:08:00,899
the weekends

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:05,550
among other persons to - to promote - to

00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:12,300
sell goodies for Debian we also try to

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:16,019
make internal community life active in

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:19,800
particular through IBM Kampf we organize

00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:22,409
the mini debconf in 2019 and we hope to

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,519
have a new one in 2020 in October if

00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:28,949
things are possible according to the

00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:31,979
context of course you imagine it's a

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:34,649
very important time because European the

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,130
main contributors meet each other of

00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:38,339
course

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:41,880
many Europeans but it's not absolutely

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:44,339
mandatory and so it's a it's an

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,439
opportunity to meet people who helps go

00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,839
to the dead code because it's so far for

00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:51,000
example or you're in the wrong period

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,089
they can go to this kind of events on

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,360
the meet each other in real life also we

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,950
have another box crashing parties

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:04,020
again so it's an even cheaper turn to

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:06,270
have a community alive and also we

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,980
support the action of the VN in

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:13,470
particularly in Europe of course we

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,100
could represent a beyond just like SPI

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:24,870
does at the USA we could represent a vm

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:26,820
if something was necessary in the other

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,650
thing is we're actually getting funds

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,130
for Debian because it's also a part of

00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:36,150
our action in parallel and during we we

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:40,520
are on the boost I would say that on

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:44,310
Debian boots with sell goodies and it's

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:47,339
it works very very very good very fine

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,510
finally we when we see what happens at

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:54,690
first them goodies are sold very quickly

00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:56,970
and we get donations on every booth in

00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:01,440
France or in Europe we get the nation's

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:04,800
and these donations from Debian events

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,050
in general events are in our budget and

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,190
then in the Debian budgets that I will

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:15,900
explain in a few minutes it rivers to

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:17,339
friends our own needs of course for

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,920
example to to to help

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,890
Volodya to tribal or to do things like

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,580
that but also to help to defend the

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:29,960
legal budget directly the Debian funds

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:33,480
for example those events for example or

00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:37,440
for media or for example it's fended

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,510
from our own budget but we could imagine

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,800
that they will could refine something

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:47,670
and the event force could help and could

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:50,100
support the funding of a project the

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:53,580
Libyan funds with the authorization of

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:58,070
course of the DPN so we have two budgets

00:10:53,580 --> 00:11:01,020
to handle one for Debian

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:04,800
so it's under the DPI approval of course

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:08,850
and one is for the

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,519
our own working and working teleworking

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,459
and it's a kind of how we balance all

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,769
that and most of our friends go to to

00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,170
the Debian budgets at the end of the

00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:24,509
year when we have to reduce the current

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:29,279
ability how we support the actions with

00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:32,029
them we use that also to support to

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,980
support of course they will even's I

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:37,740
would say that today when we are in ask

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,199
for example many deaf goof-goof

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:47,550
are supported by our internal budgets

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:50,370
and by sponsors they can find and also I

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:53,190
think so that we could request also

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,170
didn't budgets approval of the DPL to be

00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,899
true to help those we need approve to be

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:05,339
organized so it's a lot of part of the

00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:11,120
of the activity the thing I can tell you

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:16,220
as well is that as we have two budgets

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:21,089
one for Debian itself and one for

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:24,360
working we also can support all the

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:28,199
things I'm given only I mean for example

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,600
we are members of some free software not

00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:35,310
perfect organizations I mean for example

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:38,490
a pillar which is in France kind of

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:41,029
official definition in force and maybe

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,110
we can meet the members of other

00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:45,959
organizations in the future for example

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:49,259
for persons for organizations which

00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:51,839
defends the freedom of the of the

00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:59,279
internet also neutrality of the of the

00:12:51,839 --> 00:13:03,870
Internet of course question is how we

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:06,149
need help of course because as any

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,899
nonprofit organization we are very very

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,199
small

00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:13,470
despite the despite I just settled on

00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:16,769
what we do the first thing of course if

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:20,339
anyone can candidates in route to to

00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:22,630
have a tax low and also its neighbors to

00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,240
to friends the division budget so

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:29,050
it's always a good thing but also you

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,930
know we have about 100 Debian developers

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,690
in France or speaking French or in

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:37,090
France at least it's true and more I

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:41,020
think if we if we go to the French

00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:44,680
speakers so this French Debian

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:48,580
developers can also join us of course to

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,680
help us on booth because being on the

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,960
booth during all the weekend may be very

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,090
very long so it's always useful if we

00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,670
have people to help

00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:01,690
so during events we always need people

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:05,080
to talk to to be on the boost to help to

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:07,540
organize only what sees around the booth

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,510
because there is all the question of

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,070
transports the question of of transports

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,740
the goodies at the trustor it's all

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,980
something which is very well done

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:22,210
there's a current team but some help

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:25,030
would be of course an excellent ivy and

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:29,200
also because you know of course there is

00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:31,600
a board a board where our Constitution

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,150
they'd be a no-cost Constitution since

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,320
that on the board there is a minimum

00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:42,370
number of Debian developers which needed

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:46,720
to to hover to be acceptable so of

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:49,600
course any person who would like to join

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,630
us in the board will be an excellent ID

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:57,670
because of course rinrin is always very

00:14:52,630 --> 00:15:00,610
difficult as you know I know that before

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,220
the current board there was some

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:06,550
problems too for example to have someone

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,250
who's a secretary posts so it's always

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,890
very useful to to have some persons and

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,470
some presidents who are ready to give a

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:17,890
little time to help to manage the

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:22,360
organization as administrator and as a

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:24,610
member of the board also many other

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,930
contributors may be may be useful of

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,680
course even if we're not aware of that

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,470
immediately but there are a lot of

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,770
things which can be dieudonné for

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:40,720
example the websites for example

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:43,360
the management of the mailing list well

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,350
there are a lot of things to do that

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,700
anyway would be will be very useful to

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:54,580
reduce I just need you to finish the

00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,060
much quicker than I I think it's a good

00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,150
thing

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,580
IIIi have um I was afraid to to have

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:03,730
problems due to my English but suddenly

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:11,500
it's more quick quicker than I've found

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:14,920
I will give you the URL of websites it's

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,370
in French of course but maybe it will

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:22,900
may give you some information about our

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:26,790
current events and about general

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:30,790
organization and what we are doing so

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:33,430
well it's it's great for me

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:38,050
the event also tries to represent Debian

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:41,290
and we hope that we also will help

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:44,740
beginners to come in contributes and use

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,840
of course Debian and we have a success

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:51,400
doing that because for example our Puran

00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:53,350
secretary zodac comes from a meter so

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,260
it's well organizing in May tab that we

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,230
have someone which we came and we mount

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,570
a Libyan developer alert uploading and

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,790
translator I'm also a member of the of

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,550
the big insurance organization so well

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:10,410
it's very very important for us to do

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:14,230
all that and we hope to have all that

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:16,650
get some new contributors for Olivia

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,650
thank you

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:33,650
so I don't know how you do about

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:42,620
questions I see an Irish say at least

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:45,200
one question well I see one question for

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,390
examples from Frederick totally day to

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,650
ask new questions if you want I can't

00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:54,230
start reading RC now about a freight

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,030
organization actually I don't know it's

00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:00,530
something which needs to be decided by

00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:04,370
the General Assembly it would imply of

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:06,440
course statutes Constitution changes to

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:09,350
have a full flat organization where

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,510
everybody is presidents as you propose

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,790
the Frederick

00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:18,680
so it's something which should be

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:22,160
discussed anyway personally I don't like

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,710
this kind organization and I have to say

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,770
that every any organization where I use

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:30,620
so such such things has problems to work

00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:33,920
except Debian community but for reasons

00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:38,690
it's because there are some well a kind

00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:41,690
of common trim which enables to work

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:44,510
together even if we even if we don't

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:48,820
agree all the time but it's form state

00:18:44,510 --> 00:19:01,700
organization it's difficult way of

00:18:48,820 --> 00:19:05,840
working so should be discussed with the

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:09,200
swag shop be open as the sweatshop is

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,510
open so from your information there is a

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:20,260
websites where you can buy some

00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:23,750
different goodies all the year although

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:32,120
I will write I think it will be simple

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:36,980
for you if I find like this website is

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:38,960
in French but also in English and on

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,230
these websites you can find goodies for

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,280
them

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:46,250
and that are provided by your but I

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,530
didn't transfer so forcibly beyond and

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,950
as I said to deviant friends because

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:54,169
most of our friends are given to the

00:19:51,950 --> 00:20:00,890
Debian organist project at the end

00:19:54,169 --> 00:20:05,240
anyway I members from other territory

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:07,669
welcome I would say yes there is not any

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:12,200
criteria the question is from ours and

00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:16,580
us and I would I would say I'm sorry

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:19,929
thank you John back for the fix which

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,929
was not good I'm sorry

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:28,370
[Music]

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:31,370
so there was not any creature we are to

00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:35,720
accept people from other territories the

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:40,870
only important thing so far but well so

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:47,270
far is that we mainly speak in French

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:49,190
today we're speaking French so it's a

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,660
critical maybe important because it

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,700
probably would be somewhat more

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:59,299
difficult if we should but why not just

00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:03,020
finger we think about the other thing is

00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:07,340
that the only thing actually because

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:09,650
once once we learn that we have this

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,710
question of language I don't think there

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:28,280
was so problem to accept from from

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:30,440
anyone any contribution yeah

00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:34,220
sticking thinking French would help of

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:39,350
course or many we could also imagine a

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:41,660
dual language persons recruit for

00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:45,850
example translate some some different

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:49,130
false reports into into into English

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:51,080
language so well probably probably

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,029
interesting I think also to to have this

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,459
third but so far that's right

00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:57,469
the organization is especially known in

00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:58,849
France and that's also a reason from

00:21:57,469 --> 00:22:01,219
which I wanted to talk about it in a

00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:03,739
minute DEFCON because I think it's

00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:10,639
important for the project to to a

00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:13,339
village it's but well so of course so

00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:15,979
far we don't have any not French speaker

00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:18,649
member but for example at meaning that

00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:21,439
both when we organized through

00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:23,659
Marseilles it was truly international so

00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:26,959
we have people from any countries from

00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:29,569
Spain from Germany from her from Great

00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:31,849
Britain so it's not that cold I'm also

00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:34,219
from the from the white world it would

00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:37,969
be it would be possible I think actually

00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:42,949
there is not any any anything to to

00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:50,959
propose that are there any further

00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:58,909
questions could be more inclusive I'm

00:22:50,959 --> 00:23:01,279
sure I agree the right Sahra suggest

00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:04,189
that we should talk about the B&O fund

00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:08,719
rather instead of the bill of France

00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:11,709
that's right well I guess the name was

00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:13,789
chosen by the original fenders and

00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:15,679
that's up for publicity

00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:21,049
it's thought about this this thing but

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:25,209
yeah any French speaker would be would

00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,209
be welcome of course without any problem

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:36,879
maybe - for what also URL to people

00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:41,329
which moosari would like to do some

00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:46,179
donation so I would do that also sorry I

00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:51,499
have to get him to copy and paste this

00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:54,189
and we did see my computer is somewhat

00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:57,259
slower than usual

00:23:54,189 --> 00:24:00,439
oops and I saw a further question that I

00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:02,979
will try once we're through these few

00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,979
seconds

00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:18,070
so so further questions any contacts

00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,500
from other french-speaking groups like

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:31,230
Quebec or Africa

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:35,200
so fondled store fights lots well at

00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,940
FOSDEM we had the opportunity to meet

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,950
each other with the video team where

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,260
there is Louie Philip which is member of

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,450
the video team and who came through

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,150
first them and we came up us with that

00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,190
from the booth so it was very nice to

00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:51,550
meet him

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:56,860
so we also may probably indeed work with

00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:59,770
Quebec Quebec you guys so far that I was

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:05,260
in contact and the precise contact but

00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:07,450
why not we could we could do also where

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:12,010
is the second organization in friends

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:15,130
will gather some Debian users it's

00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:18,400
really the idea of helping supporting

00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:20,890
user supports between Debian users but

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,710
also they give contributions to do some

00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:28,460
wiki for example it's Debian fastener

00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:31,170
and we try to write that also for unions

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:35,500

00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:41,080
we try to work with this author low

00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:44,770
profit organization or so because it's

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:48,400
very it's very important for us to to

00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:52,690
try to have a kind of ecosystem around

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,480
Debian because it's important to users

00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:57,970
and developers to love each other and to

00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,490
be able to do in real life for meetings

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:05,230
and to to see each other it's very

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:07,750
helpful I think because well neighbors -

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,630
did Divya - - to be a welcoming

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,390
community I take a simple example it's

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:17,350
my own example I'm using Libyan on

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:21,059
helping Libya for truth since 2004

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:25,179
but I started to contribute to the

00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:28,539
translation team once I met a once I met

00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:29,130
Arthur back because sonic explained to

00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:32,230
me

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,120
speaking all the process of how it works

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,850
and how things are done and it's

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,820
sometimes much easier than reading some

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:42,100
hype documentation or I pages so I

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:46,860
probably wouldn't have contributed to

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:52,600
this team without this I am meeting also

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:56,320
I the same thing in Jerusalem in Libyan

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,299
events I was introduced by your someone

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,970
sometimes I I could become easily a

00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:02,460
Libyan developer not a powder and it was

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,169
important for the Libyan the first

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:09,070
organization so I did the process I

00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:11,620
didn't do that for for the time I I

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:14,289
started contributing to Debian so it

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:16,779
really shows that this kind of meeting

00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:20,500
this kind of human relationship that

00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:23,259
created by having an organization to to

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,500
do events is very it's very very

00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:32,860
important so so it's it's very very

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:37,480
important I think thanks so like I will

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:39,879
give you the URL until Debian facili at

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,980
least it will be probably more simple to

00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:45,190
find even if I think it's only in French

00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:47,190
but at least you will know that that

00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,520
exists

00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:55,110
[Music]

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:57,540
yeah last Canadian boost at first I miss

00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:01,470
collaborative of course that's right dig

00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,940
in France is presence and sounds not

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:07,500
goodies but of course there are other

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:10,200
persons who come and who help booth for

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,830
example we had to the video team members

00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:18,000
who came and helped on the booth so so

00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:31,100
it's a collaborative booth everything in

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:35,820
Debian other any other questions well

00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:38,730
anyway I for your information I we had

00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:42,240
many lists where you can maybe I can

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:46,740
give you that we have many lists where

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,290
you can take information in French

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:53,990
[Music]

00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:56,570
because you have the website question

00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:01,140
will they be any friends be at for them

00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:05,910
2021 if any yes we will be of course are

00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,270
you talking about it yet what's your

00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,790
question

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,110
I don't know what you mean yes will be

00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,840
present of course if there are first

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:16,230
name will be present at least in general

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:27,030
there is five or six persons from Libyan

00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:29,340
profs so yes we will be present and also

00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:32,760
will be present at Capitol deliver if

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:36,870
there is the oneness and as I said there

00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:39,630
is probably immediate about October that

00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:44,070
it was announced during last minute

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:46,740
epoch of Abbas say in 2019 it wasn't

00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:50,910
done because organizing was very

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:54,270
difficult but yeah we are going to to to

00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:59,150
to do it I was worrying about the post

00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:59,150
copied rose yeah

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,989
the post common of course

00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:10,529
so know that in France wealth

00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:13,649
seemed to be somewhat less less

00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:17,190
difficult than they were in the next

00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:21,479
week's we are going to be able to tribal

00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:23,639
in France and the tabs will open the

00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:26,940
restaurants we often hostile will open

00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:32,639
so well real seems to be somewhat less

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:36,330
less shown it stupid that in Europe the

00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:42,539
fan tires will open during the next

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:49,109
month so well we can hope that when

00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:54,089
first time we the problem of Kebede we

00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:57,509
hope at least we really hope if we will

00:30:54,089 --> 00:31:01,469
be compliance with the rats which will

00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:06,299
be people by forum organized errs and by

00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:09,839
the altar which offers to talk to me to

00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:12,889
be sure that volunteers and all the

00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:20,399
persons coming on the booth are in

00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:21,899
complete safety so but I'm what - today

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:27,119
I'm optimistic

00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:29,159
I really hope we'll be with the good in

00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,070
next month and so for them will take

00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:34,649
place mini that comes will take place

00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:38,580
but of course I'm aware that it's not

00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:45,599
exactly what the decision is not human

00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:48,029
dependence so well wait and see other of

00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:58,349
our questions or is it good for you I'm

00:31:48,029 --> 00:32:01,320

00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:21,880
if you want to get information or to get

00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:25,549
an exchange about about Debian France

00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,130
and I'm not sure I Prasad I said I I

00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:29,240
