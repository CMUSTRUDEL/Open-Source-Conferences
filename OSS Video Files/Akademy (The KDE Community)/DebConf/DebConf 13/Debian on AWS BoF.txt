yeah James bromberger who already

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,059
yesterday talked about how AWS can help

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,030
Debian will now talk about Debian on AWS

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,130
and yeah thank you cool

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,389
so I'm firstly this is the buff session

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,310
so that's why I said everyone come

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,890
forward and we'll try and just discuss

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,750
because basically so far I've obviously

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,160
grabbed ingresses script and we've been

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,330
generating a.m. eyes and we've been

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,939
keeping it as base but there's been a

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,140
couple of ideas that have come up a few

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,630
of these we've discussed on the mailing

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,160
list on the Debian cloud list but it'd

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,390
be great to get some feedback in the

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,820
room and some ideas back in there and

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,070
because we don't have an official cloud

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,570
team on Debian it's kind of this we are

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,329
the cloud team thank you you've come

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,350
along you're in the group so I had a bit

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,059
of an agenda that I wanted to go through

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,920
a quick summary of the current status of

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,930
the a.m. eyes on on eight of us and

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,460
obviously my talk now I'm actually

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,379
talking as a Debian developer not as an

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,590
address person I'm completely above the

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,780
hypervisor here lifecycle management of

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,910
those am eyes I deprecated a couple of

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,280
the old dumb squeeze or this old squeeze

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,460
released six oh six about two three

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,750
weeks ago the additions that we've got

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,979
on there hopefully there's a base image

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,520
right now security and then any other

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:14,189
items that come up sound cool general

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,710
nodding cool so um

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,509
current status we have base Debian am

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,920
eyes in all regions and including gov

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,299
cloud so I've managed to find someone

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,509
who was good enough from kind enough to

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,820
sponsor us taking that image into the

00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:28,130
ITAR restricted gov cloud environment

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,630
obviously I can't push that there myself

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,960
I'm I don't have access not being a US

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,390
citizen and and I guess Jimmy would you

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,420
like to push the game I yeah yeah yeah

00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,180
politics it only contains Debian main

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,700
packages plus the SS SSH root resize

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,509
user data execute scripts in the root

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,149
filesystem

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,220
oh yeah said that but no cloud in it so

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,750
we all know this issue right now and we

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,950
have that question around where the

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,719
cloud and it should be pulled in from

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,100
back ports and if we do that whether or

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,390
not that means we should have back ports

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:06,899
in apt sources or app sources lists or D

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,789
by default we're configured for HBO via

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,470
net we're not doing a full back to a

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,000
cloud front or Debian don't net but H

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,800
Peter Damian don't net for most regions

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,990
is actually pointing at

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,700
front so it's a zero-sum game and if we

00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,220
as Debian want to ever not use cloud

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,600
front for the CD enter to access

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,110
packages then we obviously can change

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,880
that outside of AWS we also don't have

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,580
any of the software development kits so

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,380
the libraries boko that although boto is

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,430
in there it's a actually reasonably

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,850
up-to-date I think there's somebody up

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:41,760
today we've now also got SDKs for nodejs

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:44,100
for Java for Ruby I think there's about

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,960
six or seven SDKs that are available

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,340
I think boto may be one of the few ones

00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,130
that on there there's some older Perl

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,750
libraries on there some older client

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:57,690
tools in fact s3 CMD I think might have

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,610
a bug in it that I was persisting to the

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,560
maintainer saying we need this sort of

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,770
three line patch applied because it it's

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,270
gonna be an issue and so we've got a

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,960
bunch of questions as to what should

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:14,010
actually be in them so let's go through

00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:17,300
that what do you guys think about cloud

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,300
NIT how are we going to handle that

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:30,750
microphone not working but if we install

00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,830
it then we obviously need to maintain it

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,090
and we need to make sure that it's

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:41,700
correct for any security problems that

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:44,250
happen the back bolts yes so should we

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,050
package pin it to back ports says the

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,480
owner to pin it you just need to install

00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:52,320
it install it's going to be upgraded to

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,850
automatically if it's what if there's

00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:12,150
anything else in back ports that

00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:16,080
supersede what's in mine okay so from

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,519
backwards specifically cool so what do

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,489
we need for that just a nap sources line

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,630
and then in the install script we just

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:23,940
install back cloud in it

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,180
do we still consider that to be a Debian

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,180
image

00:04:27,740 --> 00:05:40,560
yeah yeah so we can do that for the next

00:04:35,930 --> 00:05:41,849
image and right now there are I think

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,529
the main question is whether Debian

00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:45,750
would be okay with having a cloud in it

00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,340
that has code in it that's not in the

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,969
upstream cloud in it and that might be

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,099
okay

00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:52,860
I should also clarify we'd be very happy

00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:56,180
for them to take the code but the

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,180
default license would of course be

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,740
packages and obviously take patches and

00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:17,659
be applied so deep patch on package

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:17,659
create so that's one option yeah okay

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,650
SDKs client tools etc now this becomes

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:26,310
an interesting one that obviously the

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:28,800
SDKs from all cloud providers updated

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,930
pretty regularly new features happen and

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,710
a lot of users want those features and I

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,110
think we were talking earlier about

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,659
things like being able to write a object

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,039
storage and stuff like that we have a

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:41,340
lot of Amazon tools already available

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,380
so I mentioned s3 CMD botos already

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,350
but do we want to be adding in

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,210
additional stuff from a vendor

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,660
repository into the Debian cloud images

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,040
my thoughts are potential but then it

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,480
would be significantly different from

00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:00,420
Debian because it's got vendor PPA for

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,660
one of a better expression over in that

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,220
base image not all obviously not all

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,920
instances that start on the cloud need

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,480
these tools but the fact they're

00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,840
installed and not used might not be an

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,850
issue

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:18,979
what do people here think so

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,979
[Music]

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,880
personally I'm happy with the images as

00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,240
they are but there are tools like for

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,970
example Glacia SDKs to talk to Amazon

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,450
some code storage that's not available

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:38,970
in in any of our a.m. eyes right now but

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,380
do we want that and this is the same

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,400
question you guys got with gists I would

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,360
show you that your customers are

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,979
probably crying for it but there's this

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,510
this two options though do we put into

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,700
the base image or do we make it trivial

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,960
for them to bootstrap to get to that

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,270
point that it's available we will you

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,190
put that in DBM main yes these tools

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,320
that were that I would like then do it

00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,790
in main uploaded to Sidon and after 10

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,660
days upload it to backwards and then

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,350
problem solved

00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,990
yeah so we got back what I did we

00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:17,370
channel everything through backwards

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:19,680
yeah that's the only way concurs but my

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,300
impression from the process is that if

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,520
you want to upgrade your to upgrade your

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,350
tools every couple months with new

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,120
features and functionality you have to

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,340
go to backwards we're now these tools I

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,760
think we should have in main standard

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,380
anyway because I know these SDKs are

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,530
useful for me but for my laptop it would

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,300
be oh yes that would be old I mean none

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,460
of us are going to deprecated our API at

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,530
a rate that the the tools that were

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,850
packaged you know three years ago I got

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,770
to stop working and not be useful to

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,150
some degree it might not have the latest

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,630
greatest thing that the customers are

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,840
going oh nice shiny toy we want that

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:58,690
okay

00:08:52,840 --> 00:09:02,220
cool cuts current set of a.m. eyes so we

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:06,040
currently have EB SMI 64-bit and 32-bit

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:09,460
para virtualization and we're going to

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,840
add s3 a.m. eyes as well I started work

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,700
on that about two weeks ago I hit

00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,190
something and didn't manage to get back

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,760
to it a couple of interesting questions

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:23,560
here should we drop 32-bit we have multi

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:31,660
arch yeah hey Dave back one I was one

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:33,580
second I'll be here all week we're

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,130
talking about earlier which was like how

00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,320
can we copy thing like it was the gcutil

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,540
problem can we copy code from other

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,430
packages and put it into our package is

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:47,620
that more acceptable in back ports than

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:49,030
it would be a main no yeah but but newer

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,180
versions of packages are by definition

00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:54,340
of back ports more acceptable as long as

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,010
you make sure that when you have back

00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:00,220
ports included things are relatively

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:02,710
coherent and working if you include back

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:09,520
ports and and you pay attention to

00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:10,960
security fixes yeah okay so back to the

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,100
32-bit question we have multi our

00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:22,270
support in wizzy is that good enough

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:28,030
that we don't need 32-bit images someone

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:31,480
has an opinion come on for many you

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,850
workload 64 bits is alright though if

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,890
you run Perl or PHP the problem is that

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:40,540
it takes twice the amount of memory yeah

00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:43,870
so for some PHP users such a tube it may

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:50,500
make sense though we have also coming

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:52,720
soon the x32 architecture which will be

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,880
a partial architecture and let my solve

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,050
the problem so you we would run in 64

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:02,680
bits together with some 32 bits usually

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:05,650
yeah which still has eight registers and

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,540
whatever in this so that's a chassis

00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,520
error problem so it's going to happen

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,330
but like when jesse is going to be

00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,700
released not before perfect and so what

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,160
I would do if I were you would be

00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,090
keeping such 2 bits for Debian and

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,650
shield we have Jesse and the x32

00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:37,030
Marshall architecture $0.10 well

00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:39,760
everyone agree yeah ok next one so EBS H

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,790
VM images so hardware virtualization

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,770
now if you saw my talk yesterday the API

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,900
for registering images from a block

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:52,360
device got updated so that now you can

00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:56,020
actually register H VM images no yeah

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,530
not anymore yeah there's a man who had

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,540
an NDA so uh no this is now going to be

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,670
open and available to be called from

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,940
tools now eucalyptus obviously in the

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:10,450
last 11 days hasn't implemented that yet

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,550
even the AWS ec2 tools haven't

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,100
implemented that parameter yet as well

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,260
obviously they were all of these will in

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,760
a goodness of time but it does mean that

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,710
we'll be able to actually get our debian

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,050
a.m. eyes up onto the larger instance

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:27,010
sizes for example the cluster compute

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,660
instances and the graphics instances

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,400
cluster graphics instances with the

00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,160
nvidia tesla cards and whatever else

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,100
happens in the future with their family

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,360
so I'm thinking that this is a yes but

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,440
then the question also becomes should we

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:47,290
do that for s3 backed hvm in 32 and

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:50,560
64-bit times nine regions I have a

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:57,850
question if you do drop 32-bit and if

00:12:50,560 --> 00:13:01,450
you do are they all going to be possible

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,820
for user who is so motivated to continue

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,250
to create such an image with our method

00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,640
on and run it on your cloud because if

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:13,510
so then if we handle most of the cases

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,930
and make it clear how to do the official

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,809
equivalent yeah

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,519
with their use case in a different

00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:21,499
permutation that seems great

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,839
for example in Google's cloud we only

00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:25,850
ship 64-bit images right now but I

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,319
believe build a bean cloud support I

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,290
haven't tested it so much but the

00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:31,879
support ought to work for 32-bit I'm not

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,290
sure about kernel stuff but we're going

00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:37,759
to allow arbitrary kernel to it anyway

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:39,439
so yeah I I think the Scriptures support

00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:45,860
it so like all of these things are going

00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:47,329
to be supported yeah absolutely I think

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,089
I think that the the build script that

00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:53,420
Anders has got should do all the

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:55,160
permutations that we want please write

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,420
patches put them in if there's if

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,730
there's a permutation that you feel is

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,290
that you're passionate about you know

00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,779
chat up on the mailing list and we'll

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:05,569
talk about how we can do it I obviously

00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:08,779
have created an AWS account specifically

00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:10,009
for us as the debian group to work in so

00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,110
I'll give you access to that and you can

00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:14,329
test all of these images and and and do

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:18,249
anything you want so if you'd like to

00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:20,240
work on any of this let me know okay um

00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:22,939
lifecycle management I'm sorry I should

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,480
ask any other points of the current

00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:27,410
images that we're generating I'd like to

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,339
automate some of it because at the

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,829
moment the way I'm doing it is I I have

00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:36,230
a user data script which I've put into

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:38,929
an instance and I put a spot bidding and

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,449
an instance the Hutt's off and it

00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:43,850
installs the script from github and

00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:45,319
install sceeto obviously and then from

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,629
github forgets the script runs the

00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:49,309
script and then it terminates itself

00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:50,809
when it's so basically their spot

00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,149
biddies around for about five minutes

00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:54,910
and I do that times eight regions and

00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:59,569
they're all built independently locally

00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,769
and yeah that's what I need to sort of

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:03,459
do that next step in automate that as

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:11,149
well anything else we want to do with

00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:13,910
the current permutations No okay so

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:16,569
lifecycle management and hopefully you

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:19,850
guys will have something on this so I'm

00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:21,439
606 I got rid of uh what two weeks ago

00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,029
so I gave notice about the beginning of

00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:24,259
July so I gave about three weeks notice

00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,910
I think I'd even spoken about it earlier

00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:28,449
and earlier post on the Debian cloud

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,449
mailing list

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:36,100
a mais generally from most vendors

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,500
changeover time a security rollup means

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,540
a new ami which means a new ami ID and

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,340
the reason this is important is as we

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,590
were talking about earlier beforehand if

00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,540
it's embedded into an auto scale

00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,790
configuration or a cloud formation

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,290
template and the ami is no longer

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,000
available then obviously you need to do

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,560
some maintenance to keep that going in

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,030
the current way that the cloud formation

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,050
works I feel that we should keep 607 I

00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,900
don't think there's any reason to get

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,730
rid of 607 because you never know in in

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,820
three four or five years time you might

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:09,250
come back and say I need to go back to a

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,650
squeeze image does everyone feel the

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,590
same that we should keep these old ones

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:18,420
yeah so then the initial next question

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:21,040
becomes 7.0 to be no other release

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,010
typically at the end of the lifecycle of

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,460
an old stable the release team does

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:32,050
upon release yeah eventually your six

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:33,910
0.7 will get duplicated form security

00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,500
yes but what if you wanted to start one

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,720
up you're desperate to find a name an

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,310
hour an image to start up 67 in a couple

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,320
years time given yes you know you're not

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,270
gonna get any security updates yes but

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,600
then why would you want 6:07 and

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:49,420
nought-60 99 yeah so the lot the the

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,070
ultimate one whether it's 8 9 10

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:56,670
whatever comes up we should keep

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:56,670
updating to that at that point yes

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,639
[Music]

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,500
that's an interesting question because

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,390
obviously when the image is generated

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:19,540
the sources.list talks to the current oh

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:21,339
um look I guess maybe then does do we

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,870
need to separate our archive from from

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,339
the main distribution over time we've

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,620
done why have we done so up to now to

00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,660
conserve space to reduce Mirror space

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:34,410
for our kind of mirrors that they take

00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,410
copies yeah

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:45,670
if SH Keys enabled

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:48,530
here we go microphone coming lavalla

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:52,760
since sh t is enabled by default on

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:55,610
image right how sensible is it to keep

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,040
an image which is likely to get insecure

00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,360
just a few months after it's deprecated

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,210
by Debian sorry can you say that one

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,360
more time how lucky is it to have an

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:08,000
image which is insecure a few months

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,920
after Debian stop providing security

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,880
updates well it depends on how you're

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,230
launching it if you're launching it

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,820
within a virtual private cloud where

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,040
there's no public access to that image

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,950
then it's a resource for you to use

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,860
would you want a 607 publicly facing

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,570
right now well right now it's probably

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,310
okay but in four years time you probably

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,930
don't want a publicly facing but you do

00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,000
still want it launch a ball inside a

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,710
virtual private cloud or with a security

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,970
group that's completely closed because

00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:36,800
you've got something that you need to do

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:41,240
to that image so do you have somebody to

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,590
enforce that no you you have complete

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,510
control over whether you make a public

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:50,080
facing or not I think we should do is we

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:50,080
should advise you know yes this is an

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,310
absolutely just because we stopped

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,840
supporting squeeze from from security

00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:28,820
updates doesn't mean people stopped

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:34,490
running on the internet so we keep them

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:40,600
verbatim as they are good they can't

00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:43,520
hear you on the stream was it so uh

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,070
coming to the bottom 7.1 a so for those

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,320
that didn't see obviously we noticed

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:51,139
when just after a couple days after 7.1

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,860
came out that we hadn't reinitialized

00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:58,580
the ecliptic curve cryptography host key

00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:03,230
which is new in seven with OpenSSH six

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:06,169
was that or new what anyone familiar and

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:08,509
so we generated a whole heap of new a.m.

00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:08,809
eyes and I just went for it needs a new

00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,039
number

00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:12,980
we need this out there quickly let's

00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,539
make it seven point one a and obviously

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,880
Ellen become seventy-two when we do the

00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:22,039
next point release of queasy I got rid

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,470
of the original seven point one because

00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:25,789
the time frame between the two was three

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,649
days four days

00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:29,659
I got obviously gave it at what two

00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:32,710
weeks or so of notice before I did that

00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:41,259
but I haven't got rid of seven zero

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:45,230
should we now following following sorry

00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:50,929
should web yes without the B so let me

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:52,159
know meter should we now is are we from

00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:54,379
the raw we had here where we said would

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,909
keep the last point release of old state

00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,889
which should we also keep the last point

00:20:55,909 --> 00:21:00,860
release of current stable with some

00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:08,059
window as we migrate through so it 7-0

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:10,220
now useless yeah general consensus is it

00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,629
confusing to the customers it seems to

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,580
me that I would be if I was trying to

00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:15,590
figure out which of these I want I mean

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:23,509
seven and six I can kind of wrap my

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:26,389
absolutely but having by think the

00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:27,889
biggest number wins but I think I think

00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:29,690
getting rid of seven zero would make it

00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:35,450
simpler because less choice is easier to

00:21:29,690 --> 00:22:00,950
make a choice like a proper deprecation

00:21:35,450 --> 00:22:03,540
lifecycle for prior the only yeah

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,800
so so the two ways that we're

00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,570
distributing these area meyers through

00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,240
marketplace and through our own amazon

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,700
web services account the marketplace has

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,070
been updated to be this six or seven and

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,900
seven 1a that's all you can see you

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,960
can't see 7-0 anymore however we've

00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,060
still got seven zero in our own account

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,280
so what I'm proposing is we take that

00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,390
away from being marked as public which

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,250
was the same process I did for the

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,360
others I I took away the public share so

00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,390
that nobody could actually launch them

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,430
and I waited for someone to scream

00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:34,110
nobody screamed so two weeks later three

00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,610
weeks later or whatever I remove those

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,680
ami so they know it were no longer there

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,420
because we will need to do management of

00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,100
this over time there's a large amount of

00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:44,160
storage being taken up by all of these

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,900
times eight nine regions now and

00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,190
obviously more to come over time that

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,600
we're going to have to to be able to

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,910
manage this in some some fashion

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,730
especially if we do ever do some of the

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,990
next points which are coming up such as

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,840
other flavors of Debian that we might

00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:59,760
want to do or blend potentially so

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,080
general consensus was drop seven zero

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:09,330
just just one more check on that yep so

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:13,620
please if you want to keep last yeah

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:16,260
final just because somebody wait you

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,420
don't want to have 7.0 she says if

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:22,320
somebody wants to play with it good

00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:23,820
question it keeps yeah I think the

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,650
likelihood is that most people are going

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,300
to be more interested in getting the

00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,560
final version because honeypot isn't the

00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,000
only reason why you want to start up an

00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,040
old version it might be that you have

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,080
some software that you found that you

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:38,520
need to restore from a backup and you

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,530
need to take it back to 2010 so I think

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,890
there's there's more value in in the

00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:48,000
ultimate old stable versus random other

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:52,080
point releases yeah hey one of the back

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,570
place specifically for 7.0 yes some

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,560
reason you want to keep the C 6.0 you

00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:01,790
may want to say we keep the 7.0 forever

00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:05,270
forever so some music and

00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:08,550
get this one and maybe I put the update

00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,890
to seven-point let's say at some point

00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,810
where 7.5 so they were a six to seven

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:17,220
point zero up to 80 to seven point two

00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:20,790
yes and again also you mentioned that

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:24,690
people may want to use backup and

00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:26,370
restore an application and they're

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,070
probably not going to want to backup

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,560
this two weeks after the dissolution is

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,720
deprecated it's more going to be one

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,540
year and then it said oh damn it we

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,750
would not have that server in-house

00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,550
anymore we want and enable us to restore

00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,760
data and I see where you're coming from

00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:47,760
but I also counter that with the changes

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,730
of from 7 0 to 7 1 a being point

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,960
releases the compatibility I think we

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,850
generally keep there because as we said

00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,900
just in the pre discussion is the only

00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,920
changes that are going in there are

00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:02,010
security fixes and not major features so

00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,260
I don't want to let us with 20,000 a.m.

00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,660
is that we're trying to manage but I do

00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,940
think that that the most useful one is

00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,290
the ultimate point release from every

00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,120
every release we had so if we could go

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:18,450
back to five point what was our last 5

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:20,400
release any one 5 10 5 10 500 10 so 5

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,230
our 10 might be useful obviously would

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,180
need support for the hypervisor in use

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,700
here which I don't know if we had a

00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,840
kernel then even that did it so there's

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,730
interesting things if we wanted to do a

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,410
historical projection and if people want

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,090
to do a historical project if someone

00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:36,390
here says they want to go and make a bow

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:40,380
and ass link and a ham back on here

00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:55,200
obviously you'd have to do some but that

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:59,690
would be really interesting yes yes if

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,690
you every version of every package ever

00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:12,040
25 terabytes and growing cool ok

00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,320
additions so we've only got base images

00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,090
at the moment when we've put in 100% DFS

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,350
G compatible software obviously it's all

00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,180
done from the script everything is

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:21,310
covered by the the licensing which we're

00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,960
happy with we said we should put in

00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,700
cloud on it from back ports for base

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,910
images we've kind of agreed on that so

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,770
far should we have an image with boto

00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,610
s3 tools another SDKs that's kind of

00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:34,360
repeating what I was talking about

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:37,200
before um ah that's a DS repeating what

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:42,100
I said before isn't it yes moving on

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,930
security so here we talk about a cc now

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,820
when the ECC stuff came out I it was it

00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:48,040
was 2 o'clock in the morning for me I

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,570
was horizontal at the time and when I

00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,610
woke up at 6 I saw that somebody'd mout

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,190
the security team which was Grutter does

00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,780
anyone here who did that no it was great

00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,580
the security team had been notified and

00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:01,480
I went right ok so I'll wait for their

00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:04,150
response ok this is taken this off for

00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,350
breakfast now hmm I'll go and start

00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,310
generating these images just in case

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,050
somebody says yes do it

00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:09,550
and so I generated the images and they

00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:12,370
went when it's getting up to sort of

00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,900
11:00 a.m. now I might just start to

00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,430
roll this because we needed to get a fix

00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:20,050
out there so I don't know what our our

00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,190
relationship should be with security for

00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,390
Debian security whether we should just

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,890
roll in you release and you're gonna

00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,900
have the same question that comes up as

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,130
well because we have one or two little

00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,800
extensions like this now we obviously

00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,820
want to keep these issues to a minimum

00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:35,950
we've said all along we want minimum

00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:37,030
changes from a base install what else

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,430
should we do are we happy with the fact

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,620
we went to 7.1 a do we want some other

00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:43,210
process in future how are we gonna

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:56,820
handle this and this is Jimmy I can see

00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:56,820
a super mic right here

00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,720
and I think for things like Colonel zero

00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:26,999
days then we need to also push the

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,559
security team and see if they're going

00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,479
to release a new package of the kernel

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:38,519
into Siri updates and just pull that

00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:40,919
into a new and we want to keep these

00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:44,220
exceptions to a minimum I think this yes

00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,139
we should fix this once anyone else got

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,580
any other ideas or questions on security

00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:49,080
with regards to the images I also

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,179
mentioned earlier about deny hosts or

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,539
fail to ban um since we've got OpenSSH

00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:56,309
installed by default and open by default

00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:58,049
obviously there's security groups around

00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:59,460
to restrict it at launch time

00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:02,039
should we have something like fail to

00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,899
ban or deny hosts or some other before

00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,479
that just talking about the dates yeah

00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:09,299
when we have a point release and then

00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:11,309
just right after we have security

00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:16,559
problems that is getting fixed through

00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:20,700
the security repository then if you are

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:23,129
going to release a new image that's not

00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,499
going to be the one release yes it's

00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:32,279
going to be an intermediate yes so in

00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:34,169
that case it will be released updates so

00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:36,929
I think it's very important that we

00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:39,239
notify our users of that and that we

00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:41,820
make sure that we all do the same work

00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:42,929
on all clouds at the same time so that

00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,200
raises another thing is that when our

00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:48,359
images boot they do not do apt-get

00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,029
update they do not get apt-get upgrade -

00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,919
dy4 all pending security at the point of

00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:54,570
that launch and the reason for that is

00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,690
because the instance from my point is

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,739
the instance may be launching inside a

00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:01,559
network where it's got no access to any

00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:02,789
archives so hey it can't update and be

00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,519
mine I'll be vulnerable to it because

00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:08,190
it's running inside a walled garden

00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:11,549
effectively also we don't install

00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,720
unattended updates by default do we feel

00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:15,299
we should have unattended updates

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:25,529
installed now I'm getting an open yeah

00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:27,570
so we don't do everything we can to lock

00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:30,450
down the machine yeah and sometimes we

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,280
fought back when we went to Debian from

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,200
our previous operating system

00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,000
I fought back a little bit and tried to

00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,440
say hey by the way maybe Debian should

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,700
be involved in figuring out what the

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,470
default policy is but more I hear you

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,420
talk and the more I hear our security

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:48,000
teams talk I have a feeling that really

00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:51,000
the clouds requirements here just it

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,980
makes more sense to protect users from

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,380
vulnerabilities and so forth then - then

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,720
it like it makes sense to do something

00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,180
that the rest of Debian is doing even if

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,680
that makes sense you know saying so yeah

00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,560
I feel that the standard for cloud

00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,760
Debian should be definitely different

00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,860
right we should be locking it down we

00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,900
should have deny house we had it in our

00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,360
previous image we don't have it now in

00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,770
our Debian image we should be disabling

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,620
root login by default

00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:20,700
let users override it I saw you had a

00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,720
comment to get the other microphone over

00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:28,470
there no you okay somebody else got

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,790
input on this so I see that there are

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,580
three parties at play here there's the

00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:35,910
cloud vendor there is debian and there

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,320
is the user now the from Amazon's point

00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,730
of view we we say we operate a shared

00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,520
security environment that obviously

00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,990
everything that the hypervisor in the

00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,480
physical environment is done is taken

00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,770
care of by by Amazon operating system

00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,250
patches are the responsibility of the

00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,660
end user I think what David you're

00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,850
implying there is that how much does

00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:56,070
Debian want to do on behalf of the user

00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:59,880
to pre secure that environment for them

00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:02,550
in that model but then that's not just a

00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,500
question for for cloud that's also a

00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,760
question for Debian in general on every

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,010
other piece of infrastructure we deploy

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,680
on I just potentially we've just

00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,270
profiled the risk to be lower when it's

00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:17,310
running on a lab in your home behind

00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:22,860
your net thank you for the water whoever

00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:27,990
put there so other things

00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:32,360
anything else we should do so we like

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:32,360
tonight hosts no

00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,480
I don't like to discuss policies because

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,100
we the cloud have a specific need I

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,260
really think it should be more brought

00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:48,830
inside Debian so why should we take it

00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:50,419
to the discussion tech committee that

00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:53,059
going too high too big a hammer if

00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:55,190
you're just installing a new package yes

00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:56,870
fine if he's changing the behavior of a

00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,250
package or its default configuration

00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:02,059
then I think you should deal with the

00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:03,530
current maintainer of the message and I

00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:04,610
think it's just installer package I

00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,840
think we're just saying which packages

00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:09,850
should be available there then I'm fine

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,850
with that yeah ok cool

00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:20,650
excellent yes please get the contents of

00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:23,750
did I host who will put it together

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:25,600
whether has did I host sorry the

00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,909
contents of deny host who put together

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,940
this package maintainer it'll populate

00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:35,090
itself by by whatever happens with

00:33:31,940 --> 00:34:18,260
regards to access to the host so there's

00:33:35,090 --> 00:34:19,580
no but for period of time or is this an

00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,520
overreaction given that we're only doing

00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:24,830
ssh authentication with keys only thank

00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:29,450
you so there's this a trade-off there

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:31,190
okay other ideas is the general stuff

00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,629
what else are we not currently doing for

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:37,669
the a.m. eyes on Debian that we should

00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:41,389
do yes Thomas give it to us we are only

00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:43,970
publishing it on Amazon right well we

00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:46,970
need a place where we publish all our DB

00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:49,129
on clouds with a request the

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,800
need of having a credit card resisted on

00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:54,139
whatever provider I could not test the

00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,080
ami because I didn't have in Amazon

00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:59,570
Cloud account right um you're welcome to

00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:07,099
have a login on to the Amazon Sheri we

00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:08,750
don't want thank you for coming but

00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:10,250
that's the different thing but I think

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,710
everybody should be able to download it

00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:17,030
and I think that these cloud images

00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:18,859
should be on the Debian repository if we

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,970
consider them official yeah so I did

00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:22,520
start with the first one I very first

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:24,710
started doing this I dumped and gzipped

00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,990
from the snapshot into an s3 bucket so

00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,160
it was publicly downloadable but that

00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:31,609
was all manual steps and I didn't get a

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,070
scripted that may end up being more than

00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:35,630
you want the I mean maybe you only want

00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:39,290
the latest version of any of these

00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:41,720
things but like I don't know we keep the

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,250
latest every single version we that's

00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,720
ever been published we have kind of

00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,630
available we deprecate them and stuff

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,640
but they're still there

00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:51,640
it's gigabytes upon gigabytes funky

00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,339
images by the way I don't think we like

00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:03,910
we should actually publicize a few that

00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:06,650
I mean wiki but like all the ones we

00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:09,230
published the Debian project I've

00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,520
actually shared publicly in a google

00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,720
cloud storage bucket and what I mean

00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:17,119
publicly I mean you could just browse to

00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:26,900
it via HTTP and it could also be put in

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:29,000
the Debian there's the Google I'm sorry

00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,670
but the tibia the Google infrastructure

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,460
is not the DNS has to be on the Debian

00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:44,150
infrastructure to my front of you but is

00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:46,160
there any you say yeah they touch is

00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:49,580
that we we currently upload all of our

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,560
images to Google Cloud Storage I don't

00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:54,440
know if it makes sense but we can easily

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,670
give you guys those URLs we can you want

00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,820
some hosted on Debian inter touch as

00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,680
well yeah absolutely

00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,690
I'm saying it's like I don't know if I

00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,550
want to decide the policy of what hit

00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:09,080
stored on Debian servers but I can make

00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,900
it so that they can copy whatever those

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:15,970
files that they want or pushed because I

00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:18,650
want I also love to have those images

00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:22,190
created at the same time as the DB on

00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:24,680
CDs which is why I think it would be

00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:26,630
best to have everything built out of the

00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,610
Debian archive without access to

00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:30,770
provider because that way we can give

00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:33,320
the scripts to let's say Steve McIntyre

00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:35,180
if he's still doing the cities and then

00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,550
he would create the cloud images and

00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:45,200
they will be released at the same second

00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:47,870
when we do about release nothing is good

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,890
and our images do not have to be built

00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:52,700
on the cloud we're not doing that either

00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:54,110
but we release more often than the

00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,700
corresponding Debian stable release

00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:59,120
because of various fixes like we've been

00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,800
discussing so it's actually reasonable

00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,090
to release a new image when a debian

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,340
point release goes out but it's not

00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:06,740
going to be only then but I think it's

00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,660
great I think it's a fine idea to when

00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,610
the when the build happens upload it to

00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:14,230
both Deb unit and Google doors the

00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:14,230
second one is required for the adding

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,930
okay but my mono is not that you guys at

00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:24,500
Google uploaded my ponies to automate it

00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:28,030
within the process it's just not just a

00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,030
CD release it's more frequent that's all

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:39,800
yeah cool

00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:42,910
any more questions any more suggestions

00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,910
any anything at all

00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:50,980
now okay I'll throw it open to any

00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:52,420
questions about Amazon or anything at

00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,410
all as opposed to just the a.m. eyes

00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,789
what we've been doing in the rest of

00:38:53,410 --> 00:39:07,869
stuff anybody got any questions I want

00:38:54,789 --> 00:39:11,799
to ask No cool yes are they are they in

00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:13,210
a package in Maine so no this this is

00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:15,789
actually a really good thing um

00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,529
the tools the tools I think are

00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:18,880
universally useful that they should be

00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:20,380
installed one on no matter which

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,059
platform because just because an

00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,890
instance is running on Amazon it might

00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:26,140
want to talk to Google storage and vice

00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:29,230
versa one of your in images running on

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,210
Google compute might want to talk to s3

00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,099
specifically we might want to take the

00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,509
images and the ami is that we've all

00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:36,069
generated and throw them onto the

00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:37,390
storage on each other's clouds and that

00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:38,529
might alleviate the question of voice

00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,970
not on Damien's infrastructure no but

00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:41,890
it's on multiple cloud providers and

00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:45,519
we've we've covered the infrastructure

00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:53,410
that way yeah yeah say but you're

00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:55,210
thinking no yes and so I've got idea

00:39:53,410 --> 00:40:03,670
about generating those images regardless

00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:18,970
whether they are own so are we intending

00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:19,630
to as soon as we have CDs yeah yeah I

00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,069
think so

00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,230
if there's a release then we want to on

00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:24,940
on all the platforms as quickly as

00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,049
possible then and one of the other

00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,599
questions is at the moment we haven't

00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:29,829
generated any Jesse images should we

00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:32,920
start doing that and at what frequency

00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:35,499
should we start doing that and and I had

00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,739
Steve come and ask me yesterday how

00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:43,059
about getting a cloud imager that uses

00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:45,279
systemd how about we test yeah how about

00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:46,539
we yeah how about we test both of them

00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,829
and have cloud images for both I mean do

00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:49,599
we want to use that as a platform you

00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:51,190
know on any of the vendors but obviously

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,539
we want to generate a.m. eyes which do

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,839
this that we can then open up for people

00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:54,839
to test

00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:02,450
you have nightly builds for or DIY not

00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:07,490
have yeah we could do you got the 90

00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:09,859
Thomas yeah should do that yeah well no

00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:13,970
we just need to script it we script it

00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:15,619
it'll happen yeah yeah but obviously I I

00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,910
would suggest we probably don't push

00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:19,819
nightly builds through the marketplace

00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:22,640
because that's going to confuse our new
