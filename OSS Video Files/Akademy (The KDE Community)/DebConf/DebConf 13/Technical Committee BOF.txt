	00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,519
so good evening everyone we have four

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,070
members of the Technical Committee with

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:16,170
us tonight for a Technical Committee

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:18,570
buffs so let's get started thank you

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,550
very much for those of you who weren't

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,850
here earlier don't know who I am I'm be

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,710
Dale I currently serve as chairman of

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,500
the Debian Technical Committee we have

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,689
three other members with this present in

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,880
fact let me go ahead and change the next

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,829
slide it's the current membership of the

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,960
committee I thought Steve Blank Scheck

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,120
was gonna be here by now and there are

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,070
rumors that emails from him are flying

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,920
around so a plane may have landed

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,629
somewhere or something I don't know but

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,230
I'm here russell berrie and don

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:52,260
armstrong are not here this year Andy's

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,730
here in and Colin and as I said I think

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,280
Steve is on the way but I haven't

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,320
actually seen him yet so this is the

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,079
current membership of the Technical

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,570
Committee I guess the change from last

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,460
year is that manoda Srivastava chose to

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,979
step down from the committee I think we

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,860
all thank him for his service to the

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,500
committee over the years we are of

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,030
course considering possible new members

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,170
for the future we'll talk about that a

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,000
little bit to just sort of set context

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,060
for those of you who don't think about

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,400
these details all the time the existence

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,100
of the Debian Technical Committee is

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,930
defined by section 6 of the Debian

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,090
Constitution these various sub pieces

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,460
sort of provide the context and the

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,920
authority by which the committee exists

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,590
and in some ways bound what the sort of

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,450
desirable and appropriate areas of

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,890
activity by the committee are a couple

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,960
of things that I think are worth

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,780
pointing to specifically are the fact

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,540
that 635 sort of suggests that it's not

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,090
really within the technical committees

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,460
purview to be designing new proposals

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,670
that doesn't mean that members of the

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,430
technical committee can't be themselves

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,290
coming up with new ideas or contributing

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,780
to group activities that lead to new

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,840
proposed

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,780
but the real purpose of the committee

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,430
when it boils down to you know sort of

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,370
the simplest form is that we're here to

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:28,630
help arbitrate and help make decisions

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,670
win developers working on software or

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,560
other things within the project cannot

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,280
decide among themselves what the right

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,010
answer is and that's really sort of the

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,280
focus of what the Technical Committee is

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,530
about so unlike in some projects where

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,680
there's a lot of decision-making that

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,680
happens on a routine basis by some

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,280
overarching technical body in debian our

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,540
Constitution sort of inverts that

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,320
responsibility if you will and the vast

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,209
majority of decisions are assumed to be

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,670
owned by and made by individual

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,650
developers working on the things that

00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,810
they do for the project and it's only

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,680
when those developers come into conflict

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,810
and need help resolving questions that

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,010
the Technical Committee generally

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:20,080
becomes involved having said that we

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,170
have over the last years have been

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,810
trying to have some irregular IRC

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,180
meetings I think approximately once a

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:32,920
month though they don't always go off as

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:35,380
planned these are not necessarily where

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,299
big decisions get made but they're an

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,000
opportunity for us to remind each other

00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:42,970
on the committee of what the open action

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,250
items are to discuss informally what

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,799
progress we've made working on the

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,930
various issues and in effect to sort of

00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,120
poke each other to see who volunteers to

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,459
take the lead on taking the next steps

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,959
on some things and one of the

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,750
consequences of that that I'm very

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,540
pleased about to report on is that this

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,040
year the list of open issues before the

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,530
committee right now does not include

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,420
anything that was on that list this time

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,860
of year ago and that's actually the

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,110
first time in several years that I've

00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:14,140
been able to say that we had a couple of

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,630
long-standing thorny ugly problems that

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,729
nobody really knew how to or wanted to

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,820
deal with and those have all been

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:23,650
resolved so the issues that are the five

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,870
issues that are actually open in the bug

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,120
tracking system before the committee

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,820
this year are

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,090
you know all essentially sort of current

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,180
things and I feel pretty good about that

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,940
with that that's really the the some of

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,440
the sort of presentation part of what I

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,000
wanted to do today to provide a little

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,070
bit of context with four of the now

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,190
seven of us here and the possibility

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,960
that Steve might show up at some point

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,810
this is an excellent opportunity for any

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,300
of you have questions about any of the

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,120
open issues opinions on things want to

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,130
understand how the committee thinks

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,870
about things what we're what our

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,730
thoughts are on some of these matters or

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,710
whatever to ask questions and for us to

00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,170
have an open discussion this is meant to

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,420
be a boffin at a presentation so at this

00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,160
point I'm going to step down from stage

00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,960
join my colleagues and the chairs over

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,090
here we've got a mic that we'll pass

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,670
around and there's at least one here

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,740
that will be used to take questions from

00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:29,800
the audience so who would like to kick

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:32,110
things off come on don't be shy

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:37,300
you didn't all come up here just because

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:39,140
it's a prettier face place to sit yeah

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:44,720
Keith

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:47,560
I was supposed to have a question now I

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,560
just came up for the view

00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,490
no it wasn't exciting was disturbing he

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,590
said um are there are there pending

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,880
issue do you have a queue of issues that

00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,140
you're looking at that you think are

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,390
going to become things of the tech

00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,190
committee needs to resolve what kinds of

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,970
things are looking like they're becoming

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:17,300
issues within the community ah no we

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:19,790
don't have a list of things that we're

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,360
kind of holding off on putting on that

00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:28,190
list that's the list of the things that

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,840
we know are on our plate I'm sure people

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,480
have their own ideas about what things

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,540
might be turning up at the Technical

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,340
Committee formally or informally we had

00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,320
a bit of discussion recently about the

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:44,600
whole system D thing but I was about to

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:47,440
ask that it doesn't seem to congealed

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,670
yet into the kind of question that

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,930
anybody could decide on and I think

00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,480
that's one of the reasons why we keep

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,980
having these conversations well in by

00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,260
surveys attention the committee doesn't

00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:01,010
just act because we think we need to act

00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,810
so the only active if bidder holds a

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,970
list of things before so if developers

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,090
couldn't agree on it

00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:10,040
people could ask us to make a decision

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,600
so I could do or similar but we're not

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,040
just doing a decision because we think

00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,950
it might be an issue that needs to be

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,630
decided so unless I asked later honor

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,330
that process I don't think we're

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,510
currently there active which does

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,250
prevent us from looking at the things

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,140
right and I think specifically with

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,720
regard to the system D enough start the

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:33,530
the parties involved are still actively

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:36,110
through encoded each other and until it

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:41,330
gets to the point where either somebody

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:44,000
wins or they feel that they've reached

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,190
utter impasse and there's no further way

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
that anything develop I think that's

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,260
that would be the point when when it

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,730
would be brought to us and I divide

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,410
that it doesn't yes so generally things

00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,320
are brought to the committee because

00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,390
there's an existing bug in the BTS that

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,950
someone you know that people are getting

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,600
in an argument over how it ought to be

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,060
resolved or something like that and

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,380
those bugs get reassigned to us

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,750
occasionally somebody writes a new bug

00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,510
submission as a way of crafting a

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,820
question for the committee but generally

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,680
when that happens it's an indication

00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,540
that it's going to either be something

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,330
that's only marginally within the tech

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,800
committees responsibility or that it's

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,200
going to be particularly difficult to

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,270
resolve the things the questions where

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,520
we're they're able to sort of act i

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,040
think the most expeditiously is where

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,169
it's a question of you know yes or no on

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,710
this particular patch set or this

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,150
particular you know intended change the

00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,680
last one on the list here is actually

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,990
sort of an interesting example that

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,900
somewhere between some of those things

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,420
and the sort of systemd kind of question

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,760
in that we were sort of asked to help

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,070
make a decision about which of the jpeg

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,170
library implementation should be the

00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,600
default one that lives in the

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,400
distribution and this is a case where

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,770
you know the initial set of questions

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,230
that we fired back at the parties

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,730
involved we're all around you know are

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,430
we really to the point where we can sort

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,410
of pick a or b or are there in fact

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,510
things that would have to be implemented

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,670
or something first to have a complete

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,350
solution in place part of the reasons

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,670
not completely resolved yet is at least

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,990
in my mind i don't think we have a

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,820
complete set of answers to those

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,020
questions yet though maybe it's just

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,490
because i have been a little distracted

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,930
lately but in looking at it this is led

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,970
to a very healthy discussion where

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,800
people are pointing out what other

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,510
distributions are doing there's

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,310
discussion about what the technical

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,920
basis of the distinctions between the

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:42,680
different implementations are pointing

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,140
to conflicts in external standards

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,760
bodies that lead to you know matters of

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,590
interpretation about what the right way

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,050
to proceed is and so forth and that's

00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:54,260
all exactly the kind of you know sort of

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,240
helping to muddle through the what in

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,550
the end is sort of a combination of a

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,640
technical choice bound up in you know

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,170
which of two forks of a project we ought

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,760
to be paying the most attention to kind

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,890
of thing that

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,830
think it's useful for us as a committee

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,000
to try and help with but as Colin says

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,540
you know when you're in a situation

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,190
where people with competing ideas or

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,230
competing proposals are still sort of

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,150
you know rapidly throwing code at each

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,780
other it's not time for us to be

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:24,970
involved if we had our choice most such

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,650
decisions would be resolved by the

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,670
developers in question I never come to

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:32,410
the committee yeah I just wanted to do

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,470
it expand on that a bit

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,960
so the JPEG one at least in principle is

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,110
something where there's a bit specific

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,000
technical change that the TC could

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,100
decide to do one way or the other it

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,920
amounts to the ownership of Lib JPEG dev

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,180
the package name and you know what JPEG

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,920
live would you get if you install that

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,150
and there a whole bunch of consequences

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,630
that flow from that but there's actually

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:57,820
a clear underlying technical decision to

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,360
be made and the systemd one I think one

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,590
of the reasons why the the argument

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,570
keeps turning up again on Debian

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,760
developers because there's a lot of fear

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,290
about what might or might not be done

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,760
and are people you know worried about

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,740
this and people pushing their various

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,380
agendas but there's not actually a

00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,360
particular technical change but somebody

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,950
who is in charge of something as a

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,650
maintainer or that the Technical

00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:23,950
Committee as a arbitration body could

00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,750
could decide on this nobody is proposing

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,610
oh where we will make the following

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,160
specific changes the following packages

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,200
to achieve this objective at the moment

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,390
people are still talking in woolly terms

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,160
about throwing this in or throwing that

00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,790
out or making everything the default or

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,480
making everything mandatory and it's

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:47,590
it's not really at a actual decision and

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,970
I'm personally I'm hoping that before we

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,340
have to have another conversation about

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,530
the merits one thing or another we might

00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:57,430
get to the point where there is actually

00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:59,650
two different technical things that

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,090
might be done and then we could have a

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:05,740
question about which of those was better

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:08,230
I didn't if now if you look at the last

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,330
issues that I have with JPEG what we

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,300
actually do is there we can't decide but

00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,580
what we are doing is to get us in place

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,880
maybe know okay what are the benefits of

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,790
fish solution so

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,750
we actually could do a decision and we

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:26,420
have typically an ear to that place this

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:29,060
is a let's say this system D or whatever

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,940
discussion we are far more away from it

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,380
and driving something to that place can

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,030
actually be done by the developers in

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,060
question it does need to take a

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:41,830
committee but yeah we could try to help

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:44,390
if necessarily but it's not something

00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,670
special on a spur just special on

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,530
getting things done in a way that

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:52,940
everybody would understand what it

00:12:48,530 --> 00:13:03,260
implies and means so I would say then

00:12:52,940 --> 00:13:06,260
next question so currently is a nice

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:10,630
team sorry the Technical Committee gets

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:14,660
into action only if explicitly addressed

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:18,410
so what's the committee see it's all a

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:22,220
bit more proactive if well some kind of

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:24,970
development is stalled within Debian two

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,560
examples all that the one is

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,740
architectural requalification we had

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,530
that addressed last step conf nothing

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:37,010
that happened we did have it addressed

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:40,130
shortly after the weazy release until

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:43,580
now nothing much did happen there are a

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:48,470
lot of teams involved with that and I

00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:51,280
think something should happen but nobody

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,770
tries to do something the other thing is

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:59,030
I'm a bit stuck with my proposal about

00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:01,400
verbose built Knox which teams everybody

00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,890
seems to be in violent agreement about

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,010
that but nothing does happen it's

00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:11,030
stalled and it would be nice to base

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:13,520
some further QA work on that so general

00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,460
development would help so the question

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,430
again could the Technical Committee a

00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:22,460
bit more proactive for kind of these

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:25,430
things okay I will just start with the

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,589
first question as some of you know I've

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,360
asked members I'm still a member of the

00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:30,300
least him I've also this measure a few

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,110
years ago

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:36,330
so who does losers decision Tetris on

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:39,540
Debian and with visage Tetris Debian

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,490
releases the first question which I

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,160
Tetris our independence the archive is

00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,230
tamper FTP masters in second question

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,690
which I Tetris arm part of all the

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,850
leaves are done by the released team so

00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,280
I think so others have two bodies of

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:56,280
Debian who have to first say on that if

00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,990
someone disagrees with sell decisions of

00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,480
course it could be escalated to host

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,640
Angela committee obviously like with

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,070
other tangle decisions people don't

00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,930
believe us being a certain patch was

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:10,020
objected by maintain or whatever else

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:13,560
but I think one should give some such

00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:16,200
chance for the as I say decide first and

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:20,390
what I have seen is the least team is at

00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:24,300
least currently still in the let's say

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:26,250
post release mode resident who gets a

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,310
sing starting again for the new release

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,490
however I personally wouldn't expect

00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:34,290
decisions on which attractions are fit

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,750
for the next release or not within the

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:39,930
next few months just because they are

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:43,680
currently again getting things summed up

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:46,620
my personal expectation however is said

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,870
I think we are going to lose one or two

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:54,540
iectures set we're already up on the

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,560
edge last time for example cons they

00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,240
sparked dozens on our beauties with

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,310
kernels that we have in stable and trust

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,580
was a current old stable so I'm not sure

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:12,000
this will happen another release cycle

00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:13,920
trust as an example yeah the I think on

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,650
the on more general point of whether the

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:22,020
on proactivity of the tech committee the

00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:25,890
question I would normally ask is is it

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:30,300
going to improve the situation for for

00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:32,460
us to do that so in case of verbose

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,630
build logs I will I'll join in your

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:38,510
violent agreement as a developer as a

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:41,550
member of the tech committee I would

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,170
question where they're coming down from

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,020
the mountain

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,260
on the on the matter we just actually

00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,550
get things done or just make people feel

00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,589
like they're being steamrolled or

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,370
steamrollered and instinctively push

00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:58,200
back so I would I think my my

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:04,829
recommendation for ways forward and that

00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:06,390
is I think I've seen a lot of general

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:09,480
recommendations that we should be doing

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:13,890
X Y and Zed but not generally patches to

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,230
that effect and I'd probably suggests

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:20,579
but patches wait a month or two followed

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:23,130
by an emu campaign pursuant to the usual

00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,500
rules and that sort of thing is probably

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:29,370
likely to get things done more

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:32,460
effectively and annoying fewer people in

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,410
the process than by the technical

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,820
committee coming down laying on tablets

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,140
of stone in the matter that specifically

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,679
the case with a with a thing like that

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:46,380
verbose build lots we're really very few

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,330
people if any I've seen no discussion

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,059
from any be suggesting that this is a

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,980
bad idea everybody seems to agree that

00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:55,650
it's at best neutral and a lot of people

00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,760
are in favor so it's not really the case

00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,080
that there's a disagreement for the

00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,260
technical committee to resolve there's

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,610
just some undone work and like anything

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,960
in the project if there are some undone

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,730
work that is bothering you that it's not

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,460
being done there's a very simple

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:12,690
solution to that yeah I mean I think

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,580
there is I think there are one or two

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,940
glitches but there is nothing major at

00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,940
this point

00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:34,380
come on there needs to be other

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:36,270
questions so the Constitution reads that

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,730
the Technical Committee can be asked for

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:42,330
a device and the past I haven't seen

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:45,540
this being invoked very often so can you

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:48,090
give an example of when to ask the

00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,580
committee for advice and how to do that

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:55,050
because I don't think it's been done by

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:57,810
in creating a buck right so the way that

00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:00,630
has mostly happened up until now that

00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:03,330
I'm aware of has been through informal

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,280
processes usually not asking the

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,890
committee as a whole for an opinion as

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,240
much as seeking out individual members

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,790
of the committee and asking their

00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,400
opinions on things we have had a few

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,700
cases in the past where someone sent an

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,340
email to the committee's email list

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,620
saying this is not something that I feel

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,960
compelled to file a bug about at this

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,390
point but I could use some advice and

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,550
we've had a couple like that

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,940
ian has actually I think one of the

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:37,550
drafts that you've got up right now is

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:39,630
related to making a more formal you

00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:42,120
could describe as better than I'm making

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:45,170
a sort of more formal assertion of what

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:48,270
the mechanisms are by which we can have

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:51,960
sort of non-binding open conversations

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:54,870
about things like this err I think

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,900
you're referring to the proposal to

00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:01,050
regularize private communications with

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,840
the committee so it doesn't happen very

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:06,000
often but particularly sometimes people

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,650
have you know technical things get mixed

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,820
up with interpersonal things and at the

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,980
moment it's very difficult for the

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,720
committee to deal with that in a in a

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,640
kind of properly aboveboard way because

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,370
according to the Constitution we're

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,300
supposed to do everything in public but

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,980
it's very difficult to have a

00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,330
conversation about whether we should

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,330
replace somebody as a package maintainer

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:26,340
or indeed to mediate at an early stage

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,680
when things are going badly wrong if

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,240
everything you know if everything has to

00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,160
be out in public

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,780
in particular if you want to go to the

00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,940
committee and say I'm having a bit of

00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,950
trouble talking to this particular

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,200
maintainer

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,970
you know can you help like help us out

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,390
here that would be a very valuable thing

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:47,270
for us to be able to do because then

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,710
we'd have a history you know if if it

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,280
does come to the crunch and we have to

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,480
decide on a package maintainer ship

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,120
we've already got some kind of

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,610
experience dealing with the maintainer

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,740
ourselves and it doesn't immediately

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,560
escalate the whole thing to a big public

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,580
slaying match it can be just you know I

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,960
think we're having a bit of a

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:11,410
misunderstanding can you help us out

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:14,510
which is a very useful thing to do so

00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,340
one of the things that I've suggested is

00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,470
that the Constitution should be changed

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,560
specifically to allow us to have those

00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:24,470
private conversations not private

00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,680
decision-making but at least private

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:30,230
communications in a sense you can't

00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,820
really stop people doing that and we as

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,380
committee members we've occasionally had

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,650
email sent to some or all of the

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,240
committee at our private email addresses

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,280
and this doesn't seem like a

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,990
particularly good way of carrying on and

00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,610
in the best will in the world you have

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,860
to respond to these emails in a

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:50,360
constructive manner so it's just a bit

00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:53,180
yeah thanks for clarifying Liddy and so

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,490
in the case where what you would like is

00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,680
advice on a technical issue as opposed

00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,620
to you know problem dealing with some

00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,350
individual on the project then I think

00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,420
sending an email to our committee

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,430
mailing list is probably as good as

00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,950
anything in terms of getting the entire

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,660
committee's attention certainly while

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:14,510
we're here at DEFCON for those of you

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,400
who are here this is an opportune time

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,920
to you know come find us casually in the

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,170
hallways or whatever and get advice or

00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,610
guidance or input or whatever I know

00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,590
that you know part of the reason we all

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,290
agreed to participate on the committee

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,420
is that we all have an intense passion

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,400
for this project and a strong desire to

00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,260
see things continue to improve and get

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,030
better and if a little bit of

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,270
conversation about something will help

00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:40,760
you get past a technical hurdle or you

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,170
know help figure out the best way to do

00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,970
something where you're not in conflict

00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,710
with somebody else you just yourself

00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,330
could use some advice and guidance on

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,000
how to do it and we're more than happy

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,980
to help with as much of that as you'd

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,560
like to take advantage of us for I think

00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:58,820
I speak for everybody on that so there's

00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,110
one other thing I want to say about that

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,490
it's not really in direct response to

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,190
your question but your question was I

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,050
think prompted by the thing in the list

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,290
of you know powers that the committee is

00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:12,470
empowered to give advice we often do

00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:16,630
that of our own bat if we are somebody

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:19,910
comes to us with a decision sometimes

00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:22,220
either as part or the entire disposal of

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,900
that is will you know the actual formal

00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,830
resolution from the committee will say

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,660
and furthermore our opinion on this

00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,210
you know our non-binding opinion is is

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,440
this and that could be useful as

00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,930
guidance to other people in the project

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,670
and it can also be useful to people who

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:42,710
need to guess what the committee might

00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:43,850
do in the future but in terms of you you

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,010
wouldn't really want to ask for that

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,420
because the the formal decision-making

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,160
process with the committee of hanging

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,310
votes on resolutions is quite cumbersome

00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:55,160
and not really suited to easily giving

00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:59,570
advice but if you just want if you just

00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:01,040
got some question and you want either

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,270
about a technical disagreement or just

00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,170
about a technical question they're not

00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:09,550
sure of we can certainly help and just

00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:09,550
mailing us is a good plan

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:21,950
yeah you have gonna wolf in the IRC he

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:24,530
says I guess when those semi personal

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:26,720
issues arrive to check the Technical

00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:31,970
Committee they should be redirected to

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,340
DP atomization being the de piel a

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,460
single person and being his pulse most

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:41,480
directly linked to social personal

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:46,940
radiation I think I'd say that it would

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,230
depend on the course if it's if it's one

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,570
of those things that happens all the

00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,640
time where you get a people people get

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:55,330
really passionate about a about a

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,070
technical dispute and it escalates into

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:01,970
either basically just calling each other

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:05,060
names or or there is some kind of more

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:07,010
deeply rooted dispute about each other's

00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,840
working stars come up that comes up that

00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:13,130
sort of thing happens a lot and in that

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,870
case some sometimes sometimes we were

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,150
better off just addressing the technical

00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,780
issue and not actually trying to get

00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:23,450
every single person project to get along

00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:27,500
sometimes it really is something that

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,510
needs personal mediation and I do know

00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,460
that we've talked much about the

00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,590
interplay with detail mediation but

00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,720
maybe we could ask them for help

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,510
rather than necessarily just handing it

00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,760
all over to them and it also depends on

00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:42,350
what's our outcome is or needs to be if

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,420
we notice that that conflict is already

00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,250
broke in a way if we need to decide for

00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,380
example about the ownership of a package

00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,420
we can't just forward it to someone else

00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,420
because we need to take a decision at

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:56,150
the end of course depends sometimes it's

00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,280
just best to tables people and say this

00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:01,970
I took at the mediation instead of

00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:08,390
calling it a committee in other cases it

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:10,550
might not be that useful so I'm not sure

00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:14,990
I speak for my colleagues here but I

00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:16,850
have a personal view on this so that the

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,410
Technical Committee is empowered by the

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,590
Constitution to make decisions about

00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:24,170
package maintainer ship and many of

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:27,489
these kind of disputes that might be

00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:31,190
helpful II resolved through mediation

00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:32,749
ultimately if mediation fails need to be

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:37,639
resolved by a decision about package

00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:41,179
maintainer ship and it's not really

00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:43,539
helpful to have those kind of things

00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:46,940
come to the committee very very late and

00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:48,830
when everybody is already you know had

00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,409
all particularly after a mediation

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,179
attempt has already been attempted and

00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,710
has failed because the committee then

00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,830
doesn't have any information to work on

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,869
and what we have is a series of

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:02,600
historical disputes about who said what

00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:04,600
to whom when but the committee doesn't

00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:09,399
have hasn't had the experience of

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:13,190
dealing with those people ourselves and

00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:15,080
so I think it would be most useful if

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,239
the Technical Committee could take on

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,940
more of that mediation role and this is

00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:21,379
something that we've not historically

00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,970
done very much of for a number of

00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:24,679
reasons one is there's this problem in

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,059
the Constitution that we're not supposed

00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:27,769
to have private conversations which

00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:29,200
obviously is very difficult you can't

00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:33,350
mediate unless you can talk to people

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,019
privately to both sides secondly there's

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,299
as you say there's a feeling that the

00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:40,580
maybe this is something that an elected

00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:42,919
person like the DPL would be would be

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,980
better to do and thirdly people just

00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:48,649
don't really ask it of us mostly maybe

00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,149
for the first two reasons so one of the

00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:51,950
things I'm trying to do with my proposed

00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:53,929
constitutional changes to make it easier

00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:56,149
for the technical imitating me d--ation

00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:57,379
and that's not to say that the DPL

00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:59,359
mediation is a bad idea

00:27:57,379 --> 00:28:04,600
I you know I'm looking forward to seeing

00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,600
that hopefully produce good results

00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:11,330
historically our in the project have

00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:13,759
procedures for dealing and processes for

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,989
dealing with interpersonal problems and

00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,909
various other kinds of problems haven't

00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:19,909
always been very good and it's good to

00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:22,179
see us trying out various different

00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:22,179
things

00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:39,980
so next question please I think someone

00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,830
raises hand before good it's not a true

00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,600
questions just we have an idea when you

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,880
will be able to make a decision on the

00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:51,320
who you will appoint as the new member

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,970
in the team yeah I have to take some

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,540
personal responsibility for the fact

00:28:52,970 --> 00:29:00,230
that this is taking so long

00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:03,470
the some time actually last year we

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,540
began a process of sort of looking for

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,910
you know possible new member for the

00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,500
committee and there actually multiple

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:13,340
people in the room whose names were

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:15,170
floated as possibilities for that and we

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,760
started off by saying okay that all the

00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,470
people whose names have been raised we

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,360
should begin by asking them if they

00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,550
would actually be interested before we

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,960
go and have some long discussion and

00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:29,930
debate about who would be the right

00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:32,000
person to ask and the the responsibility

00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,670
to do that fell on my shoulders I did

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,560
that we got answers from everybody and

00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:38,810
then things kind of came to a screeching

00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,840
halt for a couple of reasons that aren't

00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:46,640
important then we got into a situation

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,900
where as I said Minhaj chose to leave

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,970
the committee and that sort of

00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,010
distracted us for a little while and we

00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,900
started thinking again about this and

00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,270
then we had a DPL election and then

00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,850
quite frankly I've been a little

00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:00,880
distracted by the events in my personal

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,920
life for the last couple of months so

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,810
without going into a lot of details or

00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,580
anything I will take sort of personal

00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:10,280
responsibility for the fact that this

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,200
has been delayed for a while I think I

00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,700
think it is time for us in fact probably

00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,590
while we're here those of us that are

00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,420
here I'll talk about this some more but

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,820
in terms of actually coming to a

00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,160
decision I don't want to try and make

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,500
some hard assertion about it but it's

00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,060
back on my mind and we're all starting

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,830
to think and talk about it again so I

00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,740
would hope we'll get through that

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,640
process and actually invite you know

00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:35,290
additional member or two to the

00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:40,750
committee some time reasonably soon

00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:43,480
I think bond should also be aware that

00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:46,150
this is nothing but we need to have

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,770
fulfill to a certain day and say we need

00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,960
it definitely because otherwise we're

00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,790
not going to a continue working and what

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,860
we definitely want to do is you want to

00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:58,030
find someone who really fits in who

00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:02,110
makes our decisions better and it's a

00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:03,940
bit hard to it's not not as we all say

00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,760
well yes it's obvious this person's at

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,730
least we're going to take but different

00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,260
candidates have different advantages so

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,890
B&B are still at discussing which i

00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:17,110
think is also quite important on that

00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:19,240
you say fits in or possibly doesn't fit

00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,340
in because one of the things that we

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:25,780
could do with is more diversity in the

00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:30,550
committee so yeah I agree with what

00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:31,750
Colin just said but also I mean I take a

00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,210
slightly different view about this I

00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,640
think it's quite unfortunate that this

00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,370
has taken so long and as a member of the

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,350
committee and I bear some responsibility

00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:43,510
along with the rest of us for having let

00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,220
this sit undone for so long and I know

00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:48,400
that you know if you've had your name

00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,230
put forward you naturally wonder what

00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,270
has become of this do we not like you

00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,310
you know anything like that no I'm

00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:56,470
afraid that really there's there's

00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,000
there's no good answer to this than that

00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:01,440
we're just being a bit crap about this

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,260
and so our apologies

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,120
so it wasn't implying I'm happy about

00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,580
what's the current state so if someone

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,770
understood it that way it I'm I really

00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:16,060
think we should have been first and we

00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:19,750
are however it's let's say it's not it's

00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:21,310
not like set set as a long-standing box

00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,290
that we had that people were fighting

00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,570
about how to go on with certain things

00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:28,090
but yes which was finish this and I

00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,160
think the sooner the better and fit in

00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,660
also might mean for me is that we say

00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,460
okay we have some one person and

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,470
different abortion since which helps us

00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,090
to make our decisions better so fits in

00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:39,580
this not like it looks the same like

00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:43,030
everyone already on the committee so I

00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:46,050
hope to have clarified satnaam a bit so

00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,050
next question

00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:00,200
hello my name is Michael sniper Burke

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,970
and I'm actually one of the system the

00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,489
maintainer so naturally my question

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,769
centers around this earlier you've said

00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:08,599
that there are still things that need to

00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:10,489
be done before we can actually make a

00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:13,220
technical decision about system D

00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:15,499
whereas my current point of view is that

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,539
we could just flip the switch so let me

00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:23,720
just ask what are these things that need

00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:24,859
to be done before so yeah are you

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,659
proposing

00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:29,330
you see the thing is that I'm missing is

00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:31,700
that you don't seem to be as far as I

00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,950
know we're missing a kind of concrete

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:40,099
proposal in terms of are you proposing a

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:42,710
patch to policy for example those

00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:44,809
materials III haven't seen a proposed

00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:47,809
patch to the policy for example floating

00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:51,679
about is that if that's the stage that

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:54,279
you think you're at then I think you

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,090
should write that up and suggest it

00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:59,749
because that would give us something

00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,669
concrete to accept or reject but I

00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:03,590
really might suggest even if it's not

00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:06,049
not about your packages if that you look

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,480
in the backlog of lips a peg and see

00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:10,819
which kind of questions we ask to get it

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,349
what we really need to be able to decide

00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:14,179
on and I think is not only for us

00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:16,010
relevant to the site but always also for

00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,839
the blood checked so just as I purchased

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,529
and take a short look there and look at

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:23,289
the kind of questions we asked there

00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:30,710
okay thanks I think that clarifies it

00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:34,119
good so next question I mean this is for

00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,119
you to ask questions to us

00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:48,300
what would be a good level of frequency

00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,860
or a number of issues to be brought to

00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,690
the Technical Committee I mean do you

00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,790
think it just happens to magically

00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:57,149
perfect as it is or it should be used

00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,980
more well actually if you ask me I hope

00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:02,030
be happy if just ever the conflict for

00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:04,770
personal solve before it teletext to us

00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:06,990
yeah it's that's one of those questions

00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:10,350
it's like asking what's the good rate of

00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:12,900
test failures right to a one sense the

00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:14,430
good rate of test failures is 0 but if

00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,270
actually your test failure rate is zero

00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:19,970
it means your tests aren't working so

00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:22,170
you know if previously the rate of

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,910
referral issues the technical meaty was

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,080
very very low indeed and that was mostly

00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:28,470
because everybody knew that nothing

00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:31,650
would happen we've been a lot better

00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:37,410
recently we're making decisions more

00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:39,030
quickly sometimes very quickly I think

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,850
that's a good thing I would encourage

00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,560
people who have had you know if you have

00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:46,500
a problem that you think is is

00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,030
worthwhile and and that's not being

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,110
addressed properly please do bring it to

00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:53,730
the committee and I'm expecting that we

00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,910
will have to go through a continued

00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,470
increase in straightforward technical

00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,840
decisions a bit like the live JPEG one

00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,370
or the ones we've had recently and I

00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:07,460
think it would be healthy for us to deal

00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:09,510
with quite a few more of those so that

00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,980
because that excels kind of back

00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,160
pressure right if you're a maintainer

00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:17,280
and somebody disagrees with you having

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,900
the possibility that the person resume

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,920
we-we've will actually take you to the

00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,650
tech committee and you might be

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,210
overruled will be a useful thing that

00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,590
people might start to think about it at

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,990
the moment that's not really something

00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,370
that as a maintainer I myself as a

00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,170
maintainer don't really need to worry

00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,460
about the idea that somebody would

00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,170
disagree with me enough to take you to

00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:39,210
the committee and I wouldn't even get to

00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:41,820
vote on it myself so yeah I think it

00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,350
would be healthy if we have a higher

00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,750
rate than we have at the moment at least

00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,950
for a bit and if we start getting things

00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:51,090
that I think people should have been

00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:52,170
obvious well when we have had a one or

00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,700
two things that were brought to us

00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,900
recently where were the the answer was

00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,339
quite obvious and to be honest

00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,390
doesn't take a great deal of our time to

00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:03,359
dispose of something obvious I was going

00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:06,510
to say that I think I have sort of a

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,299
split personality about this because on

00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:11,160
one hand my personal mental model is

00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:13,049
that you take things to the Technical

00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,529
Committee when there's a failure of the

00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:18,930
ability to make a decision that everyone

00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:21,569
can live with without going in getting

00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:24,660
some higher 30 to do it for you

00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:27,630
and so as a developer I'm much more

00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,400
inclined personally to want to you know

00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,470
take a deep breath go off in a corner

00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,770
think about it and make a decision than

00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:37,440
I am to go sort of seek an overrule from

00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:40,289
from somebody else so that leads me to

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,059
believe that having a substantially

00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:43,770
larger number of questions come to the

00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,599
committee would somehow I mean that

00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:48,569
something somewhere else in our overall

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,730
project processes maybe was broken or

00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:52,230
not working as well as it could on the

00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:55,109
other hand as we've already talked about

00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,839
today I'd love to see a higher level of

00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:59,940
interaction between developers in the

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,480
project and the Technical Committee as a

00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:06,119
body and if that came in the form of

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,369
asking more questions or more advice on

00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,000
our mailing list or you know possibly

00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:14,369
taking advantage of us for you know some

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,329
mentoring and mediation in a private

00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:20,400
context if Ian's current proposal that's

00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,900
being floated actually sort of winds its

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,029
way all the way through the process or

00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,029
those sorts of things I'd be more than

00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:29,279
happy to see you know us as a group

00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:31,950
taking a more active role even if it's

00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:35,549
not in the form of having more bugs

00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:37,559
filed against us and answering more you

00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:40,140
know making more decisions that because

00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:43,910
other people are somehow failing to make

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:48,750
more of the decisions on a regular basis

00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:51,720
yeah I would I would follow up I guessed

00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:53,369
that by saying I would like the I would

00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,220
like the number of issues that are

00:38:53,369 --> 00:39:01,289
brought us to reflect the actual rate of

00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:03,359
failure and the projects so if it it

00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:04,740
doesn't it doesn't seem to me that the

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,350
number of things that are brought to us

00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:12,570
reflect the true

00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:15,540
extensive of dissents and while I would

00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:18,960
like there to be less dissent I would

00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:22,260
also like it to actually be making

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,060
progress the other thing is the the

00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:29,100
notion of back pressure is an excellent

00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:31,620
one I would if if the result of that

00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,860
were that developers put more effort

00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:38,670
into explaining things coherently

00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,290
and justifying their actions so I don't

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,030
want developers to have to justify every

00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:44,310
single thing they do but when when

00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:47,820
things get contentious people ought to

00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:49,920
be putting in some effort and in if

00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,740
they're if the result of a more active

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,030
technical committee was developers

00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,530
having to put in a bit more effort to

00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:59,580
explain what they're doing then I think

00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:01,950
I would be good for everybody we we

00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:05,040
would like to avoid too much failure and

00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,390
so obviously we prefer when people don't

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,000
have to go to the technical committee

00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:11,700
but I would like to suggest you maybe to

00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,450
get more to sit in the other direction

00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:17,490
maybe get more involved in the project

00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,860
on meaningless and discussions to avoid

00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:23,340
the problem before they come to the

00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:26,970
point where you have to join I mean if

00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:29,040
you look at what OS does I mean is

00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:31,800
helping a lot in driving forward some

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,530
important discussion or coming down when

00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,170
it comes down to problems and if one or

00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:39,330
two other members of the technical

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,060
committee could do the same I think it

00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:44,580
could really improve the atmosphere of

00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,120
this cushion the important case and even

00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,920
devil

00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:51,120
that's probably reasonable criticism of

00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:55,800
several of us myself included the I

00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:58,250
would like to avoid the perception that

00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,680
we're participating as members of the

00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:04,560
committee and thereby sort of squashing

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,100
the center or something but in general I

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,150
think that's wrong I think just about

00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:14,870
two minutes left now so it's enough

00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:18,300
ximena's left's also no further

00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:19,620
questions I think we could stop I think

00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,390
we could stop at this point

00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:28,760
no further questions we do okay

00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:28,760
okay well thank you thanks

00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:36,000
[Music]

00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,650
and I will just reiterate that we're all

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,180
here for the duration of the conference

00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,550
feel free if you have thoughts later on

00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,680
to come by and grab us and ask questions

00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,890
or or have more conversation thanks

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,890
again

00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:51,270
so thanks the dinner will be served in

00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,950
15 minutes

00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,950
