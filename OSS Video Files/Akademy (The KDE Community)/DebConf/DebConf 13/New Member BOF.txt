members of the team very soon indeed so

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,479

this year it's up to you ok so that's

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:50,460
what I wanted to do start with a bit of

00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,270
chatting about current things to break

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,030
the ice

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,369
describe the current status from the

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,360
things I'll tell you the things that the

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:04,259
Cabal knows and then tell you what the

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:12,989
Cabal needs and some more chart in the

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:13,920
end so show hands who has never heard of

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:25,200
the Debbie Newman

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:31,770
the process one okay who is involved in

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:35,850
the new Mendel process somehow okay is

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:37,890
there anyone going through the new

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:47,670
member process trying to get an account

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:56,989
here anyone who just got an account okay

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:56,989
you just joined okay

00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,760
I'm not sure I got the question are you

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:13,670
are you officially applied to become a

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:23,810
Debian developer not yet okay okay

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:23,810
application managers here one two two

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:33,109
actually we need more applicants than

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,109
application managers now

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:50,860
okay and we have former front desk

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:54,040
member yeah okay so and so the new

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,550
member poses for those who never heard

00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,520
of it

00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:03,850
is what happened what it's the it's the

00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:07,930
process about making people become

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:10,980
Debian developers a person applies to

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:15,010
become a Debian developer when they have

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,760
already experience with the project so

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,769
it's not about learning how to do Debian

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:25,360
work that is what they've been mentors

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:28,180
is for or other Debian teams are for but

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,410
there is a time after one has been

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:36,250
contributing for a while that perhaps we

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:40,960
would like to have their opinion in them

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:43,390
in elections and so or they would like

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,220
to you know be an official member of the

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:51,370
project get hot and you get mails from

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,260
Google recruiters every two weeks if you

00:04:51,370 --> 00:05:00,100
are in the list of Debian for even if

00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:03,070
you don't want you want that then it's

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,130
the new member process that decide okay

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,340
you can be a DD no you can't be a DD go

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,590
away perhaps you can be a DD but you

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:16,060
need to corrupt me with more beer or

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:18,460
something like that by the way i am not

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,300
corruptable with beer i rather more

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,830
enjoying wine and cheese

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:45,810
oh there was free wine and cheese all

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:49,110
night that's fantastic okay so for those

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:54,840
who are application managers how's it

00:05:49,110 --> 00:06:03,890
going right still waiting for new

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:07,020
applicants great nobody has a problem

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:10,950
three two one

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:15,230
excellent for those who are dealing with

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:23,160
an application manager there was none

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:25,290
okay no problems there excellent so for

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:31,760
those coordinating the whole process

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:39,810
instead things are pretty dire currently

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:44,210
so the way the process works is you say

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:47,280
you would like to be Debian developer

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,800
that can happen after you've done

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,230
uploads that can happen after you've

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,020
done any other sort of work in Debian

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:59,640
for a long enough time you know how the

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:01,710
community works and so okay you say I'd

00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:07,950
like to be a member an official member

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:10,560
of this community get ok and and and so

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:13,890
you get some existing Debian developer

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,990
to advocate you an existing app

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:19,920
developer that says well yes I believe

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,230
this person has enough knowledge about

00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:26,580
it that they can be Debian developers

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:30,120
right now so once that happens we have a

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,129
look to see if the Advocate was not

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,899
drunk at the time

00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:37,379
and perhaps we would like to see a

00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:42,059
little bit of sea the name of the person

00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:44,969
somewhere in Debian just doesn't came

00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:46,769
out of the blue or if it came out of

00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:49,199
nowhere then we would like to have a

00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:52,469
reason why maybe they were working for

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,330
NSA and they've done a lot of Secrets

00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:56,749
Debian work that would could not be

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,789
disclosed so we can be told

00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:04,949
confidentially about these things so

00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:08,459
once we are satisfied that one has some

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:10,619
experience then we assign an application

00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:13,949
manager to this person and the

00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:17,699
application manager has a long chat with

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:20,219
the applicant and the chap has several

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,429
questions they usually come from a set

00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:31,439
of templates for convenience but it's

00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:36,120
quite free what I hope the microphone

00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:40,459
don't tell people where the templates

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:45,060
are so they can you know have a look and

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:48,540
yes I really liked when I had an

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:52,920
applicant who was faster in answering

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:56,430
question than I was in asking and I

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,259
asked what the hell is going on and he

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,089
said that it was bored waiting for an

00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,740
application manager so it took the

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,480
templates and answered all the questions

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,420
and in was just copying and pasting and

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,899
I was like that's cool we got over the

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,490
whole thing in an afternoon and it was

00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:16,860
one of the fastest people to get an

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:21,779
account but the point that it's not an

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:24,480
exam if you think about it who would

00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:27,389
give you an exam where you can take your

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,589
time to answer questions from home with

00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:31,319
nobody watching you

00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:36,470
they internet at your disposal and you

00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:36,470
can ask people on IFC right

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:47,640
the point of the questions is to make

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:53,490
sure people had a look at several bits

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:56,400
of Debian we don't want to give accounts

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:59,970
to people that then have no idea how the

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:03,690
community works if you're not interested

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,850
in becoming a Debian developer but you

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,330
would like to know you would like to

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,670
know how the community works then get

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:17,550
the questions and answer them by

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:20,100
yourself it's a great way to put put

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,110
your knowledge to the test and and and

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,330
explore things that they're really good

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,550
pointers for exploration

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:30,600
once the application manager is

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:33,300
satisfied that a person should indeed be

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:38,279
a Debian developer then they click a

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:40,140
button on a website it used to be a lot

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,480
more work than that but now it's just

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:46,550
click a button on a website and I think

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,550
I deserve a little applause for that

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,930
click a button on a website ad and we'll

00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:58,660
fill in a text I take back the applause

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:02,709
you also need to fill in a text area say

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:09,579
that you liked that person and why but

00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:13,509
it still takes yeah but you click that

00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:15,759
button and then you say ok and now the

00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:20,050
front desk and ebon application manager

00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:23,829
will have a look front desk will have a

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:27,610
look to see if GPG signatures are valid

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:33,730
in males if there are no missing males

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:36,519
if the person has a key that is signed

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:40,800
by at least two Debian developers if the

00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:44,079
keys are at least 4,000 byte long and

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,019
some routine checks like that would

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,680
filter would kind of check the obvious

00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:54,490
and try to to fill in what's missing or

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:57,509
help people get a bigger key something

00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:00,370
like that once front desk is happy that

00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:03,339
there's nothing obviously missing they

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:06,279
pass it on to them that reads all the

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:11,529
conversation between the application

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:16,300
manager and the applicant and reads the

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:18,870
hook of the session and is like ok seems

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:22,139
like these people knew what was going on

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,139
click a button

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,900
[Music]

00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:35,019
click a button and then get text copy

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:39,040
text from a text area paste it in mud

00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:43,529
and then sign it in line submitted there

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,529
be an RT which will then take care of it

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:53,199
so those are steps now from desk with

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:59,339
time then the new member process got

00:12:53,199 --> 00:13:03,850
more tasks for example we now manage

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:07,750
collab mind access on ally of collab

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:10,480
mind is a repository like version

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:13,120
control system repository that all

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,199
Debian developers have commit access to

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,480
it and any other person can ask to have

00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,880
commit access on it and they just need

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,130
one Debian developer to say yes I would

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:29,199
like to work with this person on

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:31,899
something we also manage that so we get

00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:34,540
the requests and we need to go into the

00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:41,440
ally of g-force interface and click a

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:45,190
button to say yes and that's ok another

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,459
thing we do we manage we hand out guest

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:51,639
access to Debian machines for people who

00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:53,740
are not Debian developers so you suppose

00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,190
you maintain a package you are maybe

00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:00,310
Debian maintainer or just a sponsored

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:05,050
person and the package has a bug in some

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:09,040
weird architecture so you ask and you

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:11,019
can be given access to a debian machine

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,510
with data architecture so you can just

00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:17,769
log in and test your package and try to

00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:20,730
fix the bug we manage that as well we

00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:24,100
manage people who we're developers

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:27,490
before and retired but then they want to

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,029
come back so we also deal with that we

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:33,029
deal with people that stop existing for

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:36,100
the project without saying goodbye

00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:38,990
because they forgot or something and

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,649
then we interact with the Debian em

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:45,260
missing in action team two well close

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:48,589
the accounts or send a round of mails

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:52,100
saying are you still alive please say

00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:55,670
yes if you don't say yes then we'll

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,830
close your account which happens after

00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:02,839
one has been dead for the project for

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:09,770
like two years and we still ask are you

00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:16,270
dead anyway so we managed a lot of

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:20,149
things like that currently the team is

00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:22,149
the active part of the team is one

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:24,890
person doing front desk

00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:32,660
Jonathan will share that deserves a big

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:37,760
round of applause and from desk also

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:40,220
takes care of creating new people who

00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,720
apply and checking that everything is

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,700
fine and assigning them to an

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,600
application manager basically they do

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:50,209
all the work and Dom does all the rest

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,089
of the work which is basically applying

00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:55,459
common sense that damn is the person who

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,640
is trusted by the project and has the

00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:02,630
responsibility not to put silly people

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:06,709
into Debian most of the time we get it

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:09,860
right and we also have the

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:15,399
responsibility not to turn away saying

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:21,320
people which times it's more difficult

00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:24,709
but so firm desk takes care of some many

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:30,020
routine bits and Dom needs to read the

00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:34,310
whole discussion and make a decision I

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:40,100
have to say that because things function

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:41,300
really well now it's very unlikely that

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,839
some someone

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:49,279
I don't recall people being turned down

00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:51,800
in the last stage because now there are

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,950
ways to up an application manager will

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,400
realize that some

00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:58,620
one is not good and well there's big

00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:02,220
social changes happened so that people

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:05,040
are not anymore sort of force to approve

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:11,190
people or it would be a bad social thing

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:13,980
to do which is good so one person in

00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:17,000
front desk that handles people coming in

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:20,280
assigns them to application managers

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,670
checks that all the conversation is fine

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:27,630
deals with collab mine taxes deals with

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:30,390
guest accounts and possibly some more I

00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:46,290
blogged if you go in my blog there is a

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:51,450
list of specific can you put a link to

00:17:46,290 --> 00:18:00,060
that neither pad a link ok sorry yes

00:17:51,450 --> 00:18:09,530
definitely I'll put it here and you can

00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:09,530
move it okay I'll take away mine

00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:36,520
okay so that's the task of front-desk

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:39,610
the task of them the routine task that's

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,790
a routine task of front desk the routine

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,680
tasks of damn is to read through the

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:47,110
whole conversation between application

00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,740
managers and applicants and make a

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:57,160
decision then there's the non routine

00:18:50,740 --> 00:19:01,330
tasks I also and one from this member

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:05,950
one only one active damn doing routine

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:12,690
stuff which is me I need to rely well

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:12,690
sorry no no I can rely on gonna and mean

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:25,750
for emergencies or if I'm busy and so on

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:30,400
but they are busy I also am but I'm the

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:39,580
one that I'm the last one to join the

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:48,100
team so and the non routine things can

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:52,900
be complicated like controversial issues

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:58,920
with conflict going on in the project

00:19:52,900 --> 00:20:02,050
sometimes requires damn attention or

00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:05,730
well discussing about changing the rules

00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:11,740
making things better in a way or another

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:16,100
I also maintain an MDOT Debian org which

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:18,000
is the website coordinating all of it

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,870
[Music]

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,040
now it used to be the case that front

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:29,740
desk members were chosen among

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,420
application managers in the past it made

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,210
sense

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:39,820
from this member would review the work

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:43,720
of application manager however it

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:46,930
doesn't that is not true anymore

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:50,080
many of these tasks have nothing to do

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:53,910
with application managers so yesterday

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:57,700
we decided that any Debian developer

00:20:53,910 --> 00:21:00,880
provided they have some experience with

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:05,790
the project and they're reasonable

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,860
people can be a member of front desk and

00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:11,680
we would like to be able to split some

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,340
of these tasks and have maybe one person

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,440
to take care of one of them or two and

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:21,100
other people taking care of others so

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:25,560
the workflow the workload is less it's

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:28,660
easy stuff the commitment is not to have

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:35,410
long amounts of time but to be

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:38,290
responsive so maybe it's a case of 20

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:43,380
minutes Alf an hour every day or two

00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,380
rather than one day a week doing things

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:55,510
and and that's from the front desk site

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:57,460
to have new dams well one needs to be in

00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:01,240
to have been in to front desk for a

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:04,780
while before being done now that is a

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:09,070
problem because we currently have only

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:17,050
one possible dam candidate which means

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:22,690
that things are fragile I would like to

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:27,010
get quite a bit well two or three from

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:31,750
these members and see where it goes

00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:35,830
so that at there is a chance of things

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:38,200
moving on and the team evolving and I'd

00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:42,520
like to be in a team where turnover is

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,590
possible I am myself I don't like to do

00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,080
routine tasks that much

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:52,749
reading the conversations is interesting

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:54,940
but the way I work I like to get into

00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:58,360
somewhere where there is a problem try

00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:00,009
to fix the problem do some routine tasks

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,320
for a while to see that the situation

00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:06,999
really got better and then move on to

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,809
another problem I I am NOT fixing new

00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:10,990
problems

00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:13,830
indeed I am NOT fixing problems in nm

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,360
and I haven't been for many months

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:19,960
exactly because all my energy is taken

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:23,830
by the routine tasks and that I lose a

00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,159
bit of motivation because of that so the

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:32,769
team is slowly losing health and sanity

00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:42,690
and we need new blood and souls and Tulu

00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:42,690
essences here and so join our come and

00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:52,779
yeah now in order to one thing to be in

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:55,919
front desk you need to hang out in the

00:23:52,779 --> 00:24:01,119
secret Kabbalah SH IRC channel of doom

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:04,419
where everything is discussed so a front

00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,879
desk member will read also the

00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:11,110
discussion between dams for

00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:17,320
controversial or private issues so there

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:22,419
needs to be some level of trust but if

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:24,629
you've been DD for a while and nothing

00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:29,499
controversial has happened I guess

00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:32,139
that's fine unless usually flaming

00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:35,440
mailing lists in that case perhaps we

00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:42,909
don't want to have you around but who

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:45,669
knows so if you are interested in taking

00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:52,769
care of something like that do come and

00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:52,769
talk to me afterwards now

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:08,990
we are quite okay with application

00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:12,290
managers but feel free to become one if

00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:14,600
you want to try it's an interesting

00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,480
experience it means you don't need to

00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,280
read them in the commentation anymore

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,230
people you can just ask a person and

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:29,570
that person will have to find out

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:33,140
information for you however you need to

00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:35,090
check if the information what ya

00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,300
provided that you find an applicant then

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:42,980
new job for application managers finding

00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:46,210
new applicants however we need to check

00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:49,430
that the answer is correct which means

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:53,800
did some great way to refresh your

00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:58,340
knowledge of things so yeah that's fun I

00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:01,520
don't quite know what happens with why

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:04,700
we have lots of free AMS and not many

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,870
applicants perhaps the pod the whole

00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,730
thing is just healthy and an am

00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:13,310
procedure became so much quicker that

00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:16,610
people get free faster or can handle

00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:19,070
more applicants but I would need to ask

00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,840
Jonathan about it because I haven't been

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,350
taking care of that side of it for a

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,350
while now

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:29,120
there's also need for help with the

00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:31,420
website maintenance and MDOT Debian dot

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,420
org

00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:54,660
this is the website and in the bottom of

00:26:52,680 --> 00:27:00,540
the website it says source code is

00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:07,320
available you click on available and you

00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:21,060
get it and you in the source code there

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:24,750
is there is getting started file which

00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:29,310
tells you how to set up the whole thing

00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:32,250
in your machine there is even a function

00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:36,960
in the website text that exports the

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:40,800
full a full dump of the database which

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:45,600
is anonymized so personal details are

00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:48,630
taken out and that can be used to set up

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,880
a working database in your machine to

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,980
test things and the working database

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,670
will be almost exactly what is on the

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:59,010
website except there's some la-la-la in

00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:01,410
in comments about people because well

00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:06,480
unless your front desk member in that

00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:09,360
case you get the whole thing with asked

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,580
front desk members a lot and that is

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,570
also a good way after a while you've

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:18,230
been in front desk even just to do a

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:23,070
trivial thing like a proving collab mind

00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:25,350
requests then you have a very good idea

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:28,980
about what goes on because you see all

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:32,370
other discussions it's a very good way

00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:38,040
to get more involved with with new

00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:40,980
member process and we value ideas from

00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,630
new founders members just if there's

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,000
discussion about some controversial

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:49,560
issue maybe don't try to push for your

00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,910
solution too much because it would make

00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:56,999
the discussion quite difficult but still

00:28:52,910 --> 00:29:04,679
it's a rather open

00:28:56,999 --> 00:29:07,259
close there see Channel so I have some

00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:14,039
small tasks if you the website is

00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:18,959
written in Django so if you know Python

00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:21,869
and Django it's some rather simple

00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:23,759
jungle model behind it if you know

00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:27,989
Python and Django and would like to try

00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:33,899
and hack on it I do have some small

00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:36,809
tasks you can try to do and if you can

00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:41,449
manage to do one of them you can cross

00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:49,799
the bridge and you know join the team

00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:53,969
developing on the site do you need to be

00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:57,259
DD to work on on the site or not you

00:29:53,969 --> 00:30:00,449
don't need to be led to work on the site

00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:01,949
you can ask DD to give you a dump of the

00:30:00,449 --> 00:30:05,339
database

00:30:01,949 --> 00:30:07,649
I trust that DDS wouldn't give dumps to

00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:09,869
anyone and at least they would know that

00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:13,289
they give a dump to a person that

00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:15,749
wouldn't disclose the list of emails of

00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:17,189
all Debian developers for example which

00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:19,139
is pretty much the only sensitive

00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:30,359
information you get at that point but

00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:33,539
still right private emails because when

00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:35,759
you apply you you put which email you

00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:40,199
want your Debian email forwarded to and

00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:42,419
that that's in the LDAP dump if you are

00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:45,989
a DD but you don't see it if you are not

00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:50,999
a DD and I don't have a problem if an

00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:53,489
only D would see it but then a DD should

00:30:50,999 --> 00:31:00,209
take responsibility kind of for it

00:30:53,489 --> 00:31:02,339
not to give it to random people and I

00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:05,489
have a question about that yeah I know

00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:07,919
I'm why it seemed like it would be

00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:10,650
better if the DB export simply removed

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,580
those so then it could be completely

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:18,030
fine for anyone to download it yeah I

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:20,910
haven't done a proper audit on what else

00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:24,870
can be inferred from that done I've done

00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:27,510
it a bit in a hurry so unless that's

00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:33,390
kind of proper audited I don't feel like

00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:37,020
making it public so yeah anyone can do

00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:40,520
it but you Pauline it's best if you are

00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:43,230
a DD before joining the D IRC channel

00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,260
but who knows

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,660
honestly although if you end up being in

00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:51,720
the front desk IRC channel doing active

00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,940
positive work with enough common sense

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,910
to understand what goes on and making

00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:02,130
good calls possibly somebody would ask

00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:06,170
you why not DD yet and maybe that's a

00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,820
good way to become a DD very fast indeed

00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:11,550
[Music]

00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:13,470
but yeah the website is there the the

00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:15,990
code is there you can get a dump you can

00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:18,480
run it in your machine I can share my

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:21,810
to-do list with you which basically

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,880
means also explaining what this stuff I

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:36,960
wrote in it actually mean because it's a

00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:38,190
bit of a mess this is Enrico while

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,720
you're fiddling with your computer and

00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,000
one more question / suggestion

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,510
yeah can you can I suggest that you

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,940
schedule bath that's even more casual

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,500
than this for people who want to set up

00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:56,970
a development instance and quiz you

00:32:49,500 --> 00:33:00,450
about that like in Penta you mean mmm

00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:02,600
website hacking yes how many people how

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:06,150
many people would be interested in that

00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:10,430
one two three four five that's a lot

00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:15,480
more than zero seven awesome yes

00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:18,589
consider it settled okay when is it

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,589
[Music]

00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:34,300
let's anonymize I in my totally stay put

00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:36,550
IFC dumps for people submitting ideas so

00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,620
that I also remember who I need to tell

00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,210
I've actually done it and they would

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,660
usually go when did I ask you that and

00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:46,660
I'm like perhaps two years ago oh cool

00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:49,769
but yeah this is an example of

00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,769
[Music]

00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:12,440
multiple exclamation marks are a sure

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:17,599
sign of a diseased mind okay

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:20,629
so such incredible things as when you

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,879
advocate a Debian maintainer to be a

00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:25,040
Debian developer automatically check

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,200
that you want that person to have upload

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,569
rights

00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:34,339
it currently defaults to non uploading

00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:37,359
yeah that there's a few things to fix

00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:41,869
like that which are probably very good

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:44,560
or improved the weekly report that is

00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:47,270
sent the Debian new member mailing list

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,750
that sort of things would be really

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:53,329
helpful so further discussion about an

00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:56,540
MDOT them in the org delayed to the

00:34:53,329 --> 00:35:02,450
awesome and end of the mid org hacking

00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:09,440
both coming soon so we can go to the

00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:12,500
last bit which is question and answer

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:20,900
not Quality Assurance brainstorming

00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:24,410
proposals and more chat questions okay

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:27,859
well I have a question so you wanted

00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:32,270
volunteers for front desk and maybe for

00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:35,060
application managers is that right is

00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,960
not that urgent okay anything else well

00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,530
you don't need to be an application

00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:45,020
manager to be in front desk so yeh so

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:46,700
front desk and website hacking so I have

00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,140
a question for everyone then is there

00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,640
anyone in the room who is a Debian

00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,099
developer who's interested in being on

00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,990
the front desk now's a great time to

00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:56,930
raise your hand higher higher come on

00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:59,319
come on I can see you right there one

00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,319
two

00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:07,480
the question is how how long have you

00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:11,440
had to have been a Debian developer

00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:15,490
right yes exactly it used to be the case

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:18,670
that in order to be an application

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:21,579
manager you needed to be a new so you

00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:26,349
needed to be a DD for at least six

00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:28,539
months which was killing everything

00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:30,970
because you wanted to be an application

00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:33,640
manager when you just out of the process

00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,559
and you clearly remember what was going

00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:39,880
on and the process was a part of your

00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:41,770
life so we wait six months well to get

00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,900
you involved in everything else in

00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,520
Debian except the new member process and

00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:53,410
then we are like would you like to come

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:55,780
back on the other hand that is something

00:36:53,410 --> 00:37:00,160
from the past when we assumed that

00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:02,230
people who were not they've been

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,720
developer had no experience in Debian

00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:06,730
now we require people to have experience

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,599
in Debian before becoming they've been

00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:13,960
developers so I would be okay relaxing

00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:16,990
six months requirements like that we did

00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,420
not talk about it with the other dams so

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:24,299
I would like to run that through the

00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:28,599
others before saying cool no problem but

00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:33,789
yeah okay and riku party but it's not

00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:37,029
fair to ask them to reply right now but

00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:39,250
I would definitely yeah and Ricky but

00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:41,559
you asked for the front desk so I was

00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,109
asking back how mature do you have to be

00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:46,660
a sidd before you can help with the

00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:50,140
front X people yeah the general idea

00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:52,270
that if we ask six months of experience

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,180
before being application managers then

00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:58,539
we should probably ask two years before

00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:02,529
being front desk but why should somebody

00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:08,230
be such an old seasoned developer in

00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:13,089
order to check that some GPG signature

00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:14,020
is okay and click a button on g-force on

00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:19,300
a yacht

00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:21,100
right there's not much point on it so I

00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:25,360
would think there wouldn't be a problem

00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:27,310
but okay so again if replied basically

00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:33,850
70 checks of new minish members stay

00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:35,980
anyways so yeah works works they stay

00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:39,820
anyways so that's what he's saying so he

00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:44,619
says it's not really pieces we don't

00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:46,360
need to defined waiting time now that's

00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:50,250
gonna saying there's no need for the

00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:52,630
find waiting time okay cool yeah okay so

00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:54,880
let's talk afterwards

00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,320
I asked you else with interested in

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,300
being part of front desk

00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,830
can I get you guys to rate guys and

00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,600
Ghandour gals to raise your hands and

00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:04,420
have somebody else write down your login

00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,369
names please I'm completely serious

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,750
please do that again raise your hands

00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:08,850
raise your hand you're excited who else

00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:13,780
was there

00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:17,290
what's somebody write down your login

00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:24,670
name what's your login name okay great

00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:30,850
who else was there Yann Dede okay at

00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:36,250
least into the audio okay okay yeah

00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:38,020
Daniel wdg also what wdg is another

00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:44,670
username that you should add to your

00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:54,330
perspective front desk yours okay oh

00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:54,330
okay cool okay more questions

00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:03,730
more ideas for improving things used to

00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,890
be a big one in the past now it's

00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:09,880
obviously perfect nothing to improve any

00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:14,099
more problems you recently had already

00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:19,420
asked that before so yes what

00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:22,630
so the besides getting new people to

00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,519
help what you are saying is that the

00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:36,220
Debian new member process is currently

00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:39,759
perfect so if not I'm using Debian since

00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,920
2000 and in the meantime I got the

00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:44,140
impression that becoming a TT is

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,740
something really hard and you should

00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:51,450
think really well about it before you

00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:54,249
apply and now I take it as a positive

00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:58,440
development that I'm actually encouraged

00:40:54,249 --> 00:41:01,450
right ly and this was just a remark

00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,869
maybe some other members of the audience

00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:07,509
have this idea of well I should really

00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:09,999
be really good before I start to apply

00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:11,710
and maybe that's not the case anymore

00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:14,759
maybe we should incur or you do

00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:17,759
encourage you should be really good

00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:17,759
indeed

00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:25,730
that if you if you are still learning

00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:27,130
then mentors is the place to go but

00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:33,110
[Music]

00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:37,460
because if the nm process is about

00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:42,140
teaching people then things take ages it

00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:45,970
should just be about okay you know your

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:49,880
stuff or you know where to find things

00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:52,910
cool you do or you don't do things

00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:58,160
without knowing what you're doing

00:41:52,910 --> 00:42:00,710
actually about knowing what to do it

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,900
would be a great thing too for new

00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:05,780
member applicants to get a good idea

00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,880
what is to know your stuff quite well

00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:10,460
because I've talked to many different

00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,200
people who said yes of course you should

00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,290
become a DD you're ready now there's

00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,810
people who say no you aren't so I think

00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:21,560
I would be a good thing to have some

00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:24,380
guidelines to look at to say okay I

00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,960
can't do it or I cannot until now if

00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,580
it's just about the questions I already

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,340
answered all the questions I looked them

00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:34,190
up and stuff and that so I think for

00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,840
many people asking themselves am I ready

00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:40,760
it would be a good thing to have

00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:44,840
guidelines that is I would be interested

00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:49,220
in doing it but there is rule that says

00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:53,230
that if somebody is ignorant there is no

00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,230
way for them to realize their ignorance

00:42:53,740 --> 00:43:01,760
yes I'm not pointing this question for

00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:04,130
overconfident people but to under

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,990
confidence oh okay you never will get

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:09,350
out of the overconfident people and I

00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:11,960
think an application manager will

00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:14,930
quickly notice these because they start

00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,300
the process and all on the people who

00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:21,290
really ask sorry ask themselves if I am

00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:24,700
ready will positive never really come to

00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:30,470
the conclusion yes I am now good point

00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:32,720
help needed also for documentation it

00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:35,420
in an appalling state because the

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,100
process has changed so much recently

00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:40,360
that we could just couldn't cope with

00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:46,100
keeping documentation up-to-date so

00:43:40,360 --> 00:44:06,200
that's also volunteers needed how do we

00:43:46,100 --> 00:44:18,970
deal with that well in perspective no

00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:22,370
idea what tasks of advocate so to ask

00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:34,490
because I don't know if it's it's just

00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:38,690
just saying that takes effort click a

00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:41,720
button on a webpage and answer to it if

00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:43,280
one is clicked it too fast I'm afraid

00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,870
time is up but I will say that anyone

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,340
who wants to help a documentation in my

00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:49,670
opinion should show up to the website

00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,020
hackfest also thanks again to enrico for

00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,650
starting this and to everyone for asking

00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,640
great questions

00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,820
