	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,569
here as SPI board members and they will

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,080
talk about the current ongoing

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:14,429
activities for SPI and then a lengthy

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,560
Q&A session so thank you

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,119
great thank you very much and thanks

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,090
everybody for for coming this afternoon

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,970
to talk with us about software in the

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,099
public interest to be very clear we have

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,619
a few slides to set a little bit of

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,099
context and provide some sort of

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,630
starting point or background information

00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:35,940
but this is meant to be a birds of a

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,920
feather session not to be a presentation

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,140
so I'm gonna try and go through the

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,910
slide material fairly quickly with a

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,969
little bit of help from Jimmy to in

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,620
various places where I may be a little

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,289
jet lag still and not remembering all

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,110
the details but then we very much would

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,820
like to open up to questions fairly

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,149
quickly and spend most of our time in

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,190
that regard I am B Dale Garvey I serve

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,370
as president of software in the public

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,400
interest we just went through another

00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:07,549
board election cycle and following that

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,659
at the most recent board meeting

00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,659
re-elected the existing slate of

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,850
officers to serve for another year so

00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:17,909
that's a fresh appointment and I'll have

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,460
the office of president for at least

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,799
another year and I guess we have three

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,299
year board terms so beyond the board for

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,520
a while yet in terms of what I want to

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,770
do today we want to just briefly review

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,799
who the board members and officers are I

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,810
think actually this is the smallest

00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,939
percentage of the SPI board of directors

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,610
that's actually been present at DEFCON

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,320
in a number of years that's partly due

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,360
to just people's conflicting life

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,590
schedules but also it has something to

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,280
do with the fact that we are slowly

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,200
expanding the board participation to

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,689
have more folks from outside of Debian

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,880
which is I think a great thing I'll talk

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,360
just a little bit about where SPI came

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,579
from and what its purpose is we've had a

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,399
number of new Associated projects join

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,320
in the last year so the slides full of

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,050
logos have gotten an even denser than

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,450
they were in the past

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,420
we'll talk a little bit about financial

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,800
status and a couple of very specific

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,360
recent events that I think are

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,860
interesting and then as I said I want to

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,780
spend most of the time on questions and

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,980
answers so this is the current

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,590
membership of the board

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,980
despite this going through an election

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,440
cycle

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,840
I believe everybody that was running for

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,610
re-election was in fact reelected aim

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,110
what if that yeah yeah so there's no

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,390
change in the board since last year

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,850
Jimmy and I are who are the non

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,030
italicized names are the two folks who

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,530
are present here at DEFCON and certainly

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,870
the for the rest of the week even

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,220
outside of this BOP session if you have

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,410
things you'd like to talk to us about

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,760
regarding suffering the public interest

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,170
please feel free to come by and find us

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,210
several of the other folks I suspect are

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,460
following along on the stream and

00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:00,790
perhaps available on IRC if questions

00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,680
should come up but this is who the

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,830
current board members are and I won't

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,320
belabor that any more what is software

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,630
in the public interest we are a

00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,310
nonprofit organization based in the

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,800
United States that was originally

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,670
created to provide a legal and financial

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:23,380
existence for the Debian project in the

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:25,360
US since the folks who started suffering

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,510
the Public Interest had a broader vision

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,310
the organization was created in such a

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,280
way that it can provide services not

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,290
just a debian but to any substantial and

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,300
significant free software project that

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:42,610
seems to meet our objectives and whose

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,890
activities are aligned with those that

00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:49,360
we believe are appropriate for an SPI

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:52,450
associated project at this point from a

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,310
Debian perspective SPI is one of a

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,570
number of different organizations around

00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,400
the world that hold money and other

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:03,190
assets tangible assets on behalf of the

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,320
Debian project if you are for example a

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,360
citizen of the United States and you

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,980
want to make a contribution to a project

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,410
like Debian or any of our other

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,020
associated projects that may be tax

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:17,450
advantages to doing that through SPI

00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,040
and conversely for folks outside of the

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,989
United States there are other

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,470
organizations that act as fiscal

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:26,300
sponsors for an project that might be

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,180
more appropriate depending on tech

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,040
situations in the different countries

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,810
and it's not all just about money there

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,910
are other assets that we hold on behalf

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,950
of Debian and other projects that can

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,980
include things like domain name

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,880
registrations logos and so forth we

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,940
don't currently actually hold title to

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,040
any or many physical assets but there's

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,360
no reason we couldn't if that were an

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,970
important thing for us to do on behalf

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:58,610
of a project SBI was started back in

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,790
1997 and was organized in the state of

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,750
New York in the United States in 1999 we

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:09,010
were declared a 501 C 3 nonprofit

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:12,500
corporation this is the category that is

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:14,450
it's one of several designations in the

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,900
United States that can be appropriate

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,630
for a non-profit that's serving free

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,550
software projects it's without

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,460
belaboring the point it turns out that

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,530
there are a few limitations at places on

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,550
what we can do with money that's donated

00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:34,460
through SPI that none of those have so

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,980
far substantially impacted our ability

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,750
to serve the projects that we provide

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,910
services to and as I've already

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,940
mentioned while SPI was originally

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,820
created to serve a need that the Debian

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,740
project had that need turns out to be a

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,950
need that's common among many free

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,920
software projects and SPI has now grown

00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:57,830
to have a really significant and diverse

00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,990
list of associated projects here's the

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,030
first of a couple of slides with logos

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,760
of the various projects that are now

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,830
associated with SPI what ends up

00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,260
happening is if there's a free software

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:13,130
project that needs assistance of the

00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:15,020
kind that SPI can provide some project

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,470
will approach one or more members of the

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,260
SPI board asking if they can become an

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,960
Associated project we have a process

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,520
that we go through of explaining to them

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,440
sort of what we can do what we can't do

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,960
what the rules are

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,229
that

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,569
leads to either agreeing that something

00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:34,830
else would be a better approach or if it

00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:37,199
looks like they would be a good

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,199
candidate for an associated project

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,210
status we'll write a resolution we'll

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,639
put that before our contributing members

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,139
for discussion for a period of time and

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,419
then we'll vote on it in one of our

00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,669
board meetings and these are all

00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:53,099
projects that over time we have voted to

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:56,729
invite to associated project status

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:58,380
here's the second batch of logos in fact

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:01,820
this slide has several of the ones that

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:06,630
have been recent additions openembedded

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:09,449
tied SDK 0 ad what else is on here oh

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:13,080
the open bioinformatics foundation I

00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:15,630
guess it's called and I'm sure I'm

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,360
forgetting some but there's a there's a

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,909
Malayalam language related project off

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,360
on the right way with P curls right

00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:26,460
right I think that maybe all of the new

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,409
associated projects in the last year but

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,870
I'd have to go back and look on our

00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:32,280
website there is a projects page that

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,560
has a list of all the currently

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,020
associated projects with links to their

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,720
project websites and their logos and

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,310
brief textual descriptions of what their

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,650
projects are about and so forth if you'd

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,620
like to learn more the real message from

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,479
all of this is that SPI is now doing a

00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,150
lot of stuff for a lot of projects not

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,759
just for Debian but in the process we

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,050
have of course tried to make sure that

00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,639
all the things we're doing we're doing

00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,070
at least as well for Debian as we are

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,780
for anybody else since that's Debian's

00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,210
the organization that caused us to come

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:06,240
into existence and that you know many of

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,849
us who are on the board probably would

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,599
most closely associate ourselves with as

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:13,320
the project that we work on out of SPI

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,330
so there are a couple of recent

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,210
activities that I think are worth

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,430
specific mention one is that in

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,500
recognition of the fact that as we

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,750
continue to grow and as our transaction

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,419
volume has gone up we've really gotten

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,639
to the point where expecting volunteers

00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:32,039
to manage all of the transaction

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,190
processing and to do all of the roles

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,440
that are required of our treasurer is

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,320
just not appropriate we've just

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,479
completed the process of

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,620
searching for bookkeeping firm we've

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,990
selected a firm and I expect some time

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,610
this month actually the initial meetings

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,620
will happen with that firm to set up the

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,430
processes by which they'll begin to take

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,770
over handling our ever-increasing

00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:00,860
transaction flow this is kind of a big

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:03,110
step in the evolution of SPI we have

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,930
flirted in the past with outside

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,330
bookkeeping firms but I think we have

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,820
this time a more significant commitment

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,190
on the part of the board to have this be

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,800
a successful transition and to get out

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,380
of the mode of expecting volunteers to

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,870
do all of the grunt work associated with

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:25,220
the financial processing for SPI and its

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:27,260
associated projects related to that one

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,540
of the problems we've run into is that

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,640
trying to find a bookkeeper whose

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,340
processes we could actually interface

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,870
with has been really really challenging

00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,410
and part of the reason for this is if

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:41,660
you don't know let me just tell you that

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:45,020
there's no financial software in the

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:48,440
world that is within the sort of

00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,050
reasonable price range that's available

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,510
to handle the specialized needs of a

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:57,170
fiscal sponsor nonprofit organization

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:59,720
like SPI that includes big books it

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,310
doesn't handle this yeah all of the sort

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,490
of things that people think of is the

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,410
standard tools for managing finances of

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,860
corporations or small businesses or

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,550
whatever just don't comprehend some of

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:15,200
the special needs of a fiscal sponsor

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,840
organization like ours where in effect

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,290
we're running a hierarchical set of

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,120
books because we're managing you know

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,590
financial transaction records for a

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,710
bunch of projects each one of which

00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:30,740
looks kind of like a little company and

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:32,480
you can completely broke trying to buy

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,580
your way into really expensive

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,070
proprietary software solutions that you

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:40,490
would still have to modify enhance and

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,470
customize we can do what we which was to

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,590
agree to collaborate with the software

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:49,760
freedom Conservancy they have a project

00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:51,709
or they proposed a project to try and

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,870
solved this problem by building a

00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:57,110
software solution specifically meeting

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,480
the needs of fiscal sponsor nonprofit

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,730
organizations like our respective

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,430
organizations and to do it a hundred

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:07,279
percent with free software they set a

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,410
statement of work a set of objectives we

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,690
looked at it it looks pretty reasonable

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,060
and it would actually be very helpful to

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,790
us as an organization if that were to be

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,769
a successful project and so at our last

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,230
board meeting we voted to make our first

00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:25,149
ever financial grant from SP eyes

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:27,589
general fund which is the fund that we

00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:29,899
sort of skim a little bit of the

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,670
donations all of our associated projects

00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:34,279
to use for covering our costs of

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,440
operation and so forth and we've been so

00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,870
frugal over the years and done so much

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,700
with volunteer labor that that general

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:43,550
fund has just sort of been growing and

00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,980
so we decided that spending ten thousand

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,649
dollars making a grant to try and help

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,329
aid the development of a completely free

00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,690
software solution to solving the

00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:55,670
financial where problem that we and

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,040
other organizations like us have was a

00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,630
good idea hope you'll agree with us that

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,730
that was a good thing to do with some of

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,459
that money I get that this was the

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,579
closest to a split gen vote that we've

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:10,670
had on the board in awhile with people

00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:12,079
choosing to abstain from the vote but in

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,250
the end I think it was a good thing to

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:19,730
do and I hope going forward that it also

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,260
mentioned this will like once we do you

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,000
know proceed through all these

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,550
transitions and have a solution like

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,560
this up and running and even to a lesser

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,899
degree in the interim with the

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,970
bookkeeping firm you know having these

00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:34,640
records done in a more systematic and

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,070
appropriate way will in the future make

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,699
things like giving Debian access to its

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:43,220
own records a lot easier to do and other

00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:46,279
things that an organization like FBI

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,540
should be able to do as it grows yeah

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,490
it's sort of interesting we've just

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,199
gotten to the point where the ability to

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,199
continue to scale mostly manual

00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:55,760
processes has completely been exceeded

00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:57,649
and it's time for us to just do things

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,750
differently and to sort of put that

00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:00,960
point home here's the financial

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,880
statement as

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,770
the end of June in terms of the assets

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,330
that were holding in trust I don't know

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,920
how easy this is to read from the back

00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,360
of the room so those of you who decided

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,600
the back of the room was a good choice

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,340
you know who on you but the bottom line

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,770
numbers here is we're holding just over

00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,020
four hundred and twenty-three thousand

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:22,200
dollars a u.s. in trust for the various

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:24,240
associated projects as of the end of

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,790
June the largest balance was actually

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,530
held on behalf of Debian the second

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,590
largest was on behalf of Libre Office

00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:33,660
and the third largest was the Deb comp

00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:36,090
13 year mark so I'm sure that some of

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,430
that money has been used or transferred

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,200
or at least committed to be transferred

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,860
in support of this conference since the

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,690
end of June the July report is not

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,180
available yet that's why I'm showing you

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,340
the end of June numbers but in addition

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,250
to that our general reserves had grown

00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:55,710
to a little over 56,000 dollars which is

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,620
the reason we thought making a $10,000

00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:00,600
grant was completely reasonable because

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,390
the new expenses will be incurring for

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,140
bookkeeping our you know gonna be on the

00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:08,580
order of five or six thousand dollars a

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,260
year or something to pay for those

00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,330
bookkeeping services if I remember the

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,130
numbers correctly so that reserve will

00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:18,540
still be completely sufficient to help

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:20,340
meet our sort of ongoing expenses well

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,970
into the future are there any questions

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:26,310
about these financial balances or

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,900
anything related to those recent

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:33,780
activities that I can answer before we

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:36,600
go on okay one interesting thing to

00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:39,360
mention is just the sheer breadth of how

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,650
many projects hold substantial sums the

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,340
number there's a large number of

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:46,320
projects in the list that have five

00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,800
figures like over ten thousand dollars

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,990
and so it gives an idea of the broad

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,940
scope it's not just debian even if that

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,590
being is the largest number it's not

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,720
even the only Linux distribution that

00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,610
has a substantial a balance I also

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,000
mention the open bioinformatics as a

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,650
recently a recent addition to our list

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,210
of associated projects and they sort of

00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:09,360
showed up with you know over thirty

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:11,010
seven thousand an asset so another

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,600
recent development that actually we

00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,420
didn't talk about before but you're

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,900
certainly aware

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,450
a software development contract one of

00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:23,440
our project at the top zero ad they're a

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:25,240
game related project and we had to pay

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,220
attention to do it carefully to make

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,940
sure that it would comply with all the

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,960
relevant legal and tax rules but they

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,000
are actually you know funding some

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:40,270
development with the developer in in

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,390
Eastern Europe to make some changes for

00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,040
pay on on their project and once we made

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,750
sure that we were going to you know

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,520
comply with all the relevant rules we

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,070
were excited and happy to facilitate

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,780
that yeah it's an example of something

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,400
we've told people in the past in our

00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,020
various associated projects we're

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,030
willing to do but we just haven't had

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,430
anybody that had pulled the trigger on

00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,930
doing something quite like that so lots

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,240
of things have been happening that are

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,250
so interesting they're not hugely

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,770
visible because their interactions

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:12,460
between SPI and specific associated

00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:13,900
projects but it feels to me like things

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,960
have actually been going reasonably well

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,670
recently though we completely recognized

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,010
that we had reached the point with the

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,330
financial transaction processing volume

00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,460
where as I mentioned you know the

00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,960
processes we were using are just not

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,110
appropriate anymore and that's why we're

00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,060
making those changes so in terms of SPI

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,470
membership anyone who agrees with the

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,750
principles of software in the public

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:38,020
interest is eligible and encouraged to

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,400
apply for membership those of you and

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,740
certainly Act I would assume that

00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,540
anybody in the room at the moment would

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,400
qualify for a contributing member ship

00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,320
because the requirement for that is that

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,570
you need to be active participating

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:53,020
actively in the free software community

00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:55,180
in some way certainly if you're a DD or

00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,440
a DM within the Debian project it would

00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,140
be clear to us that you would

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,270
immediately qualify and I don't mean to

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,740
exclude other contributors to Debian but

00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:06,940
those are ones that I'm sure we would

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:08,620
instantly say yes obviously and once you

00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,690
become a contributing member the only

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,240
additional sort of thing that happens is

00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,850
you get the right to vote in our board

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,110
of directors elections every year

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:20,200
doesn't sound like a really big deal but

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:22,210
I'm actually strongly encouraging more

00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,490
participants from more of our associated

00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,570
projects the seat contributing member

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,310
status so that as we

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:30,500
you know our annual board elections in

00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,630
the future I'd love to see more

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,570
candidates from more of The Associated

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,550
projects have a higher probability of

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,770
being able to be successfully elected to

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,640
the board because I think in continuing

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:45,020
to increase the diversity of the

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,970
projects that people come from if you

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,880
will for the board members would be a

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,770
healthy thing for SPI in the future and

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,140
if you're interested that's the URL to

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:58,880
chase to go find out about membership if

00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:01,700
you aren't it's also really unusual in

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,610
the u.s. nonprofit or free software

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,710
nonprofit communities to have a fully

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:10,360
elected board accountable to the

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,800
membership that it represents most

00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:17,150
nonprofits in both categories there are

00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,500
exceptions like KDE I think but the

00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,950
Apache Software Foundation the Free

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,910
Software Foundation the Eclipse offer

00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:27,440
you know etc most of the other ones and

00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,240
almost any US charity there is either a

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,250
self-perpetuating board or a very

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:36,380
limited set of folks who can choose a

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:40,070
board or a mixture and the fact that we

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:43,550
are accountable to anybody who bothers

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:45,620
to sign up and vote every year means

00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,410
that there's more transparency more

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:51,410
opportunity to shape the organization to

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:54,170
meet the needs and it's I would say more

00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,850
trustworthy we certainly like to think

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,830
so

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,840
so other ways to get involved all of our

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,420
board meetings are held in an open IRC

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,920
channel and the times and agendas for

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,590
those are announced in advance on our

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,990
website anyone who would like is welcome

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,700
to show up on the channel and watch live

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,370
as we go through the board meetings I

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,320
will admit freely that we have worked

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,600
very hard to make board meetings as

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,840
boring as possible and what I mean by

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,690
that is we try not to have hugely

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,640
substantive debates or discussions

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,860
during the board meetings because they

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,170
take a lot of time and when we're asking

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,750
people to sort of drop everything else

00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,100
they're doing and focus on a meeting

00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,260
that's happening online

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,000
at a particular time of day for people

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,650
that are you know coming in from various

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,420
parts of the world it's just not

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,400
appropriate to have those run on for a

00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,830
really long time so I try to do the

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,350
debating on the mailing list or on IRC

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,450
in between meetings or whatever so that

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,370
by the time things come to the point

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,260
where someone's written the resolution

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,090
for us to vote on that it's pretty

00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,830
straight forward and people pretty much

00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,810
understand by the time we get to the

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:03,050
meeting what's going on what's gonna

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:05,480
happen we try very hard to not engage in

00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,980
lots of business that wasn't listed on

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,990
the agenda ahead of time because that

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,700
just seems unfair to people who are

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,860
trying to use the agenda to decide

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,810
whether to show up for one of the

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,490
meetings or not having said that every

00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:19,370
once in a while something comes up where

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:22,910
it seems appropriate to do that we had

00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:27,220
an item in fact the the vote on whether

00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:29,900
to make the grant to the Conservancy

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,640
through a process error didn't actually

00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,030
get put on the agenda for this last

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,260
board meeting and yet it had been

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,060
sufficiently thoroughly discussed by the

00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,830
board that we decided to go ahead and

00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,380
vote on it anyway that may have had

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,270
something to do with why the vote was

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,580
less unanimous than sometimes I don't

00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,990
know there also a number of mailing

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,670
lists there's a mailing list for

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,470
contributing members only there's a

00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,810
general mailing list there's a Board of

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,480
Directors mailing list all of those can

00:20:53,810 --> 00:21:00,260
be found out on the SPI dashing org list

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,000
site we try to go more open we do try to

00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,740
use them or open lists whenever the

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,110
topic permits which is most of the time

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,120
thankfully yeah it's actually very rare

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,930
that any discussion of importance

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,160
happens on the board list that's mostly

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,200
discussion about who's gonna go talk to

00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,330
the lawyers about a question that's come

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,260
up where we need to maintain

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,540
attorney-client privilege or something

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,600
like that it's actually very rare for us

00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,190
to have a meaningful conversation on a

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,470
list that's more private than the

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,700
contributing members list I know it's

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,650
easy for me to say that and not

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,510
everybody finds it easy to believe the

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,520
surgeons like that but it is really true

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,860
you can see everything that we're doing

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,770
by watching the public mailing list

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,140
archives and watching the published raw

00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:44,780
logs and cleaned up minutes of each of

00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,240
our board meetings so with that that's

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,600
the end of the sort of semi formal part

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,809
of the

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,870
pation we would love to hear any

00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:56,240
questions that you have about past

00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,020
current or possible future SPI

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,669
activities it's about let's have at it

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,620
so for the questions you have one

00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:11,630
microphone in the back and one in my

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:17,240
hand come on now don't be shy we don't

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:21,350
bite unless your food okay I'll try and

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:23,000
start a discussion can we say that in

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,750
the elections that basically seems like

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,190
anyone who's from Debian gets elected

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,909
which seems to and we seem to have quite

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,470
a pool of Debian people which you stand

00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:34,610
this is kind of good for spi in some

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:40,100
respect I'm not saying that gets into

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:41,960
bad outcome but in a way it's well in a

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,909
way part of the idea of having spi as a

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,650
general organization rather than some

00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:48,830
Debian foundation or whatever would seem

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:50,780
to be to try to remove from Debian

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,909
people responsibility for always having

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,409
to do this work it seems a bit like

00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:57,590
we're just doing it now for other

00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:59,480
organizations too I mean it's you

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,429
compared to the proportion of funds is a

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,380
lot higher proportion of Debian people

00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:04,789
on the board yes that's on the other

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,940
hand I will point out that we do have a

00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:09,470
couple of explicitly sort of non Debian

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,870
people on the board now and that's a

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,549
change from the past and so I'd like to

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,159
think that that sort of a transition

00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:18,559
that's in process I will admit that it

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,450
was I mean it was really good to see the

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,400
vote of confidence in the current board

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,289
represented by the folks who were

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,610
running for re-election being reelected

00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,429
at the same time I was very

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:31,010
disappointing to see the candidate who

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:33,830
was running this time who was not from

00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,909
the Debian context not get elected it

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,250
would have been great to have had

00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:40,190
another non Debian person on the board

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,659
but I don't say that too slight anybody

00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,570
that got reelected because they've all

00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:45,980
been good people first I personally push

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,150
my voting that way just because I

00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,150
thought it would be good to have another

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:58,059
concern and I mean I agree with

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:59,950
everything both of you said I think it's

00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:02,110
mainly

00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,950
tough issue getting anybody who's not

00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:07,450
already paying attention to SBI to be

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,310
aware that there's an election be aware

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,950
that they're eligible to vote follow the

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:15,160
steps to apply for membership and

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,810
request contributing status and they

00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,020
only have to do that part once and then

00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:21,520
they can vote every year it's it's a

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,920
tough problem it's mainly a matter of

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,990
Education I hope I mean part of the

00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,360
reason that we hold things like this Bob

00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,660
session is to try and spread the word

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,640
that a SPI exists it's doing things for

00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,400
Debian which not everybody knows and

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,130
then secondly to try and fan the flames

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,650
of interest a little bit I think when

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,300
things are going reasonably well there's

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,610
a strong tendency to go ah you know

00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:49,210
great just carry on and I don't want to

00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:52,810
be bothered but when things aren't

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,460
running great if you let it sort of go

00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,380
without paying attention for too long

00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,020
it's it's hard to know how to

00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,670
effectively make things change so so one

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,880
last briefing before we go to Zach's

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:05,710
question or whoever else

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,180
most of these buffs happen at DEFCON

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,670
simply because that's the main

00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,850
conference most of us go to I did hold

00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:14,950
one recently in December at least a 2012

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:17,470
which is the youth system administration

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,720
conference and I think it would be great

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:23,560
if either SPI board members or members

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,480
who are not on the board if anybody is

00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:29,440
interested in at other conferences where

00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:32,620
SPI project members might show up if you

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,540
want to hold a SPI Boff there talk with

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,180
us we can probably share the slides and

00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:40,690
adapt them as as necessary I can share

00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:43,330
what I did with Lisa etc so getting the

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,460
word out is a great idea I know there

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,470
was at least discussion about above it

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,030
one of the PostgreSQL fans I don't know

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,410
if it happened or not but that's the

00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,900
kind of solution that would help raise

00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,520
awareness yes right so yes I was just

00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,200
going to comment on that as well so it

00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,940
seems to me that in Debian we have been

00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,130
having both like this one since like

00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:04,420
ever at least as far as my memory goes

00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:06,640
so people in Debian is aware of what SPI

00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,440
does for that Ian right I it's probably

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,760
the case that other affiliated project

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,460
are not making the same kind of

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,430
advertisement within there

00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,560
about the existence bi so you have we

00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:20,180
have essentially a over representation

00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:23,610
of Debian contributing members with this

00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:26,130
I think it's also true that if you look

00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:29,400
at the list of associated projects there

00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,830
are a few if any that have as large an

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,740
active population of contributors as

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:36,330
Debian again I don't mean to slight any

00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,440
other projects but if I look down the

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,740
list there are a number of them that

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,530
represent six or eight or ten people and

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,150
the probability that in a project of

00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,340
that size there's someone who would

00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:49,620
think this was more important to do than

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,690
other things they might be working on

00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,970
may just be lower there are a couple

00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,790
like Postgres and maybe a few others you

00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,830
know drizzle and Jenkins but yet they

00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,630
represent really large user communities

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,340
well develop you know even in the

00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,250
drizzle community the number of active

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,800
developers is modest by Debian standards

00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,600
and that's great I mean it's a software

00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,290
project as opposed to Debian which is

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,800
you know a freakishly hard entity doing

00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:20,640
lots of stuff with lots of software so I

00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:22,080
again the the fact that we mentioned

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,180
this even before being asked a question

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,740
should indicate that it's something

00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,900
we're thinking about and are concerned

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,360
about would like to do an even better

00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,280
job from a diversification standpoint in

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,870
the future but I don't think there any

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,510
magic beans here I think this is

00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,950
something where you know we just have to

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,290
keep trying to get the word out and

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:43,410
making it clear that we'd love to have

00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:45,930
other participation it's also not even

00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,880
something that so it's yeah just a

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:51,480
related point it's something that would

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:55,350
be you know we all want this goal to get

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,750
the rest of SPI more involved in SPI at

00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,630
the same time it's not like we're paying

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:03,360
a huge manpower or effort price to have

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:06,840
these other projects even if they don't

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,150
get as involved the work is mostly the

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,270
same and if we were to do something

00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:14,810
separate for Debian or from from SPI the

00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:17,970
work would still be the same it's it's

00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:20,280
the the work scales better than human

00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:24,110
attentions cuz we should try to fix the

00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,110
mismatch but yeah

00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:40,320
when you are developing or have this

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:43,480
idea of developing letting develop

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,410
financial software you think that

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,620
someone outside could use improv I mean

00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:52,240
it's free software it will be available

00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,700
but I'm thinking of say independent

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,950
consultants mm-hmm could this software

00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,770
be useful to those types of people or

00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:03,490
our nonprofit organization that

00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:06,550
different they are so the answer is yes

00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:08,590
and no and the yes part is related to

00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:11,830
the fact that I don't believe that there

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:14,560
will be any instance here of starting a

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:17,440
new software project completely from

00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,510
scratch the if you actually go and read

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,620
the proposal that Bradley and the other

00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,870
folks at the software freedom

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,090
Conservancy put together their first

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,890
phase was to evaluate all the currently

00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:29,980
available free software for doing

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,600
accounting stuff to pick the sort of

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:35,080
closest best-in-class

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,900
solution and then in the second phase to

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,030
work on enhancing that to incorporate

00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,390
the functionality that's needed that's

00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,890
not already present so the yes part is I

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,040
think they're going to be adding

00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:50,890
attention extra developer hours and

00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:53,560
functionality to an existing you know

00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:56,140
free software solution and that can only

00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,060
help that particular free software

00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:02,080
solution be more applicable to more

00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:03,910
people the no part is that yeah there

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,700
really are a few things that we have to

00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:09,700
do on back to manage the finance

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,980
financial transaction processing for a

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,530
large set of associated projects that

00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:17,650
are really I think quite different from

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:20,800
the way this gets handled in other kinds

00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:24,370
of organizations I personally have have

00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:26,790
you know through my through my career at

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,960
HP I had the opportunity to watch

00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:31,120
thankfully from the outside how a

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,220
finance organization managed you know

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,470
gazillions of dollars for a really

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,389
really large corporation and there were

00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,159
some things that were sort of similar

00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:40,629
in that you know there were lots of

00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:42,309
different departments there were

00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:44,969
differences of subdivisions of the

00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:47,950
company as they merged and acquired and

00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:50,409
divested various businesses there were

00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:53,039
all sorts of complexities but none of

00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:55,299
the things they did had exactly the same

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,629
workflow or exactly the same

00:30:55,299 --> 00:31:00,459
transparency requirements that we have

00:30:57,629 --> 00:31:03,489
we would really in the limit like to be

00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:05,979
able to ensure that whoever is the sort

00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:08,379
of fiscally responsible representative

00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:10,869
for each of the projects could just go

00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:14,019
look at their transactions and data

00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:15,969
directly securely online without seeing

00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:18,249
all the data for all the other projects

00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:22,389
other than you know the kind of summary

00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:23,829
things we show we'd like for some kinds

00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:25,239
of transactions to be a little more

00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:28,289
automated than they have been in the

00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:30,389
past the processes that we go through

00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:34,179
we're really fortunate to have

00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:36,519
volunteers within SPI Josh burkas comes

00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:38,859
to mind as recently volunteering to

00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,869
handle a bunch of the paperwork

00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:43,539
associated with managing the google

00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:46,959
Summer of Code cash flow in and out of

00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:48,549
our Associated projects you know I would

00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:50,409
love to think that over time we'll be

00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:54,849
able to transition some of those either

00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:56,559
to better oiled processes using some of

00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:59,109
the new software we hope comes out of

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,450
this activity or perhaps as it's been

00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:03,249
proposed a couple of times recently by

00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,200
taking an advantage of existing services

00:32:03,249 --> 00:32:08,289
that are out there you know cloud

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,929
oriented web service providing companies

00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:12,549
that can do certain kinds of

00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:15,039
reimbursement or you know other

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:16,869
transaction processing for us that of

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,629
course always leads us down you know a

00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:21,999
discussion about are they using free

00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:24,729
software or not is it okay to use a

00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:26,619
commercial service that's not using free

00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:28,570
and those are all discussions that we'll

00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:32,829
continue to have every time anything

00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:35,499
ever gets proposed but in all honesty in

00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:37,359
some of these things what's important to

00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:40,479
me is that we're providing the best

00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,759
service we can to the organizations that

00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:45,249
we're trying to support and to every

00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,499
extent possible doing that in a way

00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:48,910
that's compatible with our mission and

00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:52,059
vision and object

00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:54,160
but I also don't want to be if there's a

00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:56,350
way that we could save a lot of human

00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,720
effort and do a better job for our

00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,370
progress it happens to involve you know

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,280
using a cloud service provider or

00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:06,429
something you know we'll investigate

00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:09,750
that and make the right decision so only

00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:15,280
two things to add to that great answer

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:17,860
one of them is that the main we use case

00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,309
outside of like SPI and the Conservancy

00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,960
for these particular additions as he's

00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:25,419
right it'll make the software better for

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,000
everybody in the community but the main

00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:30,370
use case for these new accounting

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,080
additions for nonprofits those are other

00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:35,049
nonprofits outside of the free software

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,340
world like charities and other physical

00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:40,480
sponsors that have different programs or

00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,490
similar things to keep track of if

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,190
there's there's there's nonprofits that

00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:51,070
sponsor artists for example etc and

00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:52,690
hopefully some of these projects will

00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,450
not want to be paying the huge ransom

00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,900
feast of the really expensive solutions

00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:00,610
or will not have been able to do that

00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,309
and won't have a good solution yet and

00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:06,190
once this actually gains traction if it

00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:08,200
does hopefully then we we and the

00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:11,830
Conservancy and the individual donors

00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:14,500
won't have to keep providing 100% of

00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,899
funding hopefully the funding base can

00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,310
become more diverse and the user base

00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:21,639
can become more diverse which is great

00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:24,250
for everyone and the only unrelated

00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,290
point is he mentioned Josh burkas as

00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,210
helping out it's worth noting that josh

00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:30,960
is not on the board he used to be but

00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:33,280
he's not on the board and he's a

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,169
treasurer he's an assistant treasurer he

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,179
was a treasurer but right now he has no

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:39,040
official status beyond helping out

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,869
Michael tributing member right

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,780
he has official status as a competing

00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:46,060
member so do many of you if you want it

00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,679
so my point with mentioning that is that

00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,379
you don't have to be on the board to

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,530
contribute if you were to run for

00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:55,240
election like regars did and didn't get

00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:57,700
elected there's still lots of ways to

00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,920
help out or if you want to be more

00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,370
selective about which tasks you handle

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,900
it's at

00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:06,900
yeah exactly right other questions

00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:23,960
Lucas um question so I was thinking

00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:25,190
about the SPF at 5% you take on

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,279
donations yes

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:31,210
fortunately reserves are you planning to

00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:35,470
increase that because of the bookkeeping

00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:39,259
no please I plan to decrease that

00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:41,749
possibly decrease we've not actually had

00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:43,249
a recent discussion about that so that

00:35:41,749 --> 00:35:45,890
everyone understands what we're talking

00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:48,019
about the sort of standard deal that SBI

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:50,630
has for associated projects is that we

00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:52,640
take 5% of the donations that come into

00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,490
each project and put those in the SPI

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,009
general reserves to use for covering our

00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:00,589
expenses of operation that's actually

00:35:58,009 --> 00:36:02,930
within the context of organizations like

00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:05,720
us it's one of the lowest if not the

00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:07,759
lowest fees I'm aware of and as I

00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,789
mentioned earlier we haven't been

00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:12,440
spending a lot of that money and so that

00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:13,970
number has been growing there are

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,460
different schools of thought about this

00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,829
there's a belief that you know any

00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,349
organization like SPI needs to maintain

00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:24,230
a general reserve large enough to handle

00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:25,970
you know one to two years worth of

00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:28,039
activity should all of a sudden

00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,619
something happened economically that

00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:34,579
causes the income stream to dry up on

00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:37,220
the other hand the kinds of things that

00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:39,440
you could think of as possible sort of

00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:42,049
horrible situations that we might need a

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,539
lot of money to go deal with would all

00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:46,549
require so much more money than what we

00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:49,999
have in our general reserves that we

00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:51,529
really have mostly focused on sort of

00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,660
thinking about the contingencies

00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:55,579
associated with the commitments to

00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,349
things like bookkeeping in other words

00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:59,150
I'm more worried about making sure we

00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:00,650
have you know six to eight K a year to

00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,690
pay for bookkeeping than I am about

00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:05,299
having enough money to mount a legal

00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:08,569
defense fund or something like that so

00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:11,299
having said all of that this is the

00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:12,950
first time we've ever made a grant out

00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:15,109
of the general fund that I'm aware of

00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:18,890
and I've been involved in SPI for a

00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:20,390
pretty long time I think that there's

00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,970
there's going to be a question in the

00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:25,039
future about whether being in a position

00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:28,180
to do something like this once in a

00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:30,490
while is a good idea or whether

00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:33,579
this particular grant was for something

00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:36,369
that's so specifically demonstrably

00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:37,420
useful to SPI itself that it was a good

00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:40,000
thing to do and that we should not

00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:43,359
really generally be in the in the

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,859
business of making grants to people but

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,369
I think we've certainly demonstrated

00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:51,970
that we're growing the general reserves

00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:54,099
faster than we need to and so I would

00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,619
definitely not expect that percentage to

00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:58,240
go up and if anything I'd like to see it

00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:01,089
go down a little bit just because I'd

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,940
like to be more efficient on behalf of

00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:05,740
our associated projects but all the

00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,960
projects we've talked to so far when

00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,069
they've been trying to decide whether to

00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,130
associate with SPI

00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:14,619
I've never had anybody tell me that 5%

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,750
was too much in fact everybody's always

00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:18,010
said that's a pretty good deal compared

00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:22,030
to the other options that we have

00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:24,760
available to us so you know if you ever

00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,410
feel any pressure in your role as DPL or

00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,240
if anybody else and I'm one of our

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,720
associated projects has a concern about

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:35,170
that we'd be happy to have input but

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,119
right now I would say no change in the

00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,980
near-term and if it changed at all in

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,890
the longer term it would probably be to

00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,569
go down but we'll just have to see if we

00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,549
dream up other good things we ought to

00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:56,530
do that cost money our thinking might

00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:58,270
change there's another question with the

00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,309
bookkeeping company also used the

00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,770
accounting software and with the fees

00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:05,290
for them well that's a really good

00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,540
question I don't expect that their fees

00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,670
would go down if they switch - the

00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,589
question was is the bookkeeping company

00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,359
likely to switch over to use the

00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:16,599
software that we're gonna pay to develop

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,880
that software is is really more for our

00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,589
internal use than something with it's

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,150
important for our bookkeeper to be using

00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:25,450
though it would be nice if our

00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:28,420
bookkeeper using the same software I

00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:30,609
don't know whether we can get them to

00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,349
switch over this is all a little bit

00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:34,569
speculative because of course what we

00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:37,480
have right now is a project that we're

00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:39,849
trying to help fund that will hopefully

00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,950
deliver a useful result sometime in the

00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:43,200
future

00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:45,900
so until we actually see the results of

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,030
that it's hard to even have that

00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,200
conversation with the bookkeeper I will

00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,180
tell you that the bookkeeper we have

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,570
chosen is currently not using free

00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:56,520
software and that's annoying but it

00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:58,829
count falls in the category of we need a

00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,380
service they have the ability to provide

00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:03,810
a service and so we've selected them to

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,609
provide that service to us we certainly

00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:08,880
intend to have that conversation with

00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:11,220
them when we get through this assuming

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,220
the conservancies project becomes fully

00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:16,320
funded and by the way the grant we made

00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,410
is not enough to help them reach their

00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,970
final funding objective and but but

00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,339
they're getting close they've received

00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,990
quite a few contributions from various

00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:28,530
other places in the last time I looked

00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:30,240
they were now there something like 80 or

00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:32,609
85 percent of their funding I think

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,609
they're you know we their funding

00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:39,660
objective total was 70 or 75 thousand

00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:41,730
and you know we got them from maybe the

00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,290
fifty thousand something to the sixty

00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,619
thousand something so it helped a lot

00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:48,420
they can use more help right so anyway

00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:50,550
we hope that that project becomes fully

00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,200
funded obviously if it doesn't become

00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,030
fully funded and they decide not to

00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,369
proceed then the money we've just

00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,530
granted them comes back to SPI that's

00:40:56,369 --> 00:41:00,240
not a problem in fact I suspect we won't

00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:02,160
actually give them the money until they

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,050
find out if they're fully funded but I

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,440
haven't personally worried about the

00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:09,630
logistics on that too much but to sort

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,839
of bottom-line your question I don't

00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:15,750
expect that talking a bookkeeper into

00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:19,579
changing their software tools would

00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:22,079
actually cause them to charge us less

00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:23,910
because we would be driving them to have

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,819
to learn something new to do something

00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,770
different than what they do normally for

00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,869
all of their other clients so unless

00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,609
they got so excited that they said oh

00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:34,980
yes this would make our lives so much

00:41:32,609 --> 00:41:37,650
simpler for everybody we do work for I

00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,660
would expect if anything forcing them to

00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:42,119
use a tool that we selected would cost

00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,130
us more and not less even if it's free

00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,560
software if they do use a lot of

00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:49,020
nonprofits as apply if they do have a

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,910
lot of nonprofit clients and if a lot of

00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:53,290
nonprofits gain traction with this and

00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:58,150
it becomes the

00:41:53,290 --> 00:42:01,010
default small-to-medium nonprofit

00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:02,900
solution it's possible that it could

00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:06,350
become an easy sell eventually but

00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,580
that's an optimistic outcome and the

00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:10,760
thing doesn't exist yet

00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,260
so alright okay well I want to thank you

00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,520
all very much for your time and your

00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,260
attention and the questions this

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,150
afternoon I understand we're essentially

00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,950
completely out of time at this point so

00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,690
I'll thank you all for your attention

00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,040
and let you know that I'll be back to

00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,830
run another buff here in another hour

00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,730
and a half or so Thank You Jimmy

00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:35,820
Thank You B Dave thank you thank you

00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:35,820
