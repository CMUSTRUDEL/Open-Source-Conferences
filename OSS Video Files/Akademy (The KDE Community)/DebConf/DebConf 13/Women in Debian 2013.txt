	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,920
so we are going to hear a presentation

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,440
about the state of women in Debian

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,870
currently it's going to be presented by

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,679
medium-risk who has been part of the

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,719
Debian women project since 2005

00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:19,289
patty Langer sake who has been attending

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:23,939
that home since 2004 has finally decided

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:35,910
to shine the new Debian developer

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:39,540
process this year hello my name is Pat

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:45,559
Elin Gajic I have been somewhat involved

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:50,370
in Debian for nine years now since four

00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:51,809
well I'm pleased I came in 2004 first

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,899
time when I came through the young women

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,300
so I know that it's important for this

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:03,840
project and they work to do that more

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:06,119
women to into Debian so Debbie and woman

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
actually originally started in 2004 and

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,400
what we want to cover today is the

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,590
journey from 2004 until today so how has

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,869
the Debian project improved Debian and

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,259
how has the Debian women project

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,020
actually accomplished its goals in the

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:26,810
beginning you can see we do have a

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,939
couple of images of the w and women

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:33,990
people congregating at Deborah different

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:38,220
columns at Deb comp for was the

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,020
beginning of Debian women Erin Clark and

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,380
Amaya

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:47,280
Amaya Rodrigo gave a presentation in

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,439
Porto Alegre discussing the the concerns

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,939
that women have in getting involved in

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,680
Debian and the amazing thing was there

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,979
was such a huge turnout that they

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,590
overfilled the main talk room trying to

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,009
just get across why we need to get women

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,420
involved in Debian and how we can do it

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:10,140
what it did for us was it opened that

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,670
dialogue so that we could start having

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,800
this open conversation with the

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,300
community at

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:21,180
about diversity in general not just

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:23,940
women and thus the birth of the Debian

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,180
women project we started with very

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,400
simple means we created an IRC channel

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,520
then on freenode it's the same channel

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,120
but now we're on oft see we had created

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,930
a mailing list too for people to

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,700
basically feel welcomed into Debian and

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,470
to feel less intimidated and getting

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,410
involved having people being able to

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,840
respond to them in a friendly welcoming

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,940
non-threatening manner and we also

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,370
created our website the Debian women

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,269
website which just gives our main main

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,820
goals and our missions but bearing in

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:03,810
mind that Debian exists to welcome

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,970
everyone and Debian women which is a sub

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,360
project within Debian it's it's not

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,790
separate from Debian at all we exist to

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,709
encourage and promote women to be more

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:20,519
active and participate fully and dubbing

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:22,530
our mission is threefold first we intend

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,650
to balance and diversify Debian for the

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,690
better of Debian we do this by actively

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,269
engaging with the interested women with

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,829
the women who want to be involved and by

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:36,090
encouraging participation and

00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:37,620
involvement in the Debian project second

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,140
we want to promote women's involvement

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,560
in Debian so we want the women who are

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,480
contributing to Debian to be actively

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,519
acknowledged we want everybody to know

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,250
that these are contra contributors and

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,230
what they're contributing to Debian we

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,450
provide mentoring and role models

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,910
Marga's and the excellent role model for

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,070
pretty much all women in Debian she has

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:03,870
she is instrumental in hoping everybody

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:06,660
for example we also want to create

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,489
opportunities for collaboration with new

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,690
and current members in the Debian

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:14,670
project and mostly we welcome the

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,829
involvement of everyone interested in

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:23,340
increasing the participation of women in

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:25,320
Debian not just women so this all

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,800
started in 2004 we developed our mission

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,930
statement

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,729
we started actually branching out and

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,129
reaching out to women to get them

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,590
involved to get a good starting point

00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:39,720
early in 2005

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:44,370
Magne ensign ensign Owen soon did a

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,280
master's thesis study to participate

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,289
alized the participation of women in the

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,710
mailing lists she also collected some

00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:55,770
data from other studies and what she

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:59,219
found was that across the the open

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:02,629
source community there's less than 2% of

00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:05,280
women actually actively involved and

00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:08,789
even worse than that in Debian there was

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,440
only 0.3 percent participation on the

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:15,569
mailing lists just FYI in the tech

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,639
industry at the time women participation

00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:19,590
in tech industry where they were getting

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,400
actually paid for their work in

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:26,370
contributions was 20% so we still fall

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:30,029
well below even what industry standards

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,560
are so the take home is that Debian has

00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:37,770
less than half of the participation

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:40,550
levels of other comparable projects just

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:43,580
a few numbers of what she actually

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:48,599
studied she looked at these three main

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,250
mailing lists in Debian DeBell there was

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,409
probably the worst participation of

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,969
women which isn't surprising because the

00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:56,129
percentage of women was really low and

00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:59,520
Debian votes we had a pretty low

00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:01,860
percentage in Debian women we were still

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:07,400
less than half percent participating on

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,400
the Debian women mailing list yes

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:14,870
so that was nine years ago

00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:19,129
surely we're doing better now right so

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:25,729
Laura Joan Arena actually recreated this

00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:29,430
this study and analyzed similar

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:31,169
parameters we do have I do want to give

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,690
full disclosure that the dates are not

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,479
similar but the percentages are still

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,710
pretty on still pretty spot on when we

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,750
look

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:45,920
other data in Debian developer is no

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,060
change in Debian votes there's some

00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,220
change we have a little bit more

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,950
participation with women but not not a

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,480
lot for a nine year increase and Debbie

00:06:51,950 --> 00:07:01,850
and women hey we're more than 50

00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:04,280
percents so some more statistics to kind

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:08,630
of put this into perspective about

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:13,480
what's going on in 2005 we had three

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:17,090
female Debian developers out of 965 in

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:19,910
2013 we now have 18 Debian developers

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,190
that is an increase and and we we don't

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:26,440
want to play down the fact that we now

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:29,840
have 15 more Debian developer women but

00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,560
if you look at the increase of men

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,230
Debian developers we're still not quite

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,760
we're not keeping up pace and we're not

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:44,450
really promoting ourselves as much as we

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:52,640
need to five women voted for DPL in this

00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:54,590
last election versus 385 men so the

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,570
participation level of the women is

00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:00,410
actually significantly lower than the

00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:04,250
participation of level of the men we

00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:06,650
have we've had one DPL candidate and in

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:12,340
2005 we had nine women in the new

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:12,340
maintainer queue in 2013 we have one

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:21,080
just to drive home the point we're not

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,670
really getting much more traction in

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,090
women being involved in Debian at this

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:28,000
point you'll notice the participation in

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:32,090
Deb Kampf

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,390
we have pretty much the same amount of

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:44,210
women coming to Deb Kampf from Deb Kampf

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:48,740
seven in Edinburgh to today and you'll

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:50,670
notice women are not actually joining

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,160
the new maintainer queue

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,320
they're uploading we're getting their

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,820
first uploads here but they're not going

00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,950
into the new maintainer queue and

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,760
they're not adding their key to the

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:06,120
keyring so that they're they're

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,300
interested but they're not actually

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,510
coming into the project yeah I wanted to

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,270
to include this this light to see how

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:19,230
other some other products in free

00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:22,650
software make managing and how these

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:25,380
numbers can really be increased and I'm

00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:28,950
I'm having these figures they are quite

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,020
all the iPhone from 2010 in Ubuntu and

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,030
in Mozilla which are two plates that

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:37,050
seems to attract women better than we

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:40,380
are and in Ubuntu in 2010 they were

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,360
already five percent of women developing

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,670
the involved in the developed somehow in

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,080
the development of the project taking

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,840
into account that involved in the

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,000
development is a very well it's a very

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,830
why the word it did means from

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,380
participating community to make

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,650
documentation translations and staff and

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,190
in Mozilla the they are already over 15%

00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:05,070
or 16% they were already there in 2010

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,690
and this cuprates there are other

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,840
products which I don't have the numbers

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,180
but they're also higher than than asked

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,740
with sample genome Pro project on and

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,830
stuff they're all there other tricks

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:20,220
doing worse than asked you but these

00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:24,450
numbers show that whenever some project

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,820
is well some things do work there's some

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,950
things that can be done that seems to to

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,580
achieve some results and to get more

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:35,550
women to into the development so the

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,860
point is what are the the questions

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,930
would be what's preventing us even

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,410
though even though we have been we have

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:45,750
evolved a lot since 2005 and and stuff

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:49,020
we'll had we're more a more welcoming

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:52,020
community we have improved a lot in a

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:57,030
lot of ways we're still not getting more

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:59,280
women and I would like to know to find

00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,749
out where the earth cycles are were why

00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,209
and

00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:05,879
joining what way there are not more

00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:10,079
women joining the development of Debian

00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:12,660
and we still we don't know where we're

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,509
losing the women I mean I women not use

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:19,800
in Debian I mean they're using they may

00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:22,499
be preferably a fedora Susie even are

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,679
they using Debian modeun feel attracted

00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:27,509
or we not been able to show them that

00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,660
they can join the development it sound

00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:33,209
how in some way do they try to to get

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,939
into the development and then they skirt

00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:38,100
and try and flee away the first contact

00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:41,129
we don't know what what were the

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,199
probably the problems lie what we know

00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:45,089
is that there's some certain barriers

00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:47,249
entry barriers that affect women

00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:50,189
different than men statistically this is

00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:52,709
also this takes and I would like to do

00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:55,019
with something from the women here how

00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:57,300
many women are already involved somehow

00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:03,209
someway has the main contribute and

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:10,579
Austrian contributors yeah how many

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:13,589
women are not the rest okay how many

00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:16,709
males how many people here know women

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:21,620
that the partners sisters of staff that

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:24,660
are not involved in Debian okay

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,360
okay right so what do you think why

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,040
don't the the women here that are not

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,529
involved in the development of Debian or

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,820
the people who know women who are not

00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:35,009
involved in the development of Debian

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,620
why do you think they are not team Bob

00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:47,069
what I mean it's still a fun question I

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:49,949
really would like to get some answers hi

00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:53,130
so actually my wife she's really asking

00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:55,350
well how can I get involved and and and

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,970
she's what she's sort of scared of

00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,310
getting off because she cannot hack she

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,889
cannot package he cannot code and it's

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:04,769
always like well yes get in contact with

00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:07,050
the people and so we arranged

00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:08,610
we couldn't arrange her getting here for

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,259
Deb comp this is a bit unfortunate at

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:16,949
that point but I think this contributing

00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:20,610
for a non coder for non packager for a

00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:23,550
non IT person is unclear it's not it's

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:27,360
not so evident what are the jobs are

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,970
there so yes so it's not science but

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,550
it's not so evident that there there are

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,709
a lot of things to do in Debian that are

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:41,040
not coding that not even technical

00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:42,569
yes it's it's it's about him I was asked

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,199
to stand up actually

00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:48,209
it's about shyness maybe in that case

00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:50,519
not generally but in that case it might

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:53,550
be but as she has she already tried to

00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,310
at least get in contact with something

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,649
and try to do I mean has she tried to

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,930
find out if there's something in which

00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:04,230
she would like to get involved or she's

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:07,470
just like I don't feel there's nothing

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,180
in it anything there for me yes she is

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,449
she's involved in the Debian a to work

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,519
she's involved in the we deploy Debian

00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:17,130
Eduard schools locally show she she's

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,470
involved in the local project and she

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,220
has Debian on a notebook because nothing

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,220
else is allowed at home

00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:30,259
yes and I think I think I don't think

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,670
well I don't know what it actually is we

00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:34,639
have to investigate at home probably yes

00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:37,129
but it's it's I here shyness I here well

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,949
what can I do and well I cannot

00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:42,199
contribute in a package maybe she finds

00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:45,589
I mean I know it's it's a common feeling

00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:47,860
Debian or getting in contact with Debian

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:53,209
at the beginning quite intimidating

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:56,269
sorry I mean does she feel you said

00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:58,449
she's she's kind of shine away is she

00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:02,449
finding them Ian maybe too intimidating

00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:04,249
too scary you mean you mean doing it all

00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:06,170
in public and stuff like that oh yeah

00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:08,180
like getting involved of more or less I

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,800
know everyone sees the world officially

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,470
because this do you know what her

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,569
impression of Debian women is do I know

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,059
what do you know what her impression of

00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:21,589
Debian women is what what she believes

00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:24,499
Debian woman is or um no actually I'm I

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:28,189
don't know I don't know so she's I know

00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:30,379
that she's reading the list and and at

00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:32,959
some points she's wondering why to

00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:35,779
differentiate between men and women so

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,490
what is the actual girl she's squaring

00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:47,569
that but you have to ask her not me

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:50,269
actually I just have some Michael I just

00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:52,490
want to say them seventeen years ago I

00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:56,209
came to Debian because a woman just

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:58,399
invited me so she it was Susan Kleinman

00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:01,339
and thanks to her for all the time she

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:05,269
compiled for Linux kernels all the

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:06,679
specific device I needed and that's why

00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:09,350
I sort of deviance tried to see abuse

00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:13,459
for me so the other thing I wanted to

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:17,209
say as far as I know in IT generally

00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:21,589
women's are I have not so big share like

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:23,269
men but in non-free software the share

00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:28,879
is very larger than a free software

00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:30,709
right and I was thinking about well free

00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,449
software is about freedom it's not

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:34,980
really about harmony we all swimming

00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:37,769
upstream all the time and

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,100
maybe the Harmony we would like to need

00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:44,250
in Davion is something people is not

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,959
really attracting because they really do

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,500
not really like to go upstream and fight

00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:51,449
for something right and maybe this might

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,510
be reason and if and see the numbers you

00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:56,459
showed between Debian and Ubuntu it is 2

00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,820
or 5 percent since the same maker all of

00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:03,600
magnitude but Mozilla is kind of 10

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,520
times it's because people vanilla is

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,350
used on Windows and is everywhere it is

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:13,589
not really upstream anymore it is amiss

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:16,230
mainstream and and it's made fit more

00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:19,589
visas feeling of harmony and not in

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:22,230
contrast to something else and it's just

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:24,780
a zero I don't know it but maybe is it

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,400
some idea I don't know how to solve this

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,370
problem yes do you mean that one of the

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,000
factors could be that yes the women are

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:35,160
more attracted to more mainstream less

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:42,750
geeky which is not not bad I will not

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:44,309
read it's so if you'll permit me I have

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,720
actually three comments which I will try

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,520
to get through quickly first of all I

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,290
think the way that you phrase that

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,510
question is actually a little bit unfair

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,490
because you asked do you know women who

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,750
are not involved in Debian and why not

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,970
well I think everybody in this room

00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,590
probably knows both men and women who

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,150
are not involved in Debian absolutely

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,250
and are we putting too much expectation

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,280
on the women in our lives regarding this

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,380
point also I will avoid the obvious

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,760
discussion of certain parties that I

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,559
could speak about who are not involved

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,730
in Debian development currently I will

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:19,350
leave that to them since they're on

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:21,570
stage the second point is and this goes

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,130
to what Mike had to say about asking the

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,730
question about why the focus on men

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,740
versus women

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:30,600
I found interestingly there seems to be

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:33,900
a very there's a cultural so like German

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:38,700
cultures Austria Germany their approach

00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,980
to equality you know gender equality is

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,020
it seems to be a solved issue for them

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,390
and so they perceive any kind of

00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,280
affirmative action kind of ideas like

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,800
Debbie and women they tend to view a

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,180
very negative

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,000
my experience in talking with people

00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,860
from those cultures and so there is

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,440
there's kind of a if you're trying to

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,420
actually get more women involved in

00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,770
Debian you need to be sensitive to

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,480
cultural differences in that regard

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,160
because like in the United States we

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,560
view affirmative action as something we

00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,910
view this is an ongoing problem but in

00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Germany they look at that and say well

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,970
if you have to have this system you're

00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,940
doing it wrong in the first place and

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,200
they may be right I don't I don't know

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,640
but it is it's it's like there's

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,380
different perspectives on gender

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,240
equality in that regard which does play

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,530
into this and I guess the third thing I

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,270
and I would actually turn this back over

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,770
to you now is I would I would like to

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,710
ask you if you are familiar with the

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:29,050
concept of an imposter syndrome and you

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,350
can speak about about that and what role

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:36,340
you think that plays I think it's a very

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:39,160
real syndrome I I mean whenever you move

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,620
into that Matt might not be white thread

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,860
knowledge but whenever you move into

00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:47,530
especially women only lists like no

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,170
Linux chicks the sisters and stuff you

00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:53,410
you you get to know that the syndrome is

00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,880
quite a spread I'm sorry I realize we're

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,260
having this conversation and many of the

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,880
people in the audience may not realize

00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,410
why I'm referring to when I say imposter

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,080
syndrome so should I should I explain

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,710
that or would you like to it's okay okay

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,160
so imposter syndrome is this idea that

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:13,270
women as Outsiders to the community will

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:16,870
often feel that they are not good enough

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:19,720
and that they are there some way less

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:22,870
qualified than their male peers in the

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,900
field despite having equal or superior

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,700
skills they will they will have the

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,070
internal their their their their own

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:35,140
impression of their own skills is that

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:37,060
they are not as good and as a result as

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,390
a result they will have a tendency to

00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,070
you know not step up in the same way

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,260
that a man might in the same situation

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,690
and this is not specific to men versus

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,980
women is this the idea of imposter

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,680
syndrome shows up in other other

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,020
scenarios but the but but eventually

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,460
some that some event happens and they

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,870
have this light bulb that goes on and

00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,310
this has been the case for lots of women

00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,600
in technology and a lot of women have

00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,440
talked about this over the past few

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,060
years that oh I act

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,950
and good enough I've been doing this all

00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,630
the time I'm just as good as them and I

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,040
just thought I wasn't good enough so

00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,420
that's that's the idea of impostor

00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,660
syndrome and I don't know what the right

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,400
strategies are for dealing with that but

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,860
that's it I think it's you're totally

00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,850
right and I think it's more my personal

00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,540
feeling is that it's more widespread

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:24,220
than than most people think and I mean

00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:27,740
most of the women around me me included

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,170
have sometimes or somehow or even most

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,730
of the time that impostor syndrome so

00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:36,920
yeah I mean it's so that's that's a fact

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:40,460
and how to cope with it I don't know I

00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,910
mean it's it's not it's hard to to do

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,460
because I in my opinion because it's so

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:50,000
I mean so so bigger than Debian I mean

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:52,310
it's so involved in norms in our

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,490
cultural and social environment from

00:21:52,310 --> 00:22:00,110
scratch that okay I actually do you have

00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,270
an idea how you can tackle this problem

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:06,440
that's basically the same idea I brought

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:09,590
up in an ambien buff give people clearer

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,570
guidelines tell them okay if you have a

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,960
subset of these and these and these

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:18,620
skills then we can talk about you being

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,230
qualified enough just give them data how

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,760
to be what what does qualified mean

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,850
because as a woman if you walk around

00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,440
this conference you will meet yeah

00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:30,560
roughly basically two types of people

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,630
the one type I'm not sure which one is

00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,540
worse there's one type who will overly

00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:38,090
encourage you you you will tell you yeah

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,130
yeah you did some work and you feel no

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,960
it is not enough and if you look at the

00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,900
data what you should have been doing it

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,970
is really not enough so over encouraging

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,160
is not helping and you have these people

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,020
who are really picky which is not

00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,540
helping either but maybe some people

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,090
with reasonable ideas what you should

00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,500
what skills you should have and what you

00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,630
should have done how involved you should

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,510
be in the community should get together

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,700
and gather some data and make a list for

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,740
people who are not really sure if

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,020
they're good enough to look at and just

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,180
say okay this I can do this at I can do

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,540
this I cannot do maybe this would be

00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,540
helpful

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:26,110
okay do you guys want to respond to that

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:27,880
or should I just okay hi so I'm really

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:31,270
glad you guys are running this session

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,059
I guess I'd to remarks so far first is

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:36,429
when you show all these women who are in

00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:39,160
the who are who are doing their first

00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:41,410
uploads that's great is somebody making

00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,500
sure that they get around to applying to

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,240
nm and if not if you do that then you

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,100
will give those women a social advantage

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,360
over their men peers which is would it

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:55,090
be perfect so you should do that and

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,770
secondly in a way this do this is a

00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,900
topic that I hope that is useful

00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,460
contextual information so when I think

00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,260
about diversity issues I try to think

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,700
about not just gender diversity but

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,220
other kinds of diversity and too along

00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,710
those lines I think about Indian people

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,240
in the IT sector and I consider if you

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,799
look around this room maybe all the

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,270
people who are of Indian or South Asian

00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:18,070
descent can you raise your hands right

00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:19,780
so you can actually do the same graphs

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,480
that you did at the beginning for

00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,510
non-white people in Debian they

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,640
represent n percent of the proprietary

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,950
and even maybe generally software a

00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,370
contribution world but only and divided

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:35,169
by 12 or whatever in Debian and to me

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,330
that suggests that the problems in

00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:38,770
Debian are broader than gender diversity

00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,780
problems and that's sort of why years

00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,549
ago I gave a talk called Debian for shy

00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,059
people which is kind of like trying to

00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:54,640
unify these issues so just one thought

00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:57,039
yeah I think okay well I think this

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,890
imposter syndrome Steve had said is true

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,500
also for men so there is no no I think

00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,840
we all suffering from it and just some

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,370
people are more able to ignore it and

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,630
some not so much

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:12,700
and the only thing I think we should

00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:15,610
invite just everybody as you say it

00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,890
enough and I think in my team they are

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,679
also showing up from time to time some

00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:23,120
women and I really really hope that and

00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:27,230
we are inviting them and I'm really

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,330
about this but you can't drag somebody

00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:32,600
in free software he needs to come

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,700
voluntarily and I just think we should

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,730
keep on the good work to invite

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,590
newcomers women or men and really really

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,530
hope that there are more women amongst

00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,400
it we we have also developed tools I

00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:48,320
will report today what mentoring and so

00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,050
and I hope we can invite more movement

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,320
but I don't see what what I could do

00:25:51,050 --> 00:26:08,570
differently to do before we go what did

00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:09,470
to talk to him okay and I agree with

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,440
what she said

00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:15,880
totally and I think on that respect we

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:19,130
have two issues one is a problem about

00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,090
self-assessment without we don't give

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:26,330
easy ways for people to self assess and

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:28,010
figure out if they you know become self

00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,900
confident with their work in that being

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,490
one tends to feel like oh my god I don't

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,470
know enough there's people discussing

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,090
things I do not understand there's

00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,440
always people discussing things you do

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,470
not understand in Debian so that's

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,600
perfectly okay and the other thing it's

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,580
about another blown perception of the

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,179
project's expectations which is somewhat

00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,770
related but not quite since every time

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:50,990
you actually do something for them in

00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,520
you get criticism from some one or the

00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,450
other it looks like the project has very

00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,150
high expectations

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,309
whereas what you need to learn is to not

00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,960
care about criticism because it's the

00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:02,900
bacterin system problem you make a

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,400
software bug reports and that many

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,150
people are used to the us in our

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,830
environment and the instinct is to try

00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,200
and find ways to improve it and it's a

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,330
positive instinct but we tend to forget

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,850
to find ways to thank you and to say

00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:21,080
well that actually is useful it made my

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:24,080
life better and we are not that used to

00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,330
that and that drives very much ha up the

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,330
perceived expectation of Debian which is

00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:32,450
a problem because it's hard to get

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:33,679
involved when you feel that people that

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,009
you can never fulfill people's

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,830
expectations

00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:41,279
and that curbs creativity it's not just

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:45,539
an inclusion problem it's a I think we

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,210
lose contributions based on that as well

00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:50,429
after he said that and I would like to

00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,710
ask if we are in a general question time

00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:55,409
or if we should let you go on with the

00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,090
talk because I may have other things to

00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:59,940
say but I was keeping them from have a

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:03,119
couple of flights more but I mean I

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:05,690
would find this interesting enough to

00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:09,409
keep it running

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:14,690
okay so I've heard a few different

00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:17,070
comments here that all have one or

00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:20,549
there's an idea I have that could

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:24,359
possibly slightly help a bunch of these

00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:28,950
different things I some people pointed

00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:32,489
out that women another other less

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:34,619
represented groups might feel shy or

00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:36,149
have an impostor syndrome or not realize

00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:38,489
the ways to contribute other than

00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:42,690
packaging or not realize even what that

00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:43,200
being does so we may want to have on our

00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:49,139
homepage

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:51,330
a rotating people in debian or this you

00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:54,090
know rotating your spotlight on people

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,970
in debian and make sure that it includes

00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,169
you know clear I mean sure it could

00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,509
include some men and some packaging

00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,879
maintainers but it should include you

00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:06,179
know clear evidence of the breath of

00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:09,720
people and tasks in debian including

00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:11,850
ones you know that would be welcoming to

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,850
people from the backgrounds we're

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:17,580
discussing and you know maybe their

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,889
picture name if they're willing or first

00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:23,450
name or whatever they're okay with a

00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:30,269
summary of what they do and a link to

00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:32,009
say join him or join her and that would

00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:36,149
go to the new how you can get how you

00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:38,249
can start to help page thought to help

00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,820
encourage them to volunteer and be

00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:40,820
welcoming

00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:49,790
these two questions and we'll go to the

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:53,870
next slide because otherwise no no there

00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:58,190
were two people what say something yeah

00:29:53,870 --> 00:30:02,960
I can tell you a short story about Def

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:06,710
Con 2011 I wanted I thought this is the

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,210
best place to get more involved or less

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:12,410
something more in fact packaging so I

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:15,080
was asking around why did you make maybe

00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,750
a workshop packaging for beginners so I

00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,970
was told for many people he is a

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,820
conference for developer you are the

00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:25,340
only one doesn't know it so it will be

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,310
not interesting fun for nobody but I was

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,860
insisting on mailing lists and on Vicky

00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:33,170
and then first signed up maybe three or

00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,970
five people and then after say okay

00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,760
maybe some people just know how to use

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:40,010
Vicky so I and it is more for many lists

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,840
and talking to people and then on the

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:49,460
end thank you for jelly the one workshop

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:52,340
was was took place and then on Vicky was

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:56,860
maybe 12 people signed up and in the

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,860
talk shown up more than 50 people

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:07,440
and many people especially local people

00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,780
from Bosnia Serbia they were very

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,100
thankful and they wanted to be that

00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:16,170
would be it would be video it because

00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,560
they wanted to only get involved and

00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:22,170
learn about it so my conclusion is but

00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,640
now I see I see there's something change

00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:27,930
because now you have the workshops

00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,550
without my suggestion again here is it's

00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,010
very good and you are talking about this

00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:34,880
I think also is very good so a my

00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:37,860
suggestion you have you should make more

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,680
tutorial my own mentoring and be more

00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,630
open and welcoming of course there's

00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,250
everything documented everything said

00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:47,550
yet everything documented but I think

00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:49,530
not everyone is able spend a one-week of

00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:52,140
time and the radio documentation is

00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,270
easier to be taken by friend and saying

00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,750
oh maybe you can start this and then you

00:31:54,270 --> 00:32:01,230
wait one documentation then it will go

00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:03,240
to the next step I think yeah if you go

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,030
this way you will have more women and

00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,180
more new newbies I think you have been

00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:13,740
welcoming for all new people I met also

00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:19,289
a lot of shy males so thank you

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:22,749
[Applause]

00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:24,879
okay so if you'll forgive me this will

00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:26,470
take a little bit of time to set up so

00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:27,519
I've commented previously about how

00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,249
there are cultural differences between

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,529
some countries where you know gender

00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:35,440
equality is considered a solved problem

00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:36,820
in other countries where it's not so

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,409
having said that I'm now going to

00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,809
explain why the Germans are actually

00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:43,899
wrong about this they may be right for

00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:45,999
Germany and Austria but they are wrong

00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:48,399
with respect to other cultures and the

00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:51,039
reason they're wrong is that there is a

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,210
difference if the people in the group in

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,419
question perceive there to be a

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:57,610
difference so how women feel about

00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:59,409
things and whether they feel that

00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,809
they're outside versus inside if they

00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:04,419
feel that debian is dominated by men

00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:07,749
then it is the case that it's harder for

00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:11,740
women to get in and then and I read an

00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:14,169
article several years ago that basically

00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,570
laid out the mathematics of racism and

00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:18,490
why racism is in fact a natural state of

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:21,340
affairs and it was a very uncomfortable

00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,869
article for a lot of liberals to read

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,429
but the mathematics is actually pretty

00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:27,159
sound and it goes into the history of

00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:31,179
the Rwanda genocide and it goes into the

00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:34,509
the race riots in in watts in California

00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:36,549
and about how naturally over time if

00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:39,129
people feel that there is a difference

00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:41,440
between one group and another they will

00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:43,179
naturally gravitate and isolate

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,610
themselves and about the the idea that

00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:47,259
white flight which is this phenomenon of

00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:50,769
inner cities in the United States being

00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:53,679
abandoned to to the the black American

00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:55,360
community and having the whites moved to

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,669
the suburbs that this kind of

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,320
stratification of social groups and the

00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:01,179
separation of one group from the other

00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,759
is a natural outcome whenever people do

00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:05,049
not feel as if they're all part of the

00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,809
same group whenever those differences

00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:10,540
are felt there's a natural separation so

00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:12,460
if we believe that having more women

00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,960
involved in Debian is valuable it is

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,560
something that requires a conscious

00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,359
effort to overcome this kind of natural

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,450
separating out of different social

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,490
groups because people do feel that they

00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:26,619
are not part of a group or part of a

00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,510
group in some cases based on gender and

00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:30,159
that is a cultural reality that I think

00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,799
we all need to acknowledge

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,030
and if this is something you so under s

00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:35,470
you've made the comment that you don't

00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,780
know what you could do differently if

00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:40,510
you do think that we should have a more

00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,679
equal gender based gender ratio in

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,480
Debian if you think this is something

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,730
that should be fixed it is something

00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,940
that requires an active effort and this

00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,960
is basically the fundamental basis of

00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,760
affirmative action in the United States

00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,760
and other systems and while you may find

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,770
that for for your local community that's

00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,359
not how people feel when you look at the

00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,710
wider world and when you look at some of

00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:01,150
the countries where where Debian

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,559
developers come from it is an issue and

00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:08,890
it does require a conscious effort on

00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:12,010
our part to overcome that I was thinking

00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:15,069
about what you are saying and it's like

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:20,020
we are trying to find a solution and

00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:23,109
women are not all the same so I think

00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,180
trying to find one unique solution is

00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:29,730
very difficult I think having Debian

00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:32,530
women as a group is it's good because

00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:35,559
you know you are welcome only to have

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:41,950
the name but we have to have in mind

00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:45,309
that we cannot treat women as well that

00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:48,160
we have our behavior is the same or

00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:50,589
something like this because we are few

00:35:48,160 --> 00:36:07,690
women here and I think we are not the

00:35:50,589 --> 00:36:09,430
same at all so it's my the thing is we

00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:12,010
need to start assuming that people know

00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,559
things both men and women of course but

00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:17,079
I am the first to admit that when I see

00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:20,980
a woman here I kind of ask myself why

00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:23,140
she's here I don't like it with myself

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:26,020
but I do it I don't ask her of course

00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,670
but I ask myself it's that if she here

00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,349
with someone or is she here because she

00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,809
is a DD or

00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:35,650
so I'm thinking that we can do about

00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:39,250
this is of course try to just okay I

00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:41,589
will for this time and from now on just

00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,720
assume that she is awesome that she's

00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:51,340
it's like the most super

00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:54,160
around here on that note before we

00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:57,160
continue I was actually asked if I'm

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,320
here because because death camp is gonna

00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:03,280
be in Portland next year I was I was

00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:05,530
asked that this year know I've been here

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,780
several times and I've been in the

00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,790
community many times I've made many

00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,550
community members mad at me

00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:16,540
many I promise you I am as good at

00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:18,310
blaming people as you guys are so yeah

00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,080
on that note thank you thank you for

00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:25,150
bringing that up as I was trying very

00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:28,240
hard not to but since you did I can't so

00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,849
the point is it's well we already talked

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,460
about some of these but I wanted to to

00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:35,920
point Wow even if it's quite late

00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:40,690
because we've already talked yeah so

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:43,869
what's been doing that might help to get

00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:45,520
as more women well in the first place we

00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:49,300
all we already know that women are

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,910
capable and interested and we already we

00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:54,099
we've already gotten to make Debian more

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:56,770
work I mean to new people even when it's

00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:59,830
still not where we would want it to be

00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:02,470
it's still very more welcoming there's

00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:04,800
the diversity statement which is a great

00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:07,270
great accomplishment and a great wording

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,490
there's we have the harassment mail

00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,530
address which we all hope it would be

00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,630
absolutely unneeded but it's there a

00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,609
note about that to the anti-harassment

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,770
list even though it does say anti

00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:19,660
harassment it is open for anybody who is

00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,720
experiencing some sort of very

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:25,560
uncomfortable situation that they need

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,680
help resolving it's not just meant for

00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,260
what we would normally label us

00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:35,589
harassment just wanted that out there

00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:38,609
yeah we have we have had for a long time

00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:40,869
Devyn Community Guidelines you know Rico

00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:43,060
and we know that the new material

00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:46,270
process is continuously being improved

00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:48,490
and we all will really have more

00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,920
initiatives right now that are

00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:54,000
encouraging for more people from every

00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,690
every for everywhere every

00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,690
type of people to to join Debian that's

00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:04,200
the for example it's being discussed the

00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:07,970
the Debian were coming team and there's

00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,960
also going there has been some ongoing

00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:13,950
controversial stuff about the code of

00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:17,430
conduct and and different stuff and they

00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:19,590
will still know what we did we still

00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,750
know some some things though and we

00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:25,050
still know that from what we've been

00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:27,270
talking about to all the women and what

00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:31,350
we feed ourselves and the new internal

00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:33,120
process can be intimidating the the

00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:35,520
making the the step for example the

00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,870
mentoring process that has already been

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:43,740
mentioned here it's quite intimidating

00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:45,960
to in some aspects because it it assumes

00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,210
it's a the mentoring process and every

00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,760
mentoring process usually it's taught as

00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:54,240
a salon at least a medium term

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,820
commitment and that scares people so

00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,850
maybe the world coming team might be a

00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:03,780
good approach for this first stage what

00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:05,610
I means that most of the women gets men

00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,550
too but most of the women at least I

00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:10,230
know and find it scary to just join

00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:12,180
Debian and not knowing anyone and

00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:15,170
writing the mailing list or joining a

00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,520
group where they don't know anyone and a

00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:21,360
personal approach seems to be working

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,360
better that's probably the whole whole

00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:27,690
point of mentorship program and the

00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,190
welcoming program and stuff so it's so

00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:32,280
it's a good thing that we go throughout

00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:34,320
deadlines and we are able to to provide

00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,860
some some initial contact in places

00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:43,400
someone you can ask how does it work

00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:46,080
someone who's friendly and and then

00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,630
regarding different proposals or

00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:53,670
different things that different things

00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:58,380
that we could do well we made we might

00:40:53,670 --> 00:41:01,470
need some ways to get people more easily

00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,080
involved one of the best biggest step

00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:07,020
for joining most of the three social

00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,900
projects but particularly more

00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:12,570
three celebrates but the Debian general

00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,940
is you don't know where to start you

00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:17,340
don't have a clear path for entering the

00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,680
the it was mentioned that maybe lack of

00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:24,020
tutorials lack of mentoring lack of

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:27,000
staff and we might need to make some

00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:30,150
more active outreach and maybe make him

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,710
more visibly more visible but it was

00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,080
mentioned at the beginning that there

00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:37,400
are many ways to contribute things maybe

00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:44,310
the thinking the thinking people

00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:46,440
proposal flow Rico's might help and this

00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:49,590
year was the first year that Debian

00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,780
participated in the gnome opw project or

00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:55,980
the outreach program for women trying to

00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:58,230
draw women into technology more I really

00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:03,750
want to thank Zach wherever he went for

00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:06,720
his work on that it it we didn't end up

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:09,240
giving out an internship for this but we

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,840
did have four women actually show

00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,910
interest and want to be involved and

00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:17,190
three of them were also google Summer of

00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,200
Code so we managed to bring in one

00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,270
person just interested in the opw

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,950
project and that I think was a success

00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:28,380
right there at least for our first very

00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:30,420
short attempt so we have like a couple

00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,070
of minutes in case someone wants to say

00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,550
something

00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:38,220
yeah I had a is always it's often

00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,990
related to how we explain Debian to

00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,900
people we meet and ask and are

00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:45,240
interested and especially to our people

00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,100
who do not have like a technical

00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,130
background people who are not geeks

00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:55,680
that applies you a lot of women that I

00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:58,200
mean and it's that actually gbn is not a

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,560
technical project is lexical project but

00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,200
you team ultimately given is a social

00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:07,590
project it's about freedom and it's

00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,480
about how we control the machines and

00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,710
not have the machines controlling us and

00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,440
this is something that is actually

00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,619
appealing to more people than if I just

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,559
say yeah

00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:20,019
I could and this is something that I

00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:35,589
liked I want to emphasis more and that

00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:37,539
might help I think I I see two reason to

00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:42,539
ever have been women project one is

00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:47,349
inclusion and one is reaction to

00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:50,980
situations those situations that happen

00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:53,769
because well there is minority and some

00:43:50,980 --> 00:44:01,210
people are not made comfortable in in

00:43:53,769 --> 00:44:05,710
something and I so I think this these

00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:08,740
two roles are not fulfilled as good as

00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:11,410
they would be because there is currently

00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:18,039
one single point for everything

00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:21,970
so with regards to inclusion I think

00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:25,119
that is a situation where as we say not

00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:31,420
only women need inclusion new developers

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:33,849
there may be reaching out to bring

00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:37,059
people in need not be specific to women

00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:38,859
I mean it doesn't mean that we don't

00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:42,609
need to bring in women but that's an

00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:45,910
effort that's useful for lots more the

00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:48,759
other thing which is dealing with issues

00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:54,339
that happen because women are minority

00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:56,589
can probably benefit well when things

00:44:54,339 --> 00:45:00,190
happen on the street that makes someone

00:44:56,589 --> 00:45:04,359
uncomfortable it's useful to be able to

00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:05,980
look at somebody familiar and say did

00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:09,279
you see what I've seen

00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:12,160
was it just me and weed I don't think we

00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:12,549
have a place in Debian where that can

00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,430
happen

00:45:12,549 --> 00:45:18,009
Debian women definitely cannot happen

00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:20,319
you cannot forward a private email to

00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:22,480
Debian women and ask people for comments

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,190
that publicly archived in Google the

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,330
person that sent you that email may be

00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:29,900
on there been women

00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:33,380
so how would you feel about having a

00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:35,570
women-only mailing list I would my

00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:39,080
personal feeling is that I would be for

00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:41,300
that I think that helps and whenever I

00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:44,230
personally have been in a position in

00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,910
which the one who would you describe I

00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:49,190
wasn't able to rely on and the Debian

00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:52,070
womens mailing list and I had I had to

00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:54,500
go to Lima chicks or sometimes when you

00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:56,690
want to women but different women didn't

00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:07,160
work for that so maybe I think it would

00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:10,550
be a good proposal great so we only yeah

00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,470
we're and I have so I have like 10

00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:15,170
seconds to describe this because that's

00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:18,680
out of time to me basically what can we

00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:20,600
do find out why those women around you

00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,500
not not all women that's that's silly

00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:26,420
but the the women who are clearly using

00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,130
Debian the women who are interested in

00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,020
improving dubbing the women who are

00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,609
actually interested or would be

00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,320
interested in this community find out

00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:35,840
why they're not getting involved listen

00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:38,600
to them their concerns are not silly

00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,220
don't tell them they're silly validate

00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,690
their concerns they're valid because

00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:45,080
they're that's what's keeping them from

00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:46,820
being involved and point them to Debian

00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:50,540
women because we can help them from

00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:53,630
there and by the way when I say we it's

00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:55,250
not just us it's the entire Debian

00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:57,950
community if you want to be involved in

00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:59,990
Debian women I don't care who you are

00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:03,980
please come be involved in Debian women

00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:05,570
we want you to remind though remind them

00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,609
that there are other paths to being

00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,170
involved in Debian other than being a

00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:10,730
programmer other than being an IT

00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,920
specialist other than being a network

00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:14,600
administrator you can do other

00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:19,700
contributions to Debian that will

00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:21,350
