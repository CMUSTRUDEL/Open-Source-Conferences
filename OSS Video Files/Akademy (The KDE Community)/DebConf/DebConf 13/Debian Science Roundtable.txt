well this is the deviant science Bob I

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,750
have not prepared a lot of stuff because

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,700
it's become an event to get some input I

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,730
just have a favor prepared my usual

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,699
graphs who is an avian science team it

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,820
is these people who are uploading

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:27,840
packages which are now considered as the

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:34,500
event science well people just the first

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:44,190
names you will know them to somebody

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:49,110
else then be heads a pkv sky khon crew

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,420
which is it's not really existing

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,690
anymore we should probably merge also

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,949
the graphs to make some real image the

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,980
thing was in in 2006 or 7 there was

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,930
another group created which basically

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:10,590
the same things and nobody was aware who

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:12,990
and so we saw this this is about the

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,990
discussion on the Debian signs the user

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,560
list there are some other people showing

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,630
up somehow which is fine because some

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,270
people are discussing more than

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,180
providing code but this is also valuable

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,780
input this is a deviant science

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:35,340
developer mailing list we talk about

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:38,909
actual agate ring issues is also you

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,479
can't loose bomb I think he is more here

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,850
because of his COO a work then actually

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,420
doing something and it would be good if

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,570
if he would reach that the QA people are

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,509
not showing up on the top 10 people it

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,329
would be nice it's cool a is something

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,759
not so important anymore and I know

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,189
Matias closes is the same he's not in

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,600
the room but he's frequently criticizing

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,600
Debian science

00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,070
it would be nine here deciding is fine

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:14,780
but it could be a little bit more nice

00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:17,660
more friendly so same for this mailing

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,500
list these are the bag handles people

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,300
who are fixing bugs deviant science it

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:28,700
would be also nice if there are some

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:31,220
more people you know and sky computers

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:36,380
also back handles and the commits to the

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:41,390
Debian science VCS this mall has matched

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:45,710
to the uploads and in piggies

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:48,200
pkg sky Kampf well and I would like to

00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:51,260
repeat my slide from the morning what I

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,520
understand is a team it's just waking up

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,500
in the morning and realizing that

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,720
somebody is it solves your problem from

00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:02,060
yesterday and this is I have observed

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,000
this frequently in Debian made team and

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,890
in science we have a lot of packages and

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,360
a lot of people who are working in

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:13,270
parallel which is a sign that even

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,880
science is some kind of umbrella for a

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:20,420
lot of scientific stuff my vision would

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,150
be that we could a little bit split

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,520
these Sciences in topics like

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:29,120
mathematics physics electronics and so

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:33,670
and science is left over for some

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:38,180
general things like graphing that are

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:43,489
publishing and something like this well

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:46,519
yeah or some packages in some topics we

00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:49,060
have Pegasus from chemistry if Pegasus

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,390
from electronics and engineering

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:57,890
geography and so forth and so on and I

00:03:52,390 --> 00:04:00,140
had made this graph somehow well deviant

00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,900
science packets picketers exists since

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:09,050
2009 and so the development over four

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:12,230
years is not that visible like for for

00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:14,780
Debian mates for 10 years but what I'm

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,500
missing is a little bit the increasing

00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:21,030
tendency yeah

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,370
kind of stagnating I will not say it's

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,920
good or bad and just saying it's a fact

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,980
that it's more or less the same number

00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,160
with the exception here of geography but

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,380
I think the point is rather that that

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,500
eyes have more sitting down and adding

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,750
the geography packages to the tasks and

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,180
not that we have more packages it was

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,180
just a matter of maintaining the task

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:55,169
well this is what yeah what what does it

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:57,210
mean yes the question is this direction

00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,490
is clear that others it's the topics a

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,290
meta package and this is other releases

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:07,710
of the Debian science this is Steve and

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:12,600
science 1.0 this debian science say 0.9

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:25,710
demons and 0.8 also the the meta package

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:28,560
releases of Debian science topic axis

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,130
yes chemistry electronics and something

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,380
in the middle

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:36,110
I cannot interpolate chemistry and

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:39,000
electronics to give a valid topic well

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:43,979
it is service we have to be on science

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:53,640
and it is assembly of some sciences you

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:57,419
know wait a minute wait a minute oh yeah

00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:01,740
yeah yeah okay it is yeah I have just

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:05,220
shown the the tasks which are which have

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,640
a lot of packages okay yeah this is okay

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:14,910
you are locking this one yeah the one

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,210
with the peak is mathematics okay it's

00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,169
okay

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:24,220
oh you know you know thing what's

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:27,310
possible yeah okay

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,890
so this is a comparison with stevia

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,870
Midway I see this some kind of

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,980
development that we get more it's just

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:44,230
them but if I draw a cut here it's

00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:47,950
probably also quite similar well in

00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:50,170
recent def cons we had a wiki page which

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,800
which has the title problems to work on

00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:58,590
and I would like to continue with this

00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,040
we can also work in gobby which can be

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:04,450
done like this

00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:06,970
install a copy infinite copy - C Java

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:10,500
dot even dot org and you will find the

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:14,440
document which I have also opened here

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:19,590
and here's also the wiki page with the

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,590
problems we we should discuss here I

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:30,450
will open this also in the browser

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:34,620
I should have preferences better

00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,620
she's a wine party ok

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:57,470
so it's it's always burning topic we

00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:05,420
have we want to create big tech files

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:07,700
and historically there were some people

00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,460
who are providing directly patek files

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:15,320
we had some stuff in Debian copyrights

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:18,020
we had some deviant / big files and we

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,660
have city be an upstream file the Debian

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:25,130
upstream file is what currently is

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:30,410
implemented and I don't know how much it

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:35,080
is used the result is what we can do

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:37,460
this is Debian upstream files contain

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:44,120
scientific publication information and

00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:53,510
I'm importing this into you didi and no

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:57,250
hopes badly prepared sorry and from you

00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:01,130
didi and generating a PDF file which

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:06,320
shows all the publications information

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:09,920
we have in Debian packages so I announce

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:16,670
this in in on the mailing list one year

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:24,670
ago or so and is anybody using this did

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:28,339
you get the mic the PDF is not the very

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:30,410
nice format for text in my opinion well

00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:34,310
it starts to display what we have this

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:39,200
is just to check the result I'm using

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:42,130
I'm importing plain text from from these

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,510
upstream files put them in you ready

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,280
that's that's what I want to do and just

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:49,010
to see if it works

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,740
if all the literature can be converted

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,510
to a big file which can be processed by

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,810
a techie this is how to generate that

00:09:53,510 --> 00:10:00,300
does just to verify that it works ok the

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:03,030
PDF it does some right you would hit

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:07,230
potentially useful to have an HTML

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:12,300
export as well if you know a wave from

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:14,210
large tool - yeah I guess check for each

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,210
team might work but yeah that's always a

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,210
minefield

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:37,910
yonis volunteers ah great so you don't

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:48,960
need to speak if you volunteers oh it's

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:50,490
yeah so do you want to use it I did pan

00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,170
dock that was the only word I wanted to

00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:58,290
hand up hand up is the tool that can

00:10:52,170 --> 00:11:00,450
convert and include the and you here yes

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,850
I don't volunteer we have a bib tech

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,630
fire and you can do something with it

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:09,390
thank you fine the big tech files also

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:13,020
on the same location I can resend the

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:15,480
mayor about the location and you DeeDee

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,700
query it on the mailing list and are you

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:23,820
reading deviant science mailing list why

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:29,850
not yes I send it to you future tense

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:34,470
yes I will read the milanese okay that's

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:38,340
great but finally I think the the main

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:45,240
use for for the publication's is rather

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:49,050
than the task page we have I don't know

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,480
if maybe on the depiction you can really

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:57,650
see it as well friends don't even a dog

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,650
baby they are making also use of this

00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:05,340
yes using it the main use of the

00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:10,290
publication is currently on the tasks

00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:13,050
pages where it is displayed here to to

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,010
make sure that upstream developers of

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,110
the software gets

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:21,570
actually every word and and we have also

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:26,010
this please register thing so the main

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:29,130
thing about putting these citations

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:31,620
somewhere is to to ensure that the

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:34,110
appszoom outdoors get some extra hits

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,690
also for their citation and see that the

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,200
DVR is friendly to them this is the main

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,340
thing

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:44,010
I have no no other application for for

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:49,230
this don't know if you see some other

00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:51,960
applications that means in other words

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:55,620
do you agree that we just stick to this

00:12:51,960 --> 00:13:04,320
upstream file and and remove this to do

00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:05,970
topic from the from the wiki it's what

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,340
do you think it's it's done now we are

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:14,990
happy vs. David this is ok also well if

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,990
there are no opinions then it's ok

00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:24,439
I mean big tech files are helpful I

00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:27,529
guess but I mean is it hard to just get

00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:28,849
some parser that creates a big tech code

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:30,679
block I mean that's what probably the

00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:33,019
easiest then we can have one file and

00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:35,689
this is what I said I'm importing this

00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:37,759
each package has a DB an upstream file

00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:40,159
this TV on upstream file is imported

00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:44,089
into you DD and they exists in query

00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:47,749
that generates one big tech file which

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,819
is not installed but it's there you can

00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:51,769
you can get it okay I was more thinking

00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:54,019
about if I worked in my laptop and then

00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,999
just start to write my thesis whatever

00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:57,889
I'd like to get all those files

00:13:55,999 --> 00:14:00,379
generated on my laptop I mean if kind of

00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:03,679
course just pulled it from the HTTP you

00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:05,329
can pull this or you can we can even

00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,089
package this but I don't think that's

00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:10,669
maintainable because it's it's in flux

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:14,239
if every new upload could bring a new

00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:16,189
publication no I would package the tool

00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:19,909
that creates from the install software a

00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:22,159
table tag file if that's easy but that

00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:26,209
was just an idea this is a simple shell

00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:28,909
script two lines of well the SQL query

00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:31,249
is a little bit longer but yeah it's not

00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:34,819
really a package you can log in to

00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:36,529
Elliott and just do the query it should

00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:39,030
be a little bit better documented parts

00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:43,000
yeah

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,920
right so the point is I mean I guess

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,690
it's interesting to just get everything

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,330
you have what do you have installed but

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:52,330
we don't install the upstream files on

00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,790
the incentive packages so you always

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,190
have to query you DD otherwise or do we

00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,630
break so you could install the upstream

00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,330
file into the package and then just

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,730
crawl your little file system yeah but

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:06,730
with them and the lysosome fights out

00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,590
German files this is not a sure you

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,330
always have to generate something on it

00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,620
yeah of course again but I mean to do

00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:17,080
locally otherwise you always need

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:22,530
network why don't we like install them

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,530
and user share doc or something yeah we

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,920
could agree to say well right DEP help

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,070
of science or something like this which

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:38,940
looks for upstream files and moves it to

00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:38,940
use of your science package name also

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,040
you know something like this but it's

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,540
actually these Tramel files are not yet

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,630
usable that way

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,790
you also need a script what finally

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:27,520
process everything what what they are

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:36,570
into a big thick file also but it's also

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:36,570
easy to create yes

00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,120
they say her science would be

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,620
development time that you make sure to

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,620
include something into the package and

00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,710
what I see also what you were talking

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,320
about is the at runtime you could

00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:00,750
optionally install something that was as

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,230
a trigger to packaging trigger that you

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:07,530
generate extracts from your file system

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,530
the lipstick data and store it somewhere

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,300
yeah you can do that it's like usual

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:16,170
always updates a bit take file every

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:18,390
time it is a bit these channel files it

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:21,240
will regenerate the picture the question

00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:24,420
is which other parts of the upstream

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,930
file are interesting if your data

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:31,020
science just put just generates the big

00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:33,870
cache file at package generation time

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,840
and puts just a bit - file in the binary

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:40,220
package then no triggers no nothing you

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,680
have just half the information you need

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:46,590
yes if you if you want to make to limit

00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,980
yourself to only have it you're working

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:53,040
for a big check yes if you instead at

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:56,580
the user space or the runtime the tool

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,530
make it a TV files so that you could

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,990
hook into it and do other things then

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,990
big check extraction I'm not

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,880
volunteering for this no I'm not the one

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,660
who said that it was two lines of shells

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,790
good well it's the extraction of all the

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:16,980
possible is actually I posted this

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:19,230
transcript no I'm one achieving not for

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,510
the trigger well my I might do it but

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,870
I'm too naughty cleared but getting all

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:27,180
the citations in India and we have it's

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,950
just done it's it's posted on the

00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:34,440
mailing list it's you read equally so

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:38,910
but and actually there the upstream

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:43,450
files currently contain this references

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:48,650
and para

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:53,750
the contains the references and they

00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:57,880
might contain something like from the

00:18:53,750 --> 00:19:04,250
division team I have seen this oops

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:06,520
Oh reason why and this is too dominant

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,520
today

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,090
what we also have in the upstream files

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:28,720
is where you should register register

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:32,830
for all software it's the problem is sum

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,620
up streams are depending from from the

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:38,590
number of users that are using their

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,840
software and so they put usually on

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:45,100
every page even if we software a button

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:48,400
please register and we let us know how

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,490
many people are using software and when

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:56,640
building a debian package we somehow

00:19:50,490 --> 00:20:00,100
circumvents is a system and so we try to

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:06,150
help them to get the data anyway what we

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:10,480
can provide is the popcorn values so but

00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:13,530
mostly these are not very reliable so it

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,720
would be better if people will register

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:22,990
this is some data we can use for Debian

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:24,670
science and upstream and I think we said

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:28,510
was what are you using as well

00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:32,740
you have another data point I think if

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:34,810
not well you are this you are using ah

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,060
we can donate donation we have also

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:41,140
donation so the the way where you can

00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:43,120
donate something these are three data

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,670
entries which what are interesting in

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,470
the debian upstream files for Debian

00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:56,020
science

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:57,790
otherwise I don't know well no debug

00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:02,200
reports are not in the Debian absinthe I

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:06,570
said the upstream files are then it

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,730
might be a place we are to point to an

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,790
upstream backtrack or in upstream setup

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,570
and

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:16,910
certain certain URL where you can inject

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:20,780
sir bucks but the event obscene files

00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:22,280
only try to collect data which is

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,140
related to upstream and the back

00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:30,560
supports are not obscene these are the

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:33,020
stabian stuff so this is not not so and

00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,720
and I also seem to be in deviant science

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,970
we have basically so specific software

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,030
that that do not the author's do not

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,940
mind about setting up the Box Wakasa

00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:50,800
string system I've quite rarely seen it

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:59,150
I have seen it but it's it's real so

00:21:50,800 --> 00:22:07,340
what is yeah this this comes up from

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:10,870
time to time and yeah I have a comment

00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:13,400
on the upstream stuff recently I saw

00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:16,250
well we can't have these publication

00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:21,590
information and sometimes we have the

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:22,970
URL to the printed version yes and what

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,150
I recently saw is that apparently there

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:29,990
is this open archive initiative or

00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:33,290
something where you can put archive like

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,330
with an X or whatever I'd like reprints

00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:38,090
of PDFs which are open access and freely

00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,770
Weibull hmm and it seems to be some kind

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,100
of initiative and we you should look at

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:47,260
that so if there is a paper and it's

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:50,690
behind a paywall we rather point to the

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,340
open archive initiative or what I'm I'm

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,640
not questioning what the thing is right

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:59,170
now yeah that seems because sometimes

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,720
you have Nazis this tech which is called

00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:07,660
epub I can show you by the way I can

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,660
show you the deposit potential fields

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:24,649
absolu meter data is a wiki page syntax

00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:28,010
fields this is a reference field and you

00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:30,679
have a German formatted files and you

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:33,139
can in there are multiple entries for

00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,059
the references and all are regarded on

00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:38,889
the on the tasks page is only the only

00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:43,159
the first one registration of repository

00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:49,190
yeah screenshots this is straight that

00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:51,649
is a general thing donation yeah

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,840
back submit and park databases these are

00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:56,019
the points where if there is a obscene

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,850
back trigger but it's also not very

00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:00,950
science Pacific it you should if you

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,590
know this you should insert it isn't

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:07,250
even obscene files who's using they went

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:12,799
upstream files in these packages it's

00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:15,850
not that common there's also a DEP about

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,850
these upstream files

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:29,320
so back to the topic as I said in the

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,950
beginning do we need either more

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,770
fine-grained tasks more fine-grained in

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:38,440
the sent that mathematics is quite a

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:43,630
large beast or electronics is quite

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:47,440
large piece or to be rather one to

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:50,190
create a new blend which is as I said in

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,480
this morning quite somber but

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,750
potentially work the worst doing it if

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,020
if there are some three four or five

00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:03,870
people working on the same field you

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:07,990
have quite a lot of people in astronomy

00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:10,809
and so do you think do you personally

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:14,919
think you would consider running your

00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:22,169
own blend and making some subset what is

00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:25,529
assemble in science no oh you don't have

00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:30,510
they don't want a really fun out of it

00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:30,510
well nobody can force you to volunteer

00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:39,220
well the next topic would be make better

00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:47,789
use of depth X who is step taking his

00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:52,600
packages are really two and a half three

00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:54,580
person so for yes the problem I was

00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,830
discussing with my who with some of

00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,620
course student who is rewriting the meta

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:03,669
packaged stuff we really want to merge

00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:07,210
the depth X with supplants techniques

00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:10,840
and the problem is we have no no match

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:13,419
between all the depth X it might work

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,970
for science but I doubt that that every

00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:20,230
task file is covered by an in according

00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:24,340
depth X file or depth egg and we also

00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:28,179
can't rely on the fact that packages are

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:30,700
really depth checked so do we have any

00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:32,500
idea of how we could increase this

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:37,600
should we make some

00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:38,980
more of better depth X or it is fine as

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,810
it is yeah

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:44,170
are you using depth X if you're not

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:50,470
taking there are ways to install VR

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:52,720
depth X also as always if if it comes

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,880
into characterization of packages all

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,830
the people say well there's depth X yes

00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:03,160
there's depth X but if it comes to the

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:11,590
usage of depth X yes I don't know why do

00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:13,240
we have depth X if nobody's using it you

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:18,220
really don't really even if you need

00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:20,650
yeah the problem is for me that users

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:24,520
who are new today beyond don't find

00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:28,030
their stuff they are not not real stuff

00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,550
I I personally think that the plain

00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:33,850
techniques as we are using are quite

00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:37,600
helpful to say what's inside Debian I

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:40,930
just created some stuff just to tell my

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,950
colleagues what's there and depth X is

00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:48,340
an alternative way and and I think we we

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,720
don't care good enough for our users to

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,120
telling them what they are we are

00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,160
putting you were putting one package

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,090
after the other into the archive because

00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,160
we need it ourselves

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:02,500
that's okay this is a main motivation

00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:05,350
but we fail in telling our users what's

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:12,040
there and how they could profit from

00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:15,850
this work one one example of how depth X

00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:18,760
is realtor real use is if you try

00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:22,330
install the package go play go play go

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,700
play was originally written for games so

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:27,310
you could find out find the kind of

00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:31,240
games that you like and it is pulling

00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:33,670
off that depending on the depth checking

00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,280
of games so you can say well give me all

00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,200
the bought games that is currently

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,000
installed on my system and then it also

00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,700
links up with the with the screenshots

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,710
yes screenshots is maybe not the kind of

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,440
thing that is most funky and interesting

00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,360
for science people

00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,190
but for some things it might be for

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,080
visualizations you might be interested

00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,540
in what kinds of examples of

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,390
visualizations could this tool produce

00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,300
but but even if you're not using this

00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:04,290
part of it then the navigation is very

00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,940
user friendly and it was hacked into

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:10,150
supporting also navigating educational

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,500
stuff go learn and I don't remember the

00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:14,800
other ones but it has been split into

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:17,520
like you have multiple use cases angles

00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,750
into the Debian archival packages and

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,000
obviously it could be used for for

00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,970
Debian science also science related

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,760
packages but only shows those that are

00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,830
checked up so here you can browse the

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,970
tagged packages so even if you don't

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:35,380
need it some of your users might need it

00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:39,670
I'd say anybody who could fix your

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:43,150
script that this doesn't blink so this

00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:47,350
is these are some use cases for for

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:49,270
screenshots in in science right I don't

00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,550
have an idea for why this is blinking

00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:58,240
this is I'm not a JavaScript program I

00:29:51,550 --> 00:30:01,180
just took this over so yeah you use one

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,860
of the image display libraries they look

00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,690
overkill but some of them are very

00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,900
lightweight and yeah this is also some

00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:10,870
library but Paul is the wrong one I it's

00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:21,250
not my coach it's just some but perhaps

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:24,070
we talk together so but just I think we

00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:27,190
could also I think it's more than go

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,470
play there's also go something there are

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:35,730
multiple but I don't remember the you

00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:35,730
know I actually recognized the

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,590
importance of having things stack and

00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:46,480
actually when every member I tried to

00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:49,000
talk my my packages I still I I never

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,750
felt the need of resorting to that

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,690
depth-x

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,429
myself to solve the problem I had but

00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:58,480
maybe I was just lucky or too

00:30:54,429 --> 00:31:01,919
lucky I have to say that there is a

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:06,039
thing I'm somewhat concerned for about

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,230
which is the fact that beside of course

00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:11,860
the the package the the main package

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:17,619
metadata that we keep in the main

00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:20,820
archive along with the control files we

00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:24,450
have quite a few other databases of

00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:28,269
metadata about Debian packages which are

00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:33,100
more or less independent there is

00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:37,720
depth-x there are information contained

00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:39,490
in the Debian plans and probably others

00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:46,360
they do not come to my mind at this

00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:48,610
moment and I I think it'd be it would it

00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,240
would be easier if all this set of

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,789
metadata

00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:55,990
were not collected on different website

00:31:51,789 --> 00:32:00,179
with different interfaces different way

00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:04,149
to modify them but if there was some

00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:06,970
okay sort of a better way to access to

00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:11,909
all of them with a consistent user

00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:16,480
experience I think that this would

00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:19,960
enhance a lot the usability of these

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,330
kind of metadata yeah well we have

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,710
actually not so many we have two methods

00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:29,289
and I don't regard these two methods as

00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,499
competing because one thing you can't

00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:35,320
approach with depth X you can't least

00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:38,889
not yet available packages which the

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,440
blend stuff can do we have some I should

00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:45,869
probably switch to the Debian made stuff

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,869
where it's I just know it better

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:59,110
we are listing stuff which is trusting

00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:02,110
our SVN or in new rights these packages

00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:05,429
are in you and you can't DEP take

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,570
something what is new right and we are

00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:11,440
listing something which is just in

00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:16,690
version control system you can't work

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,010
with this so this is one reason why we

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:22,270
can't use depth-x

00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:26,380
exclusively right but what we could do

00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:30,039
is to say well if there's a DEP tech

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:33,789
there is no requirement to put this in

00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:37,059
the task file what we could say or meter

00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:40,510
you step take something and this could

00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:43,630
also work with the blends framework this

00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,940
would be your common interface but to

00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,350
come back to your point you say you

00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,510
don't depth checked and you use don't

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:52,419
use task files because you're confused

00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:59,890
would would you use one if you are there

00:33:52,419 --> 00:34:02,890
would be only one system speaking only

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:06,250
for myself yeah okay okay I personally I

00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:08,889
know about the tax and blends in that my

00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:12,490
case is just that I never happened to

00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:18,490
fill the need of it but I think in

00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:23,380
general I and well and as a as a

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:29,330
developer I would be more motivated to

00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:36,320
contributing to this this this meta data

00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:42,280
repositories if okay it would be odd if

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:45,170
I didn't have to understand again how

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,260
one specific metadata service works

00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:51,260
every time I need to for example I'm not

00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:54,800
I'd not push a new package in archive

00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:57,050
every day so if I do it after six months

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,690
from from the last one of course I have

00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:03,650
to at least check again the help files

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:07,040
the guidelines to okay remind me what

00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:11,710
what am I supposed to actually do and if

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:15,370
this requires going to a few different

00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:17,570
web pages to a few different service

00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:20,390
because they they are independent they

00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:23,300
ship there okay there are independent

00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:27,350
one from each other that's more

00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:29,780
difficult yes but as I use and the same

00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:33,770
thing as a user although it's not

00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:36,110
specifically it doesn't specifically

00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:38,210
happen to me I agree with you but what

00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:40,700
about if you trust send an email to Devi

00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:43,370
on science list I have uploaded a

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,950
package in the which foot fit endoscope

00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:49,640
electronics physics and please edit for

00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:51,470
me to the browser it is okay for you you

00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,310
don't need to read any send an email and

00:35:51,470 --> 00:36:05,230
I will put those two packages into the

00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:08,630
TAS friends done maybe it is it's okay

00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:12,440
mainly concerned about is having to do a

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:14,630
different thing for each for each

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,440
different context in which I have to

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:20,480
operate for example if I have to push

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,970
science package maybe I have to write

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,820
two different science mailing lists

00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,570
if I have to to push another package for

00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:31,340
another

00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:33,620
maybe the the workflow there is

00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,840
different and instead of writing an

00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:39,860
email they for example ask me to go on

00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,480
our website and at the the the my

00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:46,220
package name to the to a to-do list

00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:48,650
another team may ask it's not that no

00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:53,110
it's not that fractionate it's it just

00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:57,080
well maybe it's not but ok the point is

00:36:53,110 --> 00:37:01,820
having something that easily reminds you

00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:05,090
of that without requiring you to check a

00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:07,220
lot of documentation just to find the

00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,250
the single line the tell that tells you

00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,540
the single thing to do I think you

00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:17,210
describe it more complicated than it

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:21,350
really is it also depends on fact that I

00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:23,450
never even thought at writing to some

00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:27,050
mailing list or what what I'm doing is

00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:32,480
I'm watching V and the W NPP if people

00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:35,480
are submitting a W and P P or ITP Park

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,030
about something that sounds scientific I

00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,040
always write to this person would you

00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,110
please consider it's intimating

00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,200
intuitive and science team or something

00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:47,900
like this and in what task you would

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,270
think it would fit best on what tasks

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,560
yes I just added I just I'm just doing

00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:56,690
all the work but I need the information

00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:59,030
because I can't I can't really follow

00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,820
everything and I have not even the

00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,260
competence to to follow this stuff so if

00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:06,770
I don't know if in what field you are

00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:08,780
working I think that I could you please

00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:11,270
introduce yourself and say what field

00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:15,500
you okay it's a bit complicated now

00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:17,990
because I'm here and I'm not maintaining

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:21,860
any packages in DBM science although I'm

00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:26,030
considering I'm considering this also

00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:28,040
because until now my main package I was

00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:30,980
working on along with its long list of

00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,020
dependencies was geogebra which is an

00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,680
educational which are actually related

00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,200
to the VN science but I was

00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,650
in it under the Java team yes and it is

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,390
an educational software for mathematics

00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:47,370
geometry like like powered up

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:49,910
rewriting of the kepi software that

00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:52,620
probably is a bit more famous and

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:57,270
unfortunately it recently became non

00:38:52,620 --> 00:39:01,050
free at least later last versions are

00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:02,100
not free anymore and upstream I wrote

00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,480
upstream but they were not very

00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:11,640
interested in to make it free again so

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,440
I'm okay most of the packages I was

00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,270
working on the moment are more or less

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,300
dead are not of my interest anymore

00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:20,630
because I there was just dependencies

00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:24,720
for geogebra which is not going further

00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:27,540
anymore so it's difficult for me to say

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,080
who was I'm working on I'm considering

00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:33,870
to start a bit more working in in Debian

00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:37,980
science I'm I study mathematics for for

00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:42,600
the record and but okay the point is

00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:45,120
that there are I think that most of the

00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,790
difficulty or not of the other things

00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:52,590
you're saying mostly depend on whether

00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:58,010
one is has the abbot of working on there

00:39:52,590 --> 00:40:02,580
or not if okay if you're one if you were

00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:05,760
working on some on your say Debian

00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:08,670
science blender once every week or even

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,340
more you're used to two old procedures

00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:14,010
on the things you have complete workflow

00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,600
in mind my experience is a Debian

00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,910
developer unfortunately is that the

00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:22,140
amount of free time that I have varies a

00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:25,560
lot during the year for example so maybe

00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:28,170
there are some months in which I'm sorry

00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:30,360
if I'm interrupting it's it's not so

00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,700
much what you need to do you can feel

00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:36,690
free to cope to every team I just want

00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:41,070
to we don't fight for for people that I

00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:42,780
put there wasn't no I mean if you if you

00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:45,150
stick to the Java team do your usual

00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,670
maintenance but just give us a signal

00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,640
this package is interesting for these

00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,500
stars and these stars we insert it and

00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,660
you are done there is nothing else to do

00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,090
you are maintaining your packages but if

00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:00,120
you want to see your package in a

00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:02,550
context with other packages which fit

00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,350
somehow and you see the whole picture

00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,310
inside the area and you want to show

00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,650
your colleagues

00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:10,590
well I'm minding maintaining this and

00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:13,340
these other packages fits and you see

00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:16,320
him all assembled on one back web page I

00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:19,710
think this is something what interests

00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:28,140
people and yeah of course it is so I

00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:31,190
wasn't I mean thank you this go play

00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:34,020
tool actually does include a go science

00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:36,000
facet yeah so there's seven different

00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,100
alternatives to go play and one of them

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,720
is go admin and other go learn and then

00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,000
there's go office and go science yeah

00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,970
and if I take go science and say that I

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,890
want to show type mathematics then

00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:48,570
there's a whole pile as a lot a lot

00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,590
mathematic things and one of them is

00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,020
your creeper

00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,880
so specifically for your case you can

00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,760
just lean back and relax someone else

00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,560
has done the in the market coil so so

00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,560
studying the studying of documentation

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:07,350
is finished for you thanks for your

00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:10,380
contributions so the discussion about

00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:14,270
remembering how to do stuff for Debian

00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:18,120
science or I mean not so much enforcing

00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:21,150
team policies as reminding people of of

00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,920
things we're trying to do as a team

00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:26,100
made me think about a discussion we've

00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:30,510
been having on the Perl team of making a

00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:34,590
team specific Linton profile now I'm not

00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:39,030
volunteering for this but so if somebody

00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:41,440
likes you know things thinks that that

00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:43,359
would be valuable

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,130
then I don't know we could discuss it

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,079
further but I just wanted to toss that

00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,869
out there because it it's an interesting

00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:52,630
idea to me because I'm working on a lot

00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:55,089
of different teams and you know most of

00:42:52,630 --> 00:43:02,020
them don't have an upstream file or

00:42:55,089 --> 00:43:04,060
whatever so or it could be hey I see

00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:07,810
you're packaging a new package like the

00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:09,609
P right so a command line basically P so

00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:11,440
I see you're packaging a new package

00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:16,890
would you like to send andreas an email

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:21,430
about the test file or something anyway

00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:26,770
so I think time is close to over any any

00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:29,859
other comments since so I conclude that

00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:32,530
we have some some D H science it was

00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:36,069
also somewhere way below on my to-do

00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:41,170
list but volunteers are perfectly

00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:43,869
welcome and everything else is not

00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:45,790
really changed apples Lynch and we we

00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:48,010
wanted to write something about this

00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:50,710
deviant upstream files you can check the

00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:52,690
references if say this is an inland Gian

00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:55,050
task but it's also general this is not

00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:58,089
not really science specific but

00:43:55,050 --> 00:44:00,970
something with is there somebody who has

00:43:58,089 --> 00:44:05,260
ever written an engine test can do this

00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:11,079
I would have to read the documentation

00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:16,619
how to write in genetics I can I can

00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:20,680
help you write an Indian test yeah okay

00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:22,900
so thank you everybody for for

00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,030
attendance we I think we are sticking to

00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,579
the science topic for today somehow and

00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:33,869
you can keep on discussing discussing

00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:33,869
