so thank you all for coming and I think

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,450
we'll start like mean to use Ashish

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,269
we'll talk about mentorship and other

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,330
floss projects Thanks

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:20,220
so hi everyone I wanted to talk a little

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,570
bit in this session about how other free

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,160
software projects you know have done a

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,920
really good job or sometimes not a great

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,890
job of mentoring and then I want to open

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,720
it up to discussion I have one really

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,030
vivid recommendation that comes from

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,260
reading about all this and hopefully

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,760
we'll talk about that let me quickly ask

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,870
can everyone hear me okay am i speaking

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,239
slowly enough okay I often speak way too

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,600
fast and I often fail to use consonants

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,920
which makes me incomprehensible so I

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,800
hope that you'll tell me if I'm doing

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,480
that maybe just like ah again there's a

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,870
sign of the back of this is slower

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:06,360
please if necessary

00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:10,860
great so the first uh wait ah what I

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:14,729
really oh I see okay I'm gonna do one

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,430
thing great yeah

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,229
so the first free software project wide

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,790
mentorship effort that I heard about is

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,340
you know love which started in about

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,939
December 2004 how many of her have heard

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,310
of genome love all right cool so it's

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,670
how many have heard of genome just take

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,229
him a baseline okay great okay so this

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,640
isn't just like the people raising their

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,100
hands no everything it's that actually

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,140
there's some knowledge gaps so great so

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,570
yeah the point of genome love was to try

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,850
to address the on ramp for genome

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,479
contributions from new volunteers in the

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,430
community and so the first things they

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,380
did were they made a wiki page that had

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,159
recommendations for first-time

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,509
contributions so they linked to

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,280
recommended first tasks in a variety of

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,380
genome sub projects they linked to the

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,110
how to get started developing guide for

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,720
a bunch of genome sub projects and the

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,910
idea was that with that plus the mailing

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,739
list they would find new contributors to

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,220
the project and direct them toward these

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,780
new

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:21,690
these are entry-level contributions and

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,240
hopefully therefore create more sort of

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,070
ad hoc mentorship where people found out

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,700
things that they could work on then God

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,970
help on them

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,370
and shortly after December 2005 in like

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,440
Mark sorry they began in December 2005

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,220
in about March they began in about

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,440
December 2004 and in about March 2005

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,390
they added a Bugzilla tag also so that

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,670
if something has keyword you know them

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,160
love on Bugzilla then that means it's a

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,590
good first task and bugzilla also links

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,450
back to this wiki page so people can get

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,480
a sense that that's this is what that

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,430
means and they also wanted to run chat

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,480
events which they began doing I don't

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,110
know how many they ran but they

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,390
certainly ran at least one which we're

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,830
about helping people learn more about

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,150
genome contribution and at least their

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,310
first one they had a pretty big

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,430
attendance pended twenty people as I

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,570
recall and when I say this it's not

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,400
because I was there it's cuz I read the

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,290
wiki pages and I read the history of

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,790
those wiki pages so you can all go do

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,489
this research yourself nothing special

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,959
here but the concerns that I have when I

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,480
think about this now eight years later

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,220
are first trying to figure out who is

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,040
the audience of genome love is that

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,130
people who are experienced C programmers

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,440
that they want to Shepherd into the

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,550
genome community in which case how are

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,140
they reaching those people are they

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:41,850
going to find going out to like top CS

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,160
universities and finding the ones that

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,170
teach C and then to email them all and

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,640
directing dozen to this page and the

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,140
other question I have well and the

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,700
answer is no as far as I know there was

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,470
no directed outreach as part of you know

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,180
I'm loved and the second question I have

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,250
is that I don't think that the genome

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,769
love crew can detect if their efforts

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,720
are really working they can see that

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,370
some bugs that are marking on love get

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,140
closed but they don't really know I

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,820
think if that's because of the wiki page

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,230
if that's because they were marking home

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,299
love at all I don't think they really

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,630
have a sense that if the people who are

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:15,690
new to those communities benefited from

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,880
the work they're doing so that was sort

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,410
of the first mentorship effort that I

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,640
learned about and I've been thinking a

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,270
lot more about mentorship over the past

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,919
four years the next major thing that

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,139
struck me when I heard about it and this

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,840
was in real-time is google Summer of

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:34,830
ah and my slide things are separated one

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,270
second you can't tell but my

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,499
presentation console isn't working okay

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,960
now you can tell great

00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:41,430
so yeah the point of you know google

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,169
Summer of Code in the beginning was to

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,360
bring new students into the free

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,430
software community and according to

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
Chris DiBona who originally managed the

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,879
program or manage the managers of the

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,389
program he thinks it's reasonably okay

00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:57,180
for attention the structure does anybody

00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,710
here does everybody in this any person

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,879
in this room not know the structural

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,139
details of google Summer of Code I know

00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:10,229
it's a bad question asker doesn't know

00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:12,150
okay great yeah yeah okay so briefly a

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,550
google Summer of Code is a paid

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,370
mentorship program between a free

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,139
software community like Debian and

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,969
university student where the University

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,710
student works for twelve weeks during

00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:24,509
the summer gets paid and have the

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,219
specific tasks they work on and have a

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:28,560
specific mentor that's assigned to them

00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:29,789
so it does me there's a strong

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,919
relationship between the mentor and the

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:33,800
mentee which is interesting and fairly

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,270
different from what kinome love does

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,370
it's also time limited to those 12 weeks

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,750
and goal oriented when you're doing

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,370
these things you really want to finish

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,979
the project that you set up set for

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,099
yourself at the beginning of the summer

00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:49,500
he's here some scoffs but some questions

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,300
I have about Summer of Code are how

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,009
resilient is it to student failure in

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,449
the sense that if a student doesn't

00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,159
manage to get all the work they wanted

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,919
to get done do they just feel so bad

00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:01,319
they want to vanish from the community

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,360
and does the mentor feel like they

00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,409
wasted all that time working on with

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,849
this one student I mean in a lot of

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:08,759
cases I would say yes they do feel that

00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,330
way and it's I also think that Google

00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,770
Summer of Code

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,589
isn't that resilient to mentor failure

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,180
which is a serious problem so if I as a

00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,830
G soft mentor this summer get really

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,000
busy or go Switzerland to go to a

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,339
conference and can't meant for my

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,050
student that well it would possibly

00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,029
happen if I didn't arrange for better

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:31,229
help that my student would just be like

00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:32,399
lost without me so the one one

00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:36,569
interesting thing about google Summer of

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:41,490
Code in 2005 and 2006 is the gender

00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:42,120
representation so good Nome in 2006 had

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,290
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,540
applicants through google Summer of Code

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,580
and I want to for those who know don't

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,230
raise your hands but a pop quiz of these

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:56,340
181 what percent do you think we're

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:59,669
women yeah of the 181 google Summer of

00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:06,120
Code applicants for genome in 2006 what

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:09,120
percentage of them were women so I hear

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,090
one is that a 2% yes I hear a 10% I hear

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,680
as se a zero coming from this side yeah

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:18,210
so it turns out the answer is strictly

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,540
zero ah and some good people in

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,680
particular Chris ball and Hannah Wallach

00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,300
who is also both of whom are also

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,300
slightly Debian people especially Hannah

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,930
wanted to do something about this so

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,419
they took google Summer of Code and they

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:37,169
inserted the word women into it and

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,400
otherwise changed nothing they they ran

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,380
the women's summer outreach program

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,910
which was a strict

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,940
you know tight mentor-mentee

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,200
relationship you work with the mentor to

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,090
figure out what your product will be you

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,050
get paid you work on it for 12 weeks the

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,729
funding happened to come from a

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,260
different source because they were had

00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:54,260
exceeded the google Summer of Code

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,000
deadline in order to get this bad data

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,350
and when they did that they got 100

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,020
applications for the women's summer

00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:07,740
outreach program yeah was it also

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,840
separate what was this Nome warmer

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,760
women's summer after each program also

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,220
separatist so that the applicants and

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,070
also the mentors were only women I think

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,280
the mentors could be men and women but

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:22,590
the applicants all had to be women yeah

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,940
this this is one of my favorite things

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,130
in free software mentorship history

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,979
because it just shows that if you do

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,450
anything - it shows to me that the big

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,669
missing question for how to find new

00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:35,550
people is the extent to which we

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,169
communicate in a diverse way with the

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,270
world I think a lot of the reason that

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,830
100 people signed up for this of whom

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,089
six great people were chosen is because

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,310
the word women is in the title it made

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,600
people who received this who are on free

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,640
software product mailing lists think oh

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,770
yeah I know what I could do to find more

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,850
women for the project and it's funny

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,140
because they could have thought that and

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,620
forwarded the google Summer of Code

00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,240
applique

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,120
information to their friends or whatever

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,300
to their like 500 friends of whom 100

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,380
applied but you often have to do

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,029
something to make people think about

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,620
doing outreach at all and by default

00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:12,410
because our mailing lists are where a

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,310
lot of our communication happen and

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,900
where a lot of these announcements get

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,640
posted and this mailing lists are

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,620
dominated largely by the kinds of people

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,990
who are already in free software

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,770
you see hilarious results like the 0%

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,240
applications women for genome so yeah to

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:34,440
me the key lesson here is that doing

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:36,420
outreach at all works great so the one

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,400
one question mark here for the women's

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,800
summer outreach program is that it

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,839
happened once in 2006 thanks to the

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,850
great effort of Hannah and Chris Paul

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,660
but it didn't really happen again until

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,610
2010 and that's because basically Hannah

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,740
and Chris didn't structure their

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,190
mentorship program to avoid themselves

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,720
burning out in 2007 or PC became a huge

00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,160
thing Chris ball became super busy

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,810
hannah was working on her dissertation

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,800
in linguistic and computers

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:06,839
computational linguistics so having an

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,190
exit plan for your mentorship system

00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,220
whatever that is for you the organizer

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,900
is really important but yeah so in 2010

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,810
marina is rockin skya revives this

00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,640
program before reviving the genome

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,839
outreach program from the woman's summer

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,330
outreach program but renaming it the

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,040
outreach program for women before doing

00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,959
that she just creates a list of mentors

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,910
in genome just wants a wiki page that

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,620
says who can be a mentor in genome and

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,660
from a conversation I had with her two

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,180
years ago the sense I got is that she

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,440
got for people to sign up for that list

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,720
of possible Mentors

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,270
but then once it was about a

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,570
time-limited program that she got 40 or

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:47,160
50 people to sign up for that so this

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,600
suggests to me that it's important to to

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,850
give mentor some sense that they're not

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,790
giving away their entire lives the yeah

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,770
so she managed to run it increasingly

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,320
frequently not just once during the

00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,880
summer 2006 but 2 to 3 times per year

00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,770
but she also makes sure there's a

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,480
one-month break between at least one

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,709
month break between those sessions so

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,270
that she has time to recover and the

00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,940
rest of her organizing team past

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,250
recover and another great thing about

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,070
the genome outreach program for women is

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,690
that it does not require the your

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,130
contributions to the project for which

00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,290
you're doing the paid internship again

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,600
it's a standard google Summer of Code

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,430
style type relationship between the

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,640
mentor and the mentee in the project but

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,560
because there are lots of people who do

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,300
want to show up in program where

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,800
possible the outreach program for women

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,040
directs them to apply to google Summer

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,920
of Code so then they use up their

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,390
limited opw resources on women who

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,160
couldn't even get funded by Summer of

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:48,780
Code because they're doing non code

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:51,750
things and the most recent the most

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:55,590
recent version had 37 people and it had

00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:58,140
naanum eight or so projects participated

00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,330
maybe more and seven of those people

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,370
were kernel developers all of whom

00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,230
landed their first patch in the kernel

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,520
in the first in the weeks and their

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,110
first couple weeks of their internship

00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:14,120
and that's thanks to the mentorship of

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:16,860
Sarah sharp and if you I'm just like

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,000
people can just show up out of nowhere

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,530
get mentored well show up because it's a

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,790
great outreach program that causes them

00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,780
to even hear about that free software

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,440
community and believe they can

00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:29,910
participate and then they get patches

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,320
landed in the kernel I don't have that I

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,210
should sign up for these programs maybe

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,960
except I can't but that's fine because I

00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:38,940
actually can manage myself just fine

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,710
yeah so basically if you had this kind

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,780
of directed mentorship it really works

00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,430
and so for me one of the lessons from

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,350
the outreach program for women is that

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,690
if a goal is to increase participation

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,910
by women in whichever free software

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,410
projects we're talking about we all all

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,660
of our products have limited mentor

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,790
resources we can just focus a large

00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,140
fraction those mentor resources on a sub

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,710
problem of our projects that we care a

00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:04,110
lot about a one thing is I don't know if

00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,850
these are resilient to you the mentor is

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,780
flaking out just like google Summer of

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:13,830
Code but that's life so I'd heard about

00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:16,260
all this and I went to Def Con in 2010

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,300
and organized birds of a feather called

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,620
Debian for shy people and it was one of

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,450
the most fun experiences of my life we

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,580
had this room like this but packed with

00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:28,080
people who were all like wow

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:30,110
yeah we don't like talking to people and

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,390
are afraid of them

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,490
just like me so that wasn't super

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,950
inspiring experience so I thought okay

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,450
maybe I can try to apply this to the

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:44,310
Debian mentors mailing list because

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:45,870
often people should I'm sorry often in

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,880
my experience on Debian mentors people

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,230
ask a question and then maybe don't know

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,000
if I'll get an answer don't get an

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,970
answer and if you subscribe to the

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,560
mailing list you just lurk you think who

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,300
even knows if my questions are going to

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,500
get answered what's the point this is so

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,570
sad and distant and so what I wanted to

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,160
do was set the community to have a goal

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,950
of responding to those questions within

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,900
four days even if all the response

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,220
should be as simple as sorry no one

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,340
answer your question we're all very busy

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,380
but I hope somebody answers soon that

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,870
would be a lot more reassuring than

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,890
radio silence and moreover seeing other

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,460
people who you don't even know

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:26,580
experienced radio silence so what I

00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,560
learned from that is that I didn't have

00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:34,770
the bandwidth to succeed at that by

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:36,180
myself and I set this goal and couldn't

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,650
make it work and so actually we saw a

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,090
great increase in Debian mentor's

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,940
traffic when I declared we would all do

00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,450
this and then tapered off when we didn't

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:50,220
succeed at doing it the other thing is

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:52,740
midway into this period we I was like

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,580
okay now that I created this promise I'd

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,670
like to find out if we're actually

00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,050
succeeding at it and then I like spent a

00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,850
bunch of time riding me mailing lists

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,280
scraping code that was more complicated

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,920
I expected could that software and I

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,540
should have done that first if I had

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,680
some goals that were measurable

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,800
I should have set up my measurements

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,060
first it would have saved it would have

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,380
made this lot better we could have had a

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,390
little dashboard and that other people

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,010
could be like oh man meantime response

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:21,300
to six days I could respond faster so

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,710
with that failure under my belt I

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,190
thought I know I'll do something totally

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,440
different

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,300
I'll run how to get involved in

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,710
open-source workshop at a college new

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,910
where I was living at the time at the

00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:33,840
University of Pennsylvania in

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:35,820
Philadelphia and the idea of this was to

00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,930
have a day of lectures where we taught

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,760
people how to get involved

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:41,640
how bug trackers work how version

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,500
control works how communities and

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,560
conversations work what flows free

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:51,000
software licensing is and there is kind

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,710
of a very welcoming approach to general

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,120
free software mentorship and I had a

00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,190
personal goal that I wanted to have a

00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,690
pretty diverse attendee base so I

00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,190
thought okay I might have to go work

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,920
with women in computer science groups

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,899
etc what I found though was that by

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,970
doing nothing but writing a very

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,529
welcoming invitation to walk to the

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,390
event and sending it to the computer

00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:11,120
science mailing list 30% of my

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:14,940
applicants for the event were women and

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,740
we ended up being over full so we sort

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,740
of sorted the applicants by how excited

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,110
they were and the top 30 you know women

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,149
seem to be equally likely to be super

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:27,540
excited as men so 30% of our actual

00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,860
attendees were women and we managed to

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,370
do that without any gender specific

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,740
outreach because I think the text was

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,750
written in a very welcoming way and

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,880
because we sent it to the most diverse

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,070
possible computer science mailing list

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,390
we had at Penn by contrast if I had sent

00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,130
it to the computer club at Penn the

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,170
dining philosophers the dining

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,810
philosophers is almost entirely dudes so

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,790
if I then did that I wouldn't be

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,260
surprised to find if no women signed up

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:57,500
because I didn't tell any women about it

00:16:52,260 --> 00:17:00,540
so yeah we did general outreach there

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,920
and that was a lot of fun but I didn't

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,410
do a great job of capturing their

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,760
enthusiasm and helping them stay active

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,740
in the free software projects that they

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,520
want to submit patches to in the second

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,689
day of the workshop so okay more

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,990
failures by sheesh but I'm slowly

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:18,720
learning here and around the same year I

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,220
saw something really exciting which I

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,089
don't have much here in slides so I'll

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:27,059
just tell you the the Fedora design team

00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:29,130
in 2009 and 2010 set up what they call

00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,540
design bounties and these bounties are

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,330
different than standard code bounties

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,460
for money they they operate in the

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,770
following way there's one person in the

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,260
project who says we really need this

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,820
task done so we really need a t-shirt

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,970
design for our students who worked on

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:47,220
Fedora over the summer and she writes a

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,110
blog post that says here's why this is

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,370
here's what the task is here's why it is

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,350
so important

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,240
I'm running about this on my blog which

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,800
means that it's super easy to read and

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,720
it's not like you have to be part of any

00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,300
existing community like if it were on a

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,040
mailing list basically and I will offer

00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,440
you mentorship if you want to do this

00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,630
and the prize for succeeding is not

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,250
money it's instead you get commit access

00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,110
to the fedora design subversion

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,780
repository and you are part of our team

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:19,830
so the prize is the capacity to do more

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:21,120
work and I like but I think it's also

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,740
I'd like to say the prize is sort of

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,030
love like you get inclusion in the

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,070
community you know that if you do this

00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,460
you're part of the Fedora design team

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,559
and you're part of something bigger and

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,929
she also says in the blog post leave a

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,929
comment to lock this and then you get 48

00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:38,250
hours to attempt it and then I'll review

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:40,130
your work and offer to mentor you and

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,200
help make your work the best it could be

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,630
if we accept your work great otherwise

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,710
the task is sort of unlocked and it goes

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,559
the next person who'll have to comment

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:52,530
and what they found was they did this

00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,270
three or four times and got a reliable

00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,160
reliably they got somebody new to the

00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,250
community to show up many of whom have

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,420
stuck around since and I I've been

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,220
trying to clone this another free

00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,860
software project I did it twice in 2010

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,990
once for the open hatch website code in

00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,190
Django and once for the students for

00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,650
free culture Asit and system

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,910
administration team and in both cases we

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,040
found a young woman who was already on

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,780
our mailing list who really wanted to

00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,980
get more involved and really wanted to

00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,170
be mentored on this to be part of that

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,760
community and both of those people are

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,420
still active in communities that I'm a

00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,940
part of now so I think that this model

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,429
of is singular tasks really works and

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:33,750
it's a very different model then the

00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:36,990
kinome love model of doing a lot of work

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,580
to analyze a lot of bugs and list them

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,830
and hope people find the page at all

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,050
it's really publicity oriented first and

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:47,580
it's one-on-one mentorship but also it's

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:51,090
time limited if you know there's no

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,950
obligation for Maureen Duffy who was the

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,530
main mentor for these to continue to

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:59,520
mentor this new person past the first 22

00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:01,350
days of that period it is however a lot

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,690
of work still you do it feel like write

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,290
up all the skills you'll need to do it

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,420
our

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:10,380
snobs people that have the skills linked

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:13,710
to like resources on those but I think

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:16,440
it's a really good example so on

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:18,000
Wikipedia they created an effort called

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,400
the tea house where they want to welcome

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,590
new people into Wikipedia by creating a

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,900
social cafe like space that might help

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:27,330
support more new editors on the wiki and

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,350
this is because in 2012 and for these

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,260
some of the years before that the

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:33,930
Wikimedia Foundation was wasn't kind of

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,550
remains terrified of the number of

00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,250
editors to Wikipedia declining over time

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,680
and also they're unhappy with the

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,750
relatively low gender diversity of the

00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,950
Wikipedia editor community although if

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,780
you talk to me after this I think

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,400
basically they're also really bad at

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,170
statistics and do really low-quality

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:54,320
surveys I have a different talk about

00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:57,320
that but but this effort the tea house

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,520
addresses a real problem which is

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:03,720
getting more editors to be more active

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,250
and their strategy was to ping new

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,900
editors on the wiki by sending them a

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,850
personal message to their user account

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,650
saying hey you new here do you want to

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,390
come to our social cafe like space where

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:16,200
people can friend Lily

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:18,300
ask and answer questions and so they

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,860
have this like message board on a wiki

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,900
basically but they have a little bit of

00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,990
UI that makes it more friendly and a lot

00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,310
of contextual information that really

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,550
tries to convince you this is going to

00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:32,250
be a friendly place and that's really

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,630
most of the project I think and yeah so

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,490
it's many to many it doesn't require

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,490
this one-on-one mentor relationship like

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,280
google Summer of Code or the federal

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,960
design bounties and on the front page to

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,150
the tea house effort they show a sample

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,320
question that has been answered so that

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,050
people can get a sense that yeah

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,000
questions do really get answered here

00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,530
and I kind of wonder if we just replaced

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,450
the front page of Debian mentors like

00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,730
the list archive page with one sample

00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,500
question that got answered maybe more

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,560
people would be less afraid of that

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,820
mailing list although maybe they'd be

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,820
wrong they should be afraid of it and so

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,930
maybe we should actually fix it but but

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,250
one of the things that they set up

00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:13,850
properly is that they had some goals and

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:16,050
they set up their measurements before

00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:18,610
organizing this outreach effort so they

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:20,260
wanted to measure how many people are

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,150
in the tea house how many questions get

00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,760
answered and they define answer is just

00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:27,280
anybody of replying to the message and

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,700
how long that takes so what they found

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,350
was that people who use the tea house

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,090
who are new editors compared to the

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,580
people who don't use the tea house they

00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,860
edit 10 times as many articles across

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,860
that's within Wikipedia and they make

00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:45,010
seven times more edits across all of the

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,020
wikimedia properties and this is the

00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:51,220
most exciting one i think twice as much

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:53,610
of their content is not reverted which

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:57,820
is quite an achievement as jimmy i guess

00:22:53,610 --> 00:23:01,179
and they they have about 40 users per

00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:06,880
week asking and asking questions who are

00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:08,650
new users and of the people who are on

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,030
the tea house according to their surveys

00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,250
which have some bias problems but

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,140
leaving that aside it seems that about

00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:17,140
three times as many more of them are

00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,870
women then in the control group mmm so

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,850
perhaps this suggests that the newest

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,890
editors who are at least like existing

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,929
editors benefit a lot from having this

00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,660
kind of conversational space which in a

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:29,890
way makes plenty of sense the people who

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,760
don't need this conversational space

00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,990
will do fine without it

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,760
having said that it's three times the

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,340
three times as many women compared to

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,809
the baseline population it's still

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,130
majority men participating in ants

00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:45,460
asking and answering questions on the

00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:47,799
tea house and one thing that they do

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,130
that debian doesn't really do is that

00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:53,650
they on the tea house there's a section

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,210
where you are encouraged to write a

00:23:53,650 --> 00:24:00,630
little bit about yourself put your photo

00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:03,160
on a page and one of those users mmm is

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,690
selected to be shown on the front page

00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,520
of the tea house plus one of the people

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:11,049
who is answering questions so they asked

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,280
participants in the tea house doesn't

00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,169
matter that we asked you to write about

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,450
who you are what you want to get out of

00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:17,860
your experience at Wikipedia and the

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,010
fact that you put a photo there and

00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,120
basically people say yes it's not only

00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,770
nice to write about what I want to get

00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,480
out of my experience at Wikipedia it's

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,530
also really nice to see what other

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,750
people want to get out of their

00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:32,020
experience at Wikipedia editing

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,700
contributing so that's

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,580
sort of aggregated a kind of concept

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,500
inventory in a loose sense of ways to

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,510
categorize and understand mentorship

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,550
programs the first one is the question

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,470
of who gets who is part of the

00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:49,930
mentorship program so we've gone on blob

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:51,190
it's a very open almost dangerously open

00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:54,370
in the sense you've no idea who's using

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,410
it system other mentorship programs are

00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,880
more closed like Google Summer of Code

00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,900
where you have to be selected and the

00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,450
tea house is somewhere in the middle

00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,160
where it's open to anyone but the people

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,750
running it do send invitations and the

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,640
people who receive invitations are more

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,180
likely to actually participate by some

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:14,670
huge factor one question for me about

00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:16,600
mentorship programs is about if they if

00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,190
when you participate in the mentorship

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,080
program do you end up with a new human

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,850
connection to somebody so in genome love

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,020
if you go and click around on bugs you

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,120
don't really end up with the new human

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,850
connection but on the tea house somebody

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,810
answers your question within an hour and

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,400
you see their username when you click

00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,840
around and you maybe while waiting click

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,300
around the social profiles you're like

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,160
oh and by social profiles I mean there's

00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,130
a wiki page with standard wiki ugly

00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,050
image and like paragraph next to it with

00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,850
weird alignment so we're not talking

00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:46,300
about like eye framing Facebook or

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:49,620
something here but even that does a

00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,620
great job of building Keamy connections

00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,880
the tea house is interesting in that it

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,040
is hopefully resilient to mentor-mentee

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,480
failure and you can see that in part

00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,250
because people sort of wander in and out

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,770
of who answers questions people have

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,170
different degrees of activity over time

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,640
and that works out really well because

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,560
they somehow set up a structure where

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,340
people feel willing to answer a question

00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,570
or two and then wander off I think one

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,940
of the big questions for me about

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:19,060
mentorship projects is sort of why

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,520
bother which is to say can we identify

00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,720
the people or the groups of people who

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,100
are benefiting from this mentorship

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:30,130
program so in the case of the tea house

00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,840
the goal is to make Wikipedia editor

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,210
community more vibrant and more gender

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,410
diverse and so hopefully the readers the

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:39,670
encyclopedia benefit the other authors

00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,750
on the encyclopedia benefit to the

00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,100
individual authors who are getting

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,720
mentored benefit the people answering

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,680
questions hopefully benefit because

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,630
they're having some fun answering

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,790
questions

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,320
um we're the genome lab there's

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,090
definitely some thought into whose life

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,460
it's supposed to improve users of genome

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,320
and other developers on the genome

00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,480
projects that we're inviting they're

00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,400
inviting people to but I think that

00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,200
basically we did he house they put in a

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,690
lot more thought into thinking about

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,490
which people are affected by the program

00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,960
and trying to make sure was a good

00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,780
experience for them so by contrast with

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,240
Google Summer of Code you know I think

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,880
is a bath later today I was hearing some

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,140
grumblings that maybe there is okay

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,750
there's off on the google Summer of Code

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,310
tomorrow and there's some grumblings in

00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,960
among many products at participating

00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,700
google Summer of Code that the students

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,900
get a lot out of it the mentors maybe

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,360
get something out of it although they

00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,000
lose a lot of time and the project maybe

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,160
maybe maybe get something out of it and

00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,540
if you sort of show up if you sort of

00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,280
show up to a mentorship program without

00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,990
thinking clearly about what you want to

00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,310
get out of it and how you'll know if

00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:42,780
you're getting that out of it you're

00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:44,400
unlikely to get as much out of it which

00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,990
brings me to actually measuring the

00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,660
results you're getting out of it so I

00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:53,190
don't think that in Debian for gee sock

00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:54,960
we measure we go and look and see which

00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,330
key saw projects actually succeeded in

00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,290
which contributors stay around maybe we

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,610
just in an ad hoc way yeah if one of the

00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,670
goals is to create is to create new

00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,360
contributors informally we do that

00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:08,400
difficult of the goal is to create more

00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,850
contributors then it seems wise to ask

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,280
the question you know is the children

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:18,150
learning are the people actually stick

00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:22,440
around sitting around and interestingly

00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:23,820
the tea house is goal oriented it helps

00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,320
people answer questions about

00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,200
encyclopedia articles are trying to

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:35,100
write some mentorship programs aren't

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:37,770
really goal oriented so I mean I guess I

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,780
kind of like the Debian mentorship

00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,550
mailing list is some combination of

00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:45,030
supposed to help you get review on your

00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:48,870
packages just for you to like hang out

00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:51,720
and find out more about Debian it's also

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,770
definitely not time limited whereas some

00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,310
of these programs are talked about are

00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:58,860
and there's a classification about is it

00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,310
sort of one mentee too many mentors is

00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,220
it

00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:04,170
one mentor to one mentee is it I you

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,530
know many de many the tea houses many

00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:09,000
too many things like the Damien women

00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:11,190
mentoring program from three years ago

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,620
and I guess that continues is sort of

00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,540
many to one where there's like four ish

00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:21,780
mentees for one mentor is that about

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:29,840
right initially the mentoring program

00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:32,310
it's one-to-one usually okay yeah and

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,920
there's one other question here which I

00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:37,170
fail to right which is to what extent is

00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,880
that mentorship visible which kind of

00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,920
relates back to the resilience to mentor

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,690
mentee failure so on the tea house if

00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,830
somebody's question isn't being answered

00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:48,120
any other answer can go and click and

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,550
answer whereas if you do private

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,200
mentorship then other people in the

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,470
community you can't tell if people are

00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,580
succeeding at the mentorship goals and

00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,800
sometimes that's okay but it's just

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,270
important to know to consider the

00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:05,760
publicness with regards to the

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:08,010
resilience to the failure so I have

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,510
about 15 minutes left and I guess I want

00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,130
to cover a couple of other mentorship

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,330
efforts but I'll try to do so briefly so

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,190
we can have some conversation time at

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,200
the end

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:20,640
the first is easy hacks by Libre Office

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,380
and in a nutshell this is a combination

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,440
of a keyword on the bug tracker like a

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,890
gnome for what makes a good easy task

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,600
but also about 16 other keywords for how

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,580
hard the task is what kind of skills it

00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,130
requires and a collection of wiki pages

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:38,550
on libre offices website that tell you

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:40,530
that let you browse these from the wiki

00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:42,000
rather than from the bug tracker so you

00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:44,580
don't have to learn Bugzilla first you

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,780
can read wiki text and we will read up

00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,730
rendered wiki text and they found that

00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,950
it's super helpful to have a hand

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,570
curated list of what these easy tasks

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,490
are and to write a bit about how you

00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:03,300
would go solve them rather than just tag

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:04,680
the bugs so I mentioned that at the open

00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,730
source comes to campus event that I ran

00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,240
three years ago and that I've been

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:12,480
running a bunch lately still we sort of

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,030
asked new contributors to find a task in

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,410
they want to work on and then mentor

00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,660
them during the day but then afterward

00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,309
have no follow-up no really strong

00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,179
follow-up plan we sort of say you can

00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:22,620
email us if you want

00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,169
and nearly nobody does and I wish they

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,059
would by contrast upstream University

00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:29,190
runs a very similar program of you know

00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:31,230
teaching skills and then getting people

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,760
to decide what free software project bug

00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,429
they want to solve but what they also do

00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:38,250
is say now that you've been here for

00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:40,679
these two days every time you do eight

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,140
hours of work personally on this tour

00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,970
this bug you should ping us and we'll

00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,210
schedule a one-hour IRC chat with you

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,760
and your upstream University mentor and

00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:52,350
we'll go and read what you've done and

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,600
tell you how if we think you can improve

00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:58,320
your contribution so then they sort of

00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,000
serve as side input for patch review and

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,510
helping you communicate better with the

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,410
project some of you may know the phrase

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:09,840
well anyway never mind the idea though

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,549
is that you will continue to be mentored

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,860
until your contribution sticks to the

00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:15,929
project and that's been very successful

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,960
for them although with with one or two

00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:20,090
exceptions but basically many many of

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,470
the people who show up to those programs

00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,480
really want to put in the work it's just

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,850
a matter of making sure they have an

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,190
expectation for the mentor that the

00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:33,600
mentor will be there for them and that

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:35,040
then works out the favorite thing that

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,110
I've talked to a handful of you about in

00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,960
person and said obscure email to various

00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,340
Debian mailing list about is the I've

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,169
been to developer advisory team so let

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,520
me clarify that here and then talk about

00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:48,690
how I think I want to port that to

00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:50,220
Debian so I went to has this semi secret

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,490
team called the developer advisory team

00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,549
on their wiki page and they talked about

00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,210
their goals as greeting new contributors

00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:59,299
encouraging people to apply for

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:02,040
developer status in the project and

00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:03,710
contacting people who have been lost to

00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,610
some house uploaded a bunch of work

00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,880
packages got sponsors but then they

00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:10,740
wandered off and I seen this wiki page

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,350
and I see those edited a year and a half

00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,570
ago almost and I say oh okay this is

00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,340
like those blogs where people say oh man

00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,290
blogging is so much fun I'm gonna blog

00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:23,400
more and that's the most recent post

00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,870
it's from like 2010 so that's that was

00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,340
my impression of the developer advisory

00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,350
team I had sort of written them off

00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:31,590
because everyone's always like oh yeah

00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:33,180
we need to mentor more and but it turns

00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,070
out that they are pretty active they

00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,810
just don't talk about it in public in

00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,790
public they talk a little bit about this

00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,770
survey they send new contributors

00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:43,430
I'll gloss over some of this it's in the

00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:45,210
slides I guess we'll put them online

00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:47,250
they do send us riveting new

00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:52,290
contributors but the really cool thing

00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:54,240
that they do is they secretly they track

00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,140
new bo2 contributors with the tool that

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,580
they try not to tell anyone about

00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:00,270
because they're embarrassed that people

00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:02,130
are being tracked by them ah and do that

00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,720
they use a table in the ultimate Debian

00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,610
database we've been to upload history

00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,640
and they just search for people whose

00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:10,890
uploads are have been who do their first

00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,410
upload in the past three months and they

00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:16,020
show those people on a list ah and the

00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:17,880
idea of this list is if you are part of

00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,710
the developer advisory team your mission

00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,290
is to go say hello to one of those

00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:23,940
people send them a greeting email and be

00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:27,210
there a welcoming point to the project

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,350
and then you say that you did so you

00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,400
click a button then they get removed

00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,890
from that list and you have more people

00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,120
to go greet if you want to or if not

00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:36,870
they may be able to certain to become or

00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:42,180
when you visit the page again so I think

00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:44,610
that yeah I think that we should clone

00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,960
this we should query the upload history

00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:49,530
table not the bin to upload history

00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:52,020
table and reached out to debian

00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,370
contributors who are new and not

00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,620
necessarily created this really tight

00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,730
mentor-mentee relationship not

00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,300
necessarily do anything goal-oriented

00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,470
with this yet but just welcome people

00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,000
and we can extend that beyond people

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:06,660
who've gotten their packages sponsored

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,120
by either extracting more information or

00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,660
Korean EDD and lahrman and I will maybe

00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:17,940
hack on that later today

00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:21,150
so this yeah yeah about this I think we

00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:24,750
looking at iPod history is a bit looking

00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:31,230
too late in the process I agree with

00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:33,090
that better to look at a GPS or yeah

00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,400
totally

00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,870
we get so the authority with this is

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,400
that I open hatch how the google Summer

00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,500
of Code student because we're interested

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,440
in taking the winter code making a

00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,090
generic having me plus a Debian

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,530
welcoming team all the way up to figure

00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,210
out what the name of it is David for

00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,670
Debian and then make it useful for a

00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:54,090
variety of products also so in addition

00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,710
to upload history being too late I like

00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,850
the idea of including bugs we should

00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,010
basically make sure that the source

00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:01,770
state is broad in scope to include non

00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,510
packaging contributors for example it

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,090
might include people who have posted a

00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:09,240
mail or two or three on a developer

00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:14,700
focused mailing list or or translation

00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,840
commits or or significant answering of

00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,030
questions I'm not sure how this would be

00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:22,050
tracked in US without natural language

00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:24,570
processing in IRC or you know or showing

00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:27,870
up at Def Con not having done anything

00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,820
before yeah totally interested it's just

00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:33,540
a matter of writing the code to pull in

00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:37,920
identity as from those sources yeah I I

00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:39,450
did this it's on the video yeah I just

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,860
want to say there's might be quite a lot

00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,240
of overlap with Enrico's them yeah

00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,350
contributor stuff here so it's finding

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,190
on tracking basically everything

00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:52,760
everyone does with him yesterday about

00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:56,250
that did you

00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,080
one of the things that well we get

00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:01,860
complaints every now and then different

00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:04,260
projects is the interface that people

00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:07,140
for example in Debian find mailing lists

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,160
and stuff very intimidating would it be

00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:13,050
a possibility to also offer some kind of

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,490
initial contacts issue easier way I'd

00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:19,740
know exactly what use I don't like

00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:20,610
forums but it's been well if I

00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,590
understand correctly you're saying

00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:24,360
someday being contributors find mailing

00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:28,020
lists interface overwhelming or

00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:30,600
intimidating maybe a newcomer didn't

00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:34,740
wanna be contributors at least yeah and

00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:37,470
I mean I certainly felt that way it's

00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,880
why I like hung out on Debian very

00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,990
steady mailing list for years before

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,910
trying to do anything useful for the

00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:46,440
project and I mean I think part of that

00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,920
maybe can be addressed by having a

00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,349
contact

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,440
person who introduces you to the project

00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:53,730
so you can then if this mentee can just

00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,119
email the person who greeted them and

00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,030
say

00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,619
so these mailing lists should I really

00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,880
join them forever they talk on them and

00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:01,829
you'll say yes yes yes and they'll

00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:08,940
finally get it oh boy

00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:21,000
but fixing just is that enough to answer

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:25,500
your question try to approach that in

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,240
and my my idea was is this sort of

00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,200
taking into account I mean what's your

00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,609
suggestion regarding this apart from the

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,819
initial human contact like for example

00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:38,220
someone wants to get I mean many of the

00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:40,920
Debian contributors or the president

00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:44,069
stuff came to Debian by knowing already

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,809
some yeah money Debian but imagine that

00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:48,119
someone and that's the case or some

00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:50,490
other people just want to try to

00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,950
something they got indicated to develop

00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:55,410
a to get interview the work having paid

00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:58,740
the knew they were mentor spaces and

00:38:55,410 --> 00:39:01,920
stuff and that some of those people are

00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:03,420
like they pull away because they did not

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,040
comfortable with the interface that's

00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:13,500
the one embrace that maybe you want to

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:15,480
maybe doing better or not I don't know I

00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,099
mean I guess I think a few things about

00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,650
that one is that it's a real problem and

00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:21,930
that the Wikipedia tea house in the if

00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,930
you read the report about their first

00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:28,020
six months they part of the feedback

00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:30,390
they got was one experienced Wikipedia

00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:33,089
contributor said I was really concerned

00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,799
and honestly unhappy that you guys want

00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:37,589
to change the interface to make it more

00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:39,960
friendly for newcomers and then when I

00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:41,700
but I didn't complain then and then I

00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,829
participated in the system and I was

00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,270
like oh wow this interfaces makes me

00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:47,040
feel totally more welcomed and it's much

00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:50,490
more inviting and it's still like an

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,530
ugly MediaWiki site but there's a bunch

00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:54,089
more chrome around it and like you to go

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:58,910
through slightly fewer actions to party

00:39:54,089 --> 00:39:58,910
people so

00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,130
is it really it's a real problem and it

00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,779
really ought to be fixed

00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,369
the other thing I want to say is I'm

00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:06,450
unlikely to be a person involved in

00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,720
fixing that in the next six to twelve

00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:13,200
months

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:15,950
I hope that other people are but so I'll

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,910
do this thing first and then I'll see

00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:23,130
but the other I mean a problems with the

00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:26,999
Debian mailing lists can likely be fixed

00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:30,390
by writing a different archiving skin so

00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:37,170
and actually the Fedora project has been

00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:39,690
working on an archiver called hyper

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:44,430
kitty of like kitty mail no hyper kitty

00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:47,640
like hype like piper mail but not piper

00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:49,710
anyway and it sort of puts people first

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,059
and use the gravitas to show images of

00:40:49,710 --> 00:41:00,210
people's heads or whatever they you'd

00:40:51,059 --> 00:41:03,299
make their Gravatar yeah yeah it also

00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:05,460
allows you to reply in line of via a web

00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:09,119
interface so it doesn't need you to use

00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:12,630
email which is maybe how to start

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,400
contributing so maybe the right answer

00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,499
is who in this room is interested in

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:23,670
spending two hours today trying to set

00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:26,910
up hyper kitty right okay cool I'll find

00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:30,089
you guys ever yeah I'm I am not really

00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:32,849
sure if it's really the interface only

00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:35,729
which is the problem I guess it's the

00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:38,969
environment and the contact with the

00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:41,849
people and for outsiders finding out but

00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:44,519
is the job they can do and but they can

00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:46,829
be involved it but but there they can be

00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,989
successful and things like that this is

00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:51,479
also a good approach and maybe a step in

00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:54,210
that direction making the interface is a

00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:58,380
bit shinier or things like that but

00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:00,420
maybe not the core problem yeah well I

00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,789
think it's they should just fix all the

00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,350
problems at once I can reply to that I'm

00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:09,730
a Debian developer now

00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:11,860
yeah I've been connected to the Debian

00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,570
project for a long time like I don't

00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,700
know been using that beam for 10 years

00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:20,380
started contributing through google

00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:23,860
Summer of Code in 2007 and I had a

00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,690
really hard time to like figure out what

00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,760
can I contribute with I'm a developer

00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:30,940
I'm a programmer so I wanted to develop

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,280
and package or whatever and like oh I'll

00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,970
take some orphan package that I don't

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,920
use and don't have any use in for so why

00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,210
should I package that so I didn't

00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,580
because it doesn't make sense

00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:45,430
but it would be really nice and we

00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:48,550
talked about this on the welcome to Def

00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:52,270
Con session with Enrico like at the

00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:55,570
start and that's an issue for probably a

00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,860
lot of people so I don't have any

00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,260
solution but it would be nice to like

00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:02,020
have a like I don't know welcoming page

00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:06,880
that's not developers corner that's more

00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:08,290
like EC right yeah and I think one of

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,060
the things that seemed clear to me about

00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:13,810
gonna love is that it takes the approach

00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:15,700
of tagging and then forgetting and I

00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:17,710
don't like that as much as the Libre

00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,900
Office easy hacks approach of if you're

00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:22,390
going to tag bugs with their easiness

00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,860
it's worth spending five times as much

00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,860
time also writing how to fix them

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,460
apparently I have one minute left so

00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:35,250
everyone should ask a question at once I

00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:38,290
I agree with the last statement that if

00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:40,720
someone is not an insider kind of in

00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:43,810
Debian it's really really hard to get

00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,870
involved it's it's I guess in my

00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:49,360
experience it's very hard to get

00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:51,910
involved you look at the page you think

00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:54,280
you can contribute there and you just

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:57,790
realize it's just much more complicated

00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,530
that I think pinged off so unresponsive

00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:01,030
sitting but I want to quickly say two

00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:03,820
things first there's a Debian mentors

00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:07,000
bought tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. and

00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,910
secondly I have a question for all of

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,030
you who in the room is interested in

00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,130
periodically

00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:16,330
maybe sending emails to new contributors

00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:18,450
who we've detected are and now becoming

00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,890
to be active in the project okay who

00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,750
else in the room can take a picture if

00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,940
you wall or write down your Knicks Jimmy

00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:26,099
wait everyone put your hands up again

00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,570
like that and then Jimmy and now let's

00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:31,130
say your names in order you owe and of

00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:31,130
you but say them so we can write down

00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:47,820
yet again Auggie yeah Serafim who else

00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:50,490
without a hand okay / if you're

00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,980
interested in periodically sending

00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:57,720
emails to new contributors to greet them

00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:59,700
in Debian raise your hand and oh yeah

00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:07,770
and or put your nametag up yeah thank

00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:08,849
you yeah oh yeah this video right okay

00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:11,220
Oh

00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:14,760
we'll just like pressing space on the

00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:17,700
recording okay I just have another

00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,160
comment how you could try to involve

00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:23,130
people we are doing in davie amid

00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:26,190
sprints and 2011 it's not only Debian

00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:28,740
developer bus users and we have in my

00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:32,940
talk on Monday I have a serious proof

00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:35,730
that is increased all me a matrix with

00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,890
it of new developer so if you find some

00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:40,619
groups on team meeting just in both our

00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:43,109
people invite them and maybe it tells

00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:47,970
you more about in my talk this afternoon

00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:50,119
can I give you a high-five okay good

00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:53,369
enough for me okay

00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:55,079
yeah users are great user testing is

00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:57,869
something we don't do very much which is

00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,910
to ask people to try to achieve tasks

00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:01,310
with Debian and then watch them fail and

00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:07,290
then fix the things that made them fail

00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:09,960
so we should do that more yeah I haven't

00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:12,630
been I've been since 2010 was the last

00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,700
time I was really I've got a kid in

00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,010
between now and then so I've been busy

00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:22,069
with real life but the an idea I had

00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:25,530
then is to have like a 1 week or so IRC

00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:28,680
IRC mentorship with packaging or

00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:29,670
whatever and has has there been any such

00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,680
effort I've missed that

00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,280
yeah periodically do you want to talk

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,890
about that

00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,750
I think time is up so I mean you're all

00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:39,270
welcome to continue the discussion

00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,440
around it's lunchtime now right oh yeah

00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:42,390
15 minutes until lunch

00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,690
so exactly we have lots of time over

00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:47,220
lunch to talk so please thank you -

00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:56,370
Ashish for his presentation and

00:46:47,220 --> 00:47:03,450
everybody for the contribution yeah okay

00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:04,980
yeah I just wanted to say that that we

00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:08,670
already tried that in in different

00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:11,040
projects in Debian and IRC tutorials and

00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:13,070
not enough they don't they don't really

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,600
serve us as tutorial they might be

00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:18,510
complementing in regarding you can do

00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,940
people with particular questions not as

00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:22,740
good questions that you would do in them

00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,320
in the mailing list but it's not enough

00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:28,110
and so I think we should we should maybe

00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,930
rethink especially regarding new

00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:34,380
generations whether we should change our

00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:37,230
our tutorial ways maybe even doing some

00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:40,320
some video casts or some something like

00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:43,920
that which is more I have ideas to make

00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,300
IRC tutorial pop yeah which is basically

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,830
to make sure that you the information

00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,660
about them gets out to people who really

00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:50,250
care about them so to make sure that

00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,020
they're part of the welcoming message if

00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:53,790
there's no tutorial coming up and to

00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,830
capture contact information for people

00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,910
when they come to IRC tutorials so we

00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:59,520
can then follow up with them and

00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:02,660
Shepherd them into the project yeah this

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,640
was sort of my idea since I do a lot of

00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:07,160
well everything is real life even the

00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,619
internet but face-to-face meetings where

00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,720
I do packaging tutorials so this was

00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:15,559
like one way to do it on the internet

00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:17,660
but videocast is super you know what I

00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:20,779
mean is that I've been doing for the

00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:22,279
last - receiving a student for last year

00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:25,099
some of the course or some of the course

00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:26,539
of Coursera and some of these nice

00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:29,930
things that some universities are doing

00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:31,849
and they don't seem that hard to do in

00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:34,789
the or technical way and maybe that

00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:36,979
could be an easy way to get people at

00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:40,609
least to make people learn or to it's

00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:45,349
the entry point probably not I mean

00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:47,390
probably is not the best way to to teach

00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:50,269
I guess one question I have is how would

00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:51,920
we reach how it once we've created the

00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:53,450
content how will we find people and

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,400
cause them to read the content or watch

00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:58,640
the content it look like per has an

00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,979
answer okay so I know a lot of people

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,599
that I I'm totally fine with reading

00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,999
text myself I love just digging into

00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:08,599
really fat thick text document and I'm

00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:10,160
not scared about it but I was once but

00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:12,440
then there's people with dyslexia there

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,749
are really super talented people and if

00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,339
they get a video they're like they have

00:49:14,749 --> 00:49:19,150
the greatest time of their life it's

00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:21,680
like okay I can't read a manual page but

00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:25,219
watching someone do what I want on a

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:29,119
video cast is like good so I think I

00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:30,469
think videos is super so I have a

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,499
question who wants to take a look at

00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:36,710
this packaging tutorial PDF slides and

00:49:33,499 --> 00:49:37,819
make them into a video today or if you

00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,950
don't make them into a video make them

00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:41,599
into an ASCII screencast three people

00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:45,289
can watch the terminal stuff these are

00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:47,630
awesome if you haven't I guess there

00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:50,869
will be a presentation or a talk today

00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:53,390
or or maybe tomorrow tomorrow about this

00:49:50,869 --> 00:50:00,619
yeah what is that talk tomorrow

00:49:53,390 --> 00:50:02,719
I don't know talk to instance that in

00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:04,969
the packaging toy over four or five

00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:07,160
different practical sessions and this

00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:09,990
would be really good targets for ASCII

00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:16,170
cast yes I don't know to do that myself

00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:17,750
check pointers but yeah someone who

00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,619
wants to make an ascii cast of those

00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:22,170
it'll take you less than an hour and a

00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:29,400
half probably say at least to try to

00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:31,619
start come on I need a hand okay okay

00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:36,330
great I'll halfway help you we'll talk

00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:40,200
at lunch but since I seem to be here

00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:42,150
I think ASCII dot IO is a web page where

00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,530
you can record ASCII screencasts and

00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:45,300
they have a free software tool that

00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,970
records your terminal session and then

00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:51,450
lets it be played back in a browser not

00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:58,050
of the video but as like text I'll show

00:50:51,450 --> 00:51:00,740
you what you say it doesn't work yeah

00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:02,760
okay only what it work three for me

00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:06,450
other people ask questions while I

00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,860
figure out how the internet works do

00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:10,230
that oh do you see that package

00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:17,010
integrate with existing packaging to

00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:21,290
your package back look its text and I

00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:21,290
got recorded by this like random script

00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:28,710
no although I I don't remember if I mean

00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,910
as far as anyone can tell yes it's a

00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,440
totally random I'll attend to Kay to

00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:32,850
download script because that's the hip

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,470
way to install software nowadays sorry

00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:42,680
Debian but we should package it whatever

00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:42,680
but yeah

00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:47,279
in fact in my crazy opinion once we get

00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:48,990
that written we should just have it

00:51:47,279 --> 00:51:50,279
lying around on the bottom of Debian org

00:51:48,990 --> 00:52:06,180
when you scroll down it just shows you

00:51:50,279 --> 00:52:08,160
how to make a package like this what's

00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:16,170
the difference between script which in

00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:18,119
certain script and script replay the

00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,920
difference between script replay and

00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:20,700
this is that it makes it webpage just to

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,960
repeat for the video

00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,890
not that we're recording anymore or

00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,660
something I don't know her are you

00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:31,099
convinced now you're going to save us

00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:33,779
all I was at this Debian for shy people

00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:38,400
session also and the room was probably

00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:42,900
half the size but I raised the question

00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,930
about gender diversity then and from

00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:48,210
what I remember it wasn't really

00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:50,420
welcomed that question so I'm so so I'm

00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:53,160
so happy to see you now and actually

00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:56,460
like half your talk is about diversity

00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,839
and how to increase diversity I'm

00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,920
shocked and appalled to myself three

00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,160
years ago all of you guys see the video

00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:05,480
until you mean yeah I my memory might be

00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,480
blurry thanks

00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:20,550
yeah I can totally relate to that

00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:22,220
percent about not knowing what to do and

00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:25,110
I was thinking about it at the

00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:27,420
Doublemint talk as well maybe it might

00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:30,450
be helpful to have a list of racially

00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:33,210
wish list items as in things you can

00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:38,010
work on but there is no pressure on

00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:39,390
doing so as in if you succeed and do

00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:42,780
data yeah that would be great to have

00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:44,700
but there's not like it fits a bug and

00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:48,120
you try to fix any break it even worse

00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:51,270
then that's and also the feds all that

00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:54,840
in fact that was all in one place so can

00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:56,580
easily search for them that sounds great

00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:00,000
it should be a list of five bugs on a

00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:07,200
wiki page who will write that come on

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:11,100
necessarily bugs yeah I mean actually

00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:13,580
with with bugs themselves we've observed

00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:16,440
that we have the gift tag already but

00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:18,720
it's usually easier for the maintainer

00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,950
to actually fix the bug if it's easy to

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,780
fix than to tag it it's it goes faster

00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:29,100
and then you don't have to review any

00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:32,640
anymore or anything so yeah it's just

00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:34,230
easier to fix it than to give it away

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,330
but that's totally not the point like

00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:40,500
per says but that does mean therefore

00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:43,500
that when if when we're talking about

00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:46,470
these sorts of gift or entry-level tasks

00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,810
the person who's packaged is or who's

00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:52,410
community it is really needs to care

00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:55,650
about the onboarding part I think what I

00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:58,020
would if we just ran a fedora design

00:54:55,650 --> 00:55:00,960
bounty clone once for two months where

00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:03,210
somebody in some sub project said here's

00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,890
the task we need you to do it's easy

00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:06,120
I'll mentor you I think that would go a

00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,980
long way to addressing this it would

00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,330
also be time limited so people wouldn't

00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,230
be worried about leaving their bugs as

00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:14,220
gift too long

00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:16,830
I haven't comment as well in these lines

00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:18,390
um I think it might be a bit heretic but

00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,770
for me as well

00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:22,470
from personal experience it's kind of

00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:24,150
hard to go to a mentee or public web

00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:25,860
archived mailing list and ask a question

00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,040
without knowing whether I'm not going to

00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,410
make

00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,610
a total ass of myself right so maybe it

00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,840
would be good to have some point of

00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,400
contact that's actually a private

00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,020
mailing list which you don't need to

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,550
subscribe you just sent there there's a

00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:38,700
bunch of people who like to be welcoming

00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:40,230
and they answer you in private and why

00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,760
is he where to write your question

00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,650
publicly and tell you that's not that

00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,360
bad and might even check your mail you

00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:48,420
sent there so you're not making it total

00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:54,600
ass of yourself just to get that feeling

00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:56,310
out of person so I talked about calling

00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,350
something like the Debian welcoming team

00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:59,820
is it okay for called the debian member

00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:04,770
encouragement team or that just weirdly

00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:06,240
bureaucratic okay cool we'll call it

00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,590
Debbie in welcoming maybe we'll make a

00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,590
mailing list like that that's private

00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:14,720
for it also actually yapper had the mic

00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:17,100
then oh sorry

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,730
maybe who's contributor instead of

00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:21,930
member okay yeah oh and then it's like

00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:25,010
contributor and cursory team welcome

00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:25,010
whatever I'll call Debbie and welcoming

00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:31,770
that the weird thing about calling it

00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,900
the welcoming team is that I if we

00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:36,359
finish if we fully clone the event to

00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:38,099
strategy then we'll also have the

00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:41,310
welcoming team be getting in touch with

00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:43,170
people who like stopped uploading for

00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:57,450
three months which is kind of curious

00:56:43,170 --> 00:57:06,180
but I don't care it's fine oh yeah the

00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:11,060
video team used to go eat lunch yeah I

00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:13,290
thought the video was already over okay

00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:15,130
okay well feel free to end the video if

00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:24,289
that's what you're saying okay yeah all

00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:24,289
[Applause]

00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:29,849
right now can leave the mic open so for

00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:33,060
discussion yeah so just something about

00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:34,800
the idea of having tasks well easy task

00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:38,490
for new contributors we discussed that

00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:42,660
already but one idea could be to have a

00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:44,250
oka night-air package that plugs into a

00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,290
buck so that when you install a package

00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:50,599
you get a list of easy tags for the

00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:53,430
package you just installed and if any

00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:55,530
earlier list if mentioned mention it if

00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:57,660
the package is orphaned and you could

00:57:55,530 --> 00:58:00,660
adopt it maybe and that's actually

00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:02,460
really easy to do so you're going to do

00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:07,880
it is that right no that's not what I

00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,880
was going to say okay I'm going to do it

00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:16,680
[Laughter]

00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:17,670
but well I can provide directions for

00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,950
doing it

00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:25,020
no using unity as a data source to

00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:27,230
identify if you are interested just talk

00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,230
to me

00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:33,360
I have the same concerns that you had

00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:36,630
that's how we how do we make that I mean

00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:39,840
what you said is rather true it takes me

00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:42,570
less time to is fixable than to to

00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:45,540
explain anything so so I mean I think

00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:47,880
it's a that's general for for all the

00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:51,660
the packages and all the teams in in

00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:55,170
Debian in so I mean how do we get our

00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:59,130
over there how do we manage to to make

00:58:55,170 --> 00:59:01,860
people well describe the Box DC bags

00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:03,660
instead of fixing them well we had some

00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:06,840
answers so I guess I'll try to hear your

00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:08,100
answers before I try entering can I get

00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:12,690
in the back first because he had his

00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:18,180
hand up I think the answer should be

00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:20,460
just returned because that's it that's a

00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:23,130
problem you can't avoid when you want to

00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:25,710
maintain I have never meant that

00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:30,900
something which would not have been

00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:34,710
easier for me to do myself I don't think

00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:38,690
that's I think mentoring only works if

00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:38,690
