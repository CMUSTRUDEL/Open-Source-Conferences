can get started sure hey so this is

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:10,080
booter wrote about her router thank you

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,540
sure sorry rhymes with router and it's

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,969
cuter

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,350
and we're gonna be talking about Debian

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,330
Code of Conduct and it's a birds of a

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
feather session I expect that we'll be

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,080
running some microphones around you all

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,689
raise your hands and we'll get to you as

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,990
quickly as we can yes please

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,199
right just a few introductory words

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,910
first words is coming from I actually

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,210
started discussion on the Debian project

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,180
mailing lists while back to update the

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,040
code of conduct that we already have who

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,320
we are just a show of hands which one of

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,870
you has knows that we have a code of

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,370
conduct okay which one of you thinks

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,800
it's a good code of conduct well nobody

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,160
very confident just to show you I mean

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,120
this is our current code of conduct

00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,000
there are some things in there that I

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,579
think are fairly silly things like do

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
not send spam sent the advertising lick

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,729
up the advertising policy we have an

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,860
advertising policy for to deal with

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,510
spammers we don't actually ever use it I

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,189
don't think that's useful there's

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,760
something in here which i think is

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,470
totally irrelevant about swearing is

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,270
illegal and packaged radio so you should

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,060
not swear on our mailing lists I don't

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,070
know what that has to do with anything I

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,100
think it requires a citation you'd as

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,600
well because it's a packet or I don't

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,240
know anyway so I think this is totally

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,979
completely utterly useless as we have it

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,479
right now and we really either we should

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,970
throw it out or we should update it and

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,369
that's where this is coming from

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,250
originally I wrote some some proposals

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,259
on the Debian project mailing list we

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,180
had two drafts there and then it was

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,860
pointed out that maybe rather than

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,869
updating the mailing list code of

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,530
conduct we should migrate more towards a

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,509
generic generic code of comment that ID

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,610
held some merit but it's quite more time

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,060
than I had at the time so I did it your

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,159
deaf camp and the idea now is to go over

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,930
the proposal there are routes I'll close

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:10,500
this we can actually see and that we can

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:13,630
yeah discuss it may be updated after

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,010
that we'll have to post it to

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,480
some why the audience or other people

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,800
can contact you can comment on it as

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,190
well before we can of course put it to a

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,920
vote

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:26,290
so just to keep things a bit structure

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,300
here it is in Gobi everyone can eat it

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,430
but I would like to ask that we don't

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,660
just go ahead and change things but that

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,280
we actually discuss things first before

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,740
we update it should be fine

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,930
right off tonight I'll just go over what

00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,240
I wrote and then we can discuss things

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:45,150
first of all I wrote a little bit of my

00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:49,000
goals I think a code of conduct exists

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:53,800
primarily to improve collaboration and

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,570
to to - do you have people yeah do you

00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,240
give people tools to - to work against

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,750
people who are not really helping our

00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,120
community forward I think therefore it

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,550
should be a short I mean a short list

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,900
not a very long list because if it's 70

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:13,150
pages nobody's going to read that then

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,770
we might as well not have anything so

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,510
because of that you can't possibly

00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,320
enumerate everything so you should be

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,180
somewhat fake if we actually read all

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,730
the codes of conduct I think they are

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,810
similarly somewhat fake and I think it's

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:32,110
actually a good thing I don't actually

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:35,710
explicitly say so but in the code of

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,480
conduct itself but assuming common sense

00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,730
good sense from people who read it it's

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,170
probably a good thing to do those who

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,970
don't we can deal with an autumn matters

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,230
we shouldn't try to fix that before the

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,440
fact because we're not going to do that

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,920
anyway as I said I read several

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,270
community codes of conduct Stephan was

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,280
like you already actually made a list on

00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,220
the wiki and I went through each of them

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,880
read them I used some of the concepts

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,480
from them they're not much of a language

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,430
we'll see

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:09,160
so let's go a bit down the first item in

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,810
my list this people should be respectful

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,370
towards one another that's actually

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,700
something that comes up quite often in

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:18,910
the other course of conduct I so

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,320
basically the the the titles are meant

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,960
to be normative and the rest is meant to

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,180
be an explanation so the explanation

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,250
here is saying in a project the size of

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,550
Debian inevitably there will be people

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,800
we

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,690
whom you may disagree or find it

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,970
difficult to cooperate I think this is

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,460
true for any community give at this

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,379
particular size and we say accept that

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,090
but even if that is the fact even if you

00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:42,819
find someone difficult to cooperate with

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,440
remain respectful disagreement is no

00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:46,330
excuse for poor behavior or personal

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,500
attacks and a community in which people

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,919
feel threatened is not a healthy

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,389
community it's okay to disagree with

00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,069
someone it's not okay to let that

00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,680
disagreement turn into a problem for the

00:04:54,069 --> 00:05:00,039
community and so any comments on this if

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:03,789
people do we think this is a good thing

00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:10,240
to do yes go ahead

00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:12,250
I don't like the last phrase it's not

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,289
okay to let that disagreement turn into

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,620
a problem for the community community as

00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,340
a whole

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:21,969
uh-huh because I think it's a two side

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,650
saying of - well right other side right

00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:26,610
who communicate and Punk

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,900
it may be a bit harsh is what you say it

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:36,159
may be a bit harsh is what you're saying

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:39,130
or they um well well if I disagree with

00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:44,169
somebody want I'm called names

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,529
I don't react to that right may I see

00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,919
your point

00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:50,500
yeah may call me for for turning it a

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:55,210
problem for the community mm-hmm

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:59,590
so it sounds like you think there's a

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:06,039
bug in this because if somebody's not

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:07,180
being respectful to you I mean as far as

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,400
I understand it the situation you

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,750
described the person who is not being

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,879
respectful to you by calling you names

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,759
is already violating this and it would

00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,620
be helpful for everyone if everyone saw

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,729
that calling you names was a problem for

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,759
the community as a whole and you

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:23,379
reported that so I don't understand

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,469
what's wrong with the statement then it

00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:31,030
seems like you like it in the back

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:36,850
somebody give me a mic

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:39,250
I think that saying that it shouldn't

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:43,960
turn into a problem for the community as

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:46,780
a whole is giving it it too big scope so

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,020
that relatively small things might turn

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,330
into a problem for some people not

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,480
others so it's a problem to the

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:59,920
community as a whole no I think in the

00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:04,000
end it is but this phrase just makes it

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,450
open for too much into it right so we

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,090
should probably dub that facing the the

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,950
point is I wanted to final I finish a

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,650
statement that it's okay to disagree

00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:17,800
with someone but keep it reasonable some

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,210
somehow maybe this phrase is need to be

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,240
too strong and we need to drop it

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,040
you go ahead I don't think the problem

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,130
with it is that it's too strong I think

00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,680
that it's too vague or that okay what

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,630
you need to do is you need to say what

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,290
kind of disagreement is good and how we

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,580
should I'm not sure I have a good form

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,100
of words but we should have something

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,419
like it is okay to disagree with someone

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:47,290
this should be done in a positive way or

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:49,810
in a cognitive way right Lucas yeah my

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:52,750
point is similar actually I think that

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,590
this will be used as a way to punch

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,320
people

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,180
well I will point you to it showing that

00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,530
the behavior was not respecting they

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,750
could have conduct so you need to brief

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,110
some examples and some people need to be

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:08,080
why need to draw a line watch watch is

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:13,479
acceptable what isn't right graph it's

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:16,510
very hard to the only the only right the

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:20,080
only comment that I have with that is if

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,940
you start enumerated are bad then you

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,370
will inevitably forget something and

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,930
people will do something that is bad and

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,020
it's not in a list so it's fine

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:37,150
so I'd rather not go down that path but

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:40,419
I understand your point yes good I think

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:42,910
it's also a bit in the current wording

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,560
it's the problem that it speaks about

00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:48,310
dis equipment

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,650
in some form every disagreement is if it

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,250
takes a longer time a problem for the

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:57,730
community but even at this equipment in

00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,100
total respect if he cannot if it's about

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,080
something important right that we cannot

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:06,720
resolve it is a problem and it has

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,720
nothing to do about being respectful

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:16,420
yeah so maybe maybe should anybody have

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,330
been go ahead yeah perhaps it should

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:23,950
just mention what kind of disagreement

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:28,240
is is a good disagreement I mean when

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:34,140
you are offering technical aspects that

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:39,339
you think are valid points opposing your

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:43,240
discussion part no points then that's

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:45,730
okay if you turn it into a like personal

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:50,800
attack that which is already listed in

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:53,580
that explanation right it's just getting

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,100
it into the wrong path right and maybe

00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,380
this whole last place should just be

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,750
removed so and you mean from here II

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:05,020
hope yeah it's okay to have a

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,360
disagreement but but keep it on the on a

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,339
factual level instead of a personal

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,960
would anyone want to update that and I

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:15,460
think indeed going down that road is a

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,580
I was just gonna propose removing either

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,900
the it's not okay dot dot clause or

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,220
removing the entire sentence well I

00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,770
think that doesn't add anything

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,800
luckily okay so let's remove that part

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,600
at least if we're going to remove this

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,690
though I would certainly add some

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,100
qualifier but maybe this qualifier

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,780
that's that's the point that it was

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,670
meant to be a qualifier if that's not a

00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,690
good qualifier I can buy the document

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:42,010
but then we need something else instead

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,650
if you remove the whole sentence I think

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,910
the paragraph stands on its own anyway

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,490
just remove you okay remove the entire

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,540
internet removed from here then right

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,190
this is actually make there and get it

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,310
turning it into a title now it's not a

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:57,510
comment it is marked down so that's not

00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:01,110
a good idea right so

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:04,230
I mean yeah that we move that to right

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,420
thank you any more comments on this

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,160
paragraph or are we good

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,160
does that satisfy everyone's objections

00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:17,820
okay let's move on to the next one so

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:19,350
this one is assume good faith this is

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:24,089
actually something I think I came up

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:26,100
with myself and 120 short so what I've

00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:31,440
observed in many discussions is that

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:33,660
people will sometimes react to a point

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,699
on the assumption that people are out to

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:41,850
get them I'm putting it very well I'm

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,779
exaggerating here a bit but I think you

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,050
understand what I'm what I'm trying to

00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,519
say and the point here is to say to to

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,110
get people in the mindset that if

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,269
somebody is doing something that you

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,699
think is wrong assume they mean well

00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:57,060
because we're probably all basically

00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:59,370
trying to get get Debian forward we may

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,110
have differences in agreements in what

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,880
the best way to do that is but that

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,800
doesn't mean our end goal is different

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:10,019
and that and for that reason I think it

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:13,079
should be yeah that should be clear so

00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,089
I'll just read the paragraph first so

00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,529
what we say here is a project the size

00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:18,300
of Debian has many people working

00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,250
towards a common goal of a free

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,769
operating system with a link to what we

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,569
mean by free sometimes the ways in which

00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,569
we try to reach our goal may differ from

00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:29,250
one person to another and sometimes one

00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:31,680
person's immediate actions may be

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,199
contrary to other persons but please do

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,699
not assume that people are purposely

00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:36,690
working against your goals they may just

00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:40,440
have different goals that you don't

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,000
understand if in doubt ask remember that

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,860
is more likely that people are unaware

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,269
of their bad behavior then that I try

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,120
intentionally trying to degrade the

00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,319
quality of the discussion any comments

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,050
on this I think you have won't you go

00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:53,639
ahead right so I'm pretty happy with

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,790
what you're trying to do here in this

00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,160
first paragraph right um but I think the

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,959
wording could be improved firstly by

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,930
making it more personal so by saying

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,839
sometimes someone else's immediate

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:09,390
actions may be contrary to yours right

00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,220
yeah I think because that makes it seem

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,649
more personal

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,899
so it would be better to say that

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:19,459
somebody else's actions may seem

00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:21,360
contrary to yours and that is indeed

00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:23,670
failing to make the very assumption

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,519
right that we're telling people not to

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,519
make right right

00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:34,079
yeah me may seem to be I need all right

00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:35,940
okay can yeah I think that's fairly

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:41,040
non-controversial and plus someone

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:42,660
disagrees can we make a change this tile

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,790
in the previous paragraph you mentioned

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,709
operate of the size of Debian here a

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,019
regular of the size of Debian and next

00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,360
time insulin Debian is large and complex

00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,860
projects may be trickier if maybe that's

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,589
redundant yeah good point I hadn't

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,620
noticed that yeah thanks Rico go ahead

00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:01,170
I believe that description contradicts

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,709
the title of the description the moment

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:07,860
you assume good faith then you do not in

00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:11,730
my opinion you should not say that make

00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:14,760
go into details about people not

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:18,769
assuming good faith I mean when you say

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:23,490
do not assume other people are purposely

00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:26,640
working against the wrong goal if I'm a

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,980
new contributor and I read that I expect

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,550
to see a community with problems and

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,550
where the majority of people think that

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:39,690
everybody is out to get them

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:43,680
I believe the code of conduct should

00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:46,050
give the good example and assume good

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,959
faith on the people and then I can say

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,240
if in-depth assume good faith without

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,399
going into details saying don't do this

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,069
don't do that because it's right right

00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,810
and well it's a bit of the same problem

00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:59,940
with with the first point and it's

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,459
probably a structural problem of it all

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,230
which is the non-smoker problem when you

00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:09,209
see a non-smoking sign you feel like

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:15,449
smoking because that puts smoking into

00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:17,579
your mind right right I'll go out on a

00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:21,020
limb and assume you're you don't have

00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:24,470
any better suggestion to this paragraph

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:29,840
it would take me a while to think yeah

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:35,570
yeah that's what I thought I see a point

00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:40,190
but yeah in oh sorry great sorry forgot

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:45,620
it I think what about keep in mind that

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:48,140
we all have similar goals and that other

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,540
people might have only other means to

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,850
get there they basically yeah I like

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,260
that it's made more of form a

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,150
formulating in a positive sense rather

00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,710
than this somewhat negative sense I like

00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,970
that that's good right exactly that's

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,860
more or less what I was going to say

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,110
which is I think in general it would be

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,560
good idea to phrase everything in terms

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,270
of do this assume that rather than your

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,070
notes do not yeah right right right

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:17,630
right good idea so the question is only

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:20,450
how do we do that in this case anyone

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:24,020
willing to suggest a or are you doing

00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:26,360
the same thing yeah so I'm gonna read

00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,920
the paragraph but change it as I read it

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,330
right product the size of Debian has

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,420
many people working towards their common

00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:35,090
goal of a free operating system I'm just

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:39,020
keeping that sorry well that part was

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:42,530
just reading out loud this part you

00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:44,930
would not change go ahead the

00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,540
contributors of Debian have lots of ways

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:54,160
of reaching that goal reaching those

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,160
goals which may differ from your ways

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,670
that sounds good

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,530
I think what's well lots of sounds a bit

00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:09,170
informal though we can patch that up you

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:11,300
can pressure though later right it's

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:15,700
helpful to assume that other people are

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:19,360
working towards these goals semicolon

00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:21,680
when you wait we can fix it up later

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,970
keep on reading all thought yeah from

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,940
the video if you don't get it okay yeah

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:29,060
so for the next sentence it's helpful to

00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:31,340
assume other people are working towards

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,390
these shared goals semicolon if in doubt

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,600
comma ask

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:39,679
good and I'm not sure but it's helpful

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,260
to we can brag that I have a patch for

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,630
what you just said when you say the

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:49,210
contributors of Debian have I would

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,210
change with Debian contributors have

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,660
okay so I get my laptop but then so nice

00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:57,230
to me this microphone right weights

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,580
capitals obviously yeah I think I think

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,799
we are mostly in agreement that if we

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,809
phrase this as a positive rather than a

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,600
negative explanation we should be fine

00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:08,299
yeah strong go ahead yeah I'm just

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,260
thinking one of your goals is to keep

00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:13,309
this short

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:16,940
Roger so I think that the first sentence

00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:18,890
just doesn't really belong there we all

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,190
know we are talking about devian we all

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:24,620
know it has kind of come and go point

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,059
good point so it's it doesn't know we

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,620
need it doesn't really add to this

00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:28,910
explanation we can start off by saying

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,330
we have a common goal

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:34,700
yeah win period and then oh just the

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,840
Debian contributors have a common goal

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:42,160
and there are many ways to achieve that

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:45,280
and and stating that level of obvious

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,120
does risk sounding patronizing a bit

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:53,809
fair enough yeah okay

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:55,580
so yeah I think that's that's fair so we

00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:57,169
need to reduce that and turn it to the

00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,100
positive is it's somebody in the back he

00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,730
wants to make a statement

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,630
oh very good if we want to put it in a

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,270
positive way

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,250
mm-hmm we may I don't have the words but

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,620
I have the idea we should all we could

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,270
say that everyone has different goals

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:15,290
and different ways and that's a good

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,790
thing and yeah right the fact that you

00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:20,559
have different ways does necessarily

00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,559
mean it's bad points the point

00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:29,020
somebody's making very good

00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:36,100
while that happens I any ask my question

00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:38,109
yeah you had a point or yeah my point

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,940
was we discussed about this agreement

00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:41,470
before and I think I mean that's quite

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,729
an important point because actually this

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,830
whole whole document is about this

00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:45,909
agreement or disagree right situation

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,330
yeah maybe we should have an

00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:50,470
introductory point that actually

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,479
mentions that we're happy about this

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,879
agreement because it helps improve and

00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:56,409
there could go all this discussion about

00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:58,509
their units large your produces we have

00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:59,950
many people we we expect to have

00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:01,570
disagreement right and we're actually

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,789
happy about that very good point

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,769
so here is how we want to handle this

00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:07,989
because it helps us to be able to

00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:12,849
produce a better product let me go up

00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:15,309
and see right so that probably would go

00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:17,320
I think that in here appreciating that

00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:22,899
we have disagreements is actually for

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:24,970
the next section that's title again the

00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:27,429
collaborative collaborative maybe maybe

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:35,289
should make this the first section maybe

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:37,869
yeah I guess right so this this part

00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:41,080
actually comes from the KDE and some

00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:43,840
Oaks credit when I first read the

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,869
headline for this assume good faith

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:53,289
mmm-hmm I think should also be mentioned

00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:56,440
sort of language barrier people tend to

00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:59,940
not be native speakers in such a big

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,919
project and there's also room for

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,229
misinterpretation because people

00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:08,379
understand certain words in a different

00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:10,869
way I did consider that when should be

00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:14,379
put somewhere I did consider when

00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:15,940
writing the original draft of this but

00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:17,739
decided against it because it became too

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,320
long if you start enumerated all

00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:21,970
possible ways in which people could be

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,090
misinterpreted as not being of good

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,830
faith so it's it's points but I unless

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,840
you strongly disagree with it I don't

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,849
think it really belongs in there so now

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,970
yeah I was just

00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:36,309
commanding that it's not only that many

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,109
people are not native speakers but we

00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:41,330
come from a lot of different cultures

00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:43,130
exactly and that often means that

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,160
the same word if understood correctly

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,960
can mean widely different things so and

00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,310
that's exactly the reason why I didn't

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,600
want to enumerate because there's too

00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:54,200
many ways in which it could be

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,360
misunderstood well no I just think we

00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,390
should keep that in mind maybe we might

00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,970
add a small section about this to just

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:09,800
be aware of differences in in language

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:14,840
and culture right we'll see right so any

00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:17,650
more comments on this section no okay

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:22,490
we'll move on to the next one

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:33,950
yeah you do that yet still the that's

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:35,420
your patch anyone have I think this

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,240
looks really well and you know my

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,910
opinion anyone feel opposed to this to

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,380
replace my proposal with a shishas

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:49,880
version here yeah all right two mics use

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:52,400
a bit too much it sounds it has a little

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,730
bit of danger that we get the new

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,920
standard insult that people will ask on

00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,950
the mailing list are you doing this in

00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:05,060
good faith which could be the new form

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:06,490
of asking are you falling that's a good

00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:10,730
point

00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:13,910
sorry if I miss it but ask whom and ask

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:16,610
where is that no it's not specified yeah

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:19,670
but just otherwise maybe just drop it or

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,200
I don't know because right people will

00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,790
just ask well if you if you're in doubt

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,050
then you're not assuming it anyway so

00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:26,540
maybe we should just drop if in doubt

00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:28,130
assume good face right that's what the

00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,260
exact the entire section is saying so

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:36,110
the if in doubt part should maybe just

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:38,810
leave even if I do agree that asked

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,850
thing shouldn't be there it should be

00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,000
somewhere too because it it terrifies a

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:47,540
lot of a lot of stuff whenever you

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,610
you're maybe maybe we can add this to

00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,700
the section that span was talking about

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,580
about introduction yeah there you go

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,580
I'd like to point out that most

00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,909
what I see there is completely redundant

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:03,549
with the Debian diversity statement some

00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:06,279
of it is you told this at the bar to me

00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:11,640
earlier yeah basically because actually

00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:13,779
that green thing is a longer and well so

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,779
beautiful basically what the first thing

00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:19,419
I think about what the the diversity

00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:20,769
statement says is we welcome you if

00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:22,299
you're constructive

00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:26,950
something like that I don't know in that

00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:28,690
case it's no matter how you describe

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:31,440
yourself oh this one yeah this part yeah

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,440
that's true that's true

00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:38,620
I think they should add to the diversity

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,750
statement otherwise or it should

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,539
compliment the diversity statement and

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,929
not try to replace it no you point I see

00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:46,389
your point

00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:48,480
um don't go ahead yeah I I don't think

00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:51,940
that repetition here is really bad

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,000
because many people might be aware of

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,190
the diversity statement but many people

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,679
won't and won't actually read it even if

00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,169
they get a link to it well many people

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:07,960
actually look actively for code of

00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:11,620
conduct the code of conduct can link to

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,149
the statement the statement is three

00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,460
lines so it can be at the beginning of

00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:23,769
the code of conduct that's also other

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:26,230
batteries yeah right anything else all

00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:28,480
right I'm sorry I don't know your name

00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:32,409
I've been just pointing towards you

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,769
there anywhere I can tweet from here all

00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:38,440
right okay good I think the diversity

00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:40,960
statement mind might be a bit of a

00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,120
distraction here because it's a little

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,970
bit different diversity is like a

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,679
statement is that we accept people

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:56,350
coming from different things here is

00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:58,200
it's more about the the different

00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:02,100
language we speak

00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,450
including culture in language okay I

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,970
would like to move on now because we are

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,500
about half a my talk you know a lot of

00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:12,280
time and we're not halfway through

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,290
materials not even remotely so we can we

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,180
can discuss this at length on the

00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:19,720
mailing list I've I think it's clear

00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:22,360
that we need to do that we at least the

00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,160
worst parts have been removed tonight so

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,250
let's just move on to the big

00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,010
collaborative this I actually got from

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:33,220
Kady mostly and some other projects that

00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:35,260
have similar laws in there again the is

00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,000
large we should probably remove that as

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,770
baby said it is impossible for any

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,770
person to us and do not be afraid to ask

00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:43,150
for help when you need it there is no

00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,010
shame in accepting that one cannot do a

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,570
particular job on their own similarly an

00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,610
offer for help should not be seen as a

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,710
personal attack when you made something

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,900
for the project benefit of the project

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,730
be prepared to explain to others how it

00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,920
works so that they can build on your

00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:00,430
work to make it even better and you

00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:04,540
could go ahead there is no shame in blah

00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:08,830
is patronizing possibly anytime it

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:11,980
possibly just spins I think this

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:16,330
document should be an enabling document

00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:19,210
so I would see I would be happy to see

00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:25,060
lots of phrases starting with it is okay

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:28,450
to rather than there is no shame in so

00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:49,570
it is okay to ask for help

00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:52,510
right it is okay to I see yeah I said

00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:54,820
that it is actually good to accept that

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:59,920
you can't do everything on your own

00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:02,910
right and especially anyone want to

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:08,020
change it in that manner you alright

00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:10,500
okay thank you what happens there all

00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,500
right good

00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:20,879
this is tournaire - very interesting

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:25,409
anything else that we want to modify on

00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:27,659
this section or is it good I'll just

00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:32,999
scroll down bit with Ashish doing rather

00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:37,679
weird things it's not that much I have

00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:41,029
to admit that prepare to expect

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:45,929
yeah okay I gotta be prepared to explain

00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:47,909
part sounds a bit threatening for me it

00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:51,659
sounds like yeah you can do it but be

00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:55,559
prepared yeah this this part this is

00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:57,299
because I want to make collaborative it

00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:59,070
you can only collaborate if it comes

00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,950
from both sides and I wanted to point

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,629
that out too but yeah given the I mean I

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:10,289
only written this on myself by myself

00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:12,350
and baby go ahead not the mic is off I

00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,350
think

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:23,879
it's not working is it I

00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:27,119
I like maybe not maybe the wording could

00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:30,389
be changed but I but I guess what you

00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:33,539
would you what we would like to say here

00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:35,850
is that whenever you propose something

00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:39,240
try something do something some people

00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:41,159
are gonna ask you about that and because

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,070
it's a collaborative thing so right so

00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,809
don't be prepared to explain I like that

00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,269
fact maybe with her with other words

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:50,340
right I like that because it means like

00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:52,649
you're not working alone and people are

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,360
gonna ask about yeah I'm gonna ask you

00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:55,860
about it that's indeed my philosophy

00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,190
behind it but I understand that it could

00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:01,379
be sound somewhat threatening so the

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:04,470
main question is how we take that out of

00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:06,059
it but but that was indeed my my my my

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:10,559
follow up my philosophy but in in in

00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:17,869
writing it so we'll link with three L's

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,869
interesting any other comments

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,120
she's go ahead oh sorry my friend this

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:32,919
is work what do you think of my patch do

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:34,750
you want to merge it it's it's minus

00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,850
minus minus minus minus plus puzzle

00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,400
actually it's I could run W diffic you

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,990
want it no it looks looks I think it

00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,900
looks okay but I don't know about other

00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:47,799
people any comments on a she she's

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:53,490
version yeah

00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:55,990
good didn't we happen it's good to us

00:30:53,490 --> 00:31:04,480
it's okay to ask it's good to ask you I

00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:06,880
think we said it's good to ask anything

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:14,409
else now let's move on to the next

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:17,770
section try to be concise this is both

00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:21,130
to avoid long emails and to avoid long

00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:25,090
threats both are problem if people sent

00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:27,669
you an email with 70,000 pages then

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,080
nobody's going to read it and it's or or

00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:31,510
you need to postpone it and that's not

00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,330
really helpful if people sent the same

00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:36,340
message to a threats over and over and

00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,110
over and over and over and over and over

00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,850
again like some people tend to do then

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,850
you have an issue there as well so

00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:44,320
that's what this is trying to be to

00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,390
discourage it I actually found that in

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,000
one of the other codes of conduct I

00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:50,289
think this was in the genome one making

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,539
conversation larger makes it more

00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:54,490
difficult to follow writing a long email

00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:56,919
means people may have to invest large

00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:58,809
amounts of time to understand it when a

00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,580
long explanation is nary is necessary

00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:03,010
consider whether a summary is

00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,600
appropriate try to avoid repeating

00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,970
arguments that have already been brought

00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,649
forward this rarely serves any useful

00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,929
purpose try to stay on topic especially

00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:13,179
in discussions that are are already

00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:17,950
fairly large any comments on this

00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:20,649
section and you go alright I will just

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,510
keep the title and the Horner the point

00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:26,049
you're trying to make by giving an

00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:29,880
example try to be concise no text

00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,880
skip to the following one

00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:39,010
that would be interesting but and it's

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:43,050
far too verbose for something that's

00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,050
trying to tell me to be Cohen sighs I

00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:50,710
see a point Ashish all right

00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:53,800
by contrast the idea about adding a

00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,290
summary is kind of novel I mean so there

00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:02,890
is some content here yeah that's that's

00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:04,450
what I was hoping for it's already a

00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,610
fader if you have to add a memory I

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:09,870
don't think so I mean it's just it's not

00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:13,300
a summary summary for the long email

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:15,970
well some things just can't be explained

00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,860
in ten words and DubLi needs a long

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:19,600
explanation I mean I've been there

00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:23,320
myself when for instance when we went to

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,900
the keel for an m60 at a meeting we know

00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,310
it was something else it was a we I gave

00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,470
very long technical explanation of why

00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:31,830
something was necessary and then I just

00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:35,710
explained but this is what we really

00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:38,050
suggest sometimes you can't go around it

00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,380
and it makes sense in some cases to do

00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:43,720
that I think right maybe if we would

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,820
like to make a point here in addition to

00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:50,620
suggesting using a summary we could also

00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:52,780
suggest structuring the the X for the

00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:55,990
long email like in articles so you have

00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:58,360
a short summary in the beginning runner

00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:00,670
and structured email because you can

00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,440
follow us long structured email while

00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,440
you can't really follow an unstructured

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,060
one easily was incorrect honestly I

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,020
don't think we should really come up

00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:12,580
with new ideas to structure emails in

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,149
this code of conduct at least not in the

00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:17,889
first version I mean this should be also

00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:20,919
about the current practice which is

00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,389
positive and not trying to I mean this

00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:23,950
is an experiment and you say everybody

00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:25,450
should start a summary maybe it goes

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,649
nowhere and it's really bad and people

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,470
start complaining where's your summary

00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:33,490
and so

00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:35,169
and it's all finished so I I mean I

00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:37,599
don't I think the idea is good I mean we

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:39,099
should we should explore it but maybe

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,560
not in the code of conduct but first

00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:43,450
outside of it and then it if it's good

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,329
if I did it well we just put it in in

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:49,480
the second version I did try to to make

00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:53,970
it clear that I said consider adding a

00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,970
summary I didn't say add a summary with

00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,800
well yeah well the the pony was ready to

00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:04,329
say um maybe okay sometimes this may be

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,650
helpful but it's something you need to

00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:09,069
decide there you go

00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:12,310
what I need was talking about the IETF

00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:17,200
must shall definitions and so on I think

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:21,099
he nailed something that I was asking

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,849
myself so far I appreciate that this is

00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:27,160
a dump

00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:29,740
or well it's the formulation of Arkansas

00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,849
concerns that are shared by many Debian

00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:38,650
developers right let's go right but how

00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:43,420
so it's it could be like we are

00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:45,609
concerned about these and and I respect

00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:49,119
those concerns and I share many of them

00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:51,640
myself right but how is this code of

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,560
conduct going to help is it a tool for

00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,960
them to kick people out

00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,380
is it guidelines to teach new developers

00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,930
addicts coming down we're not there yet

00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:05,410
we're not at that part yet but any

00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:09,069
further comments on this section

00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:12,250
anyway I cannot give comments until I

00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:15,670
know what's the point of this right in

00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:21,339
the back yeah I'll come there soon I

00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:25,300
hope it's useful to know what this is

00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:30,160
all about I'll skip you that on I was

00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:32,560
actually only one part here which tries

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,940
to encourage open communication as

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,470
opposed to private communication within

00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:40,930
Debian in yeah and referring to the

00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:43,500
social contract paragraph 3 which has we

00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,500
don't high problems

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,720
I'm not sure if this is really necessary

00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:52,140
either day I think it was a good idea

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,490
but maybe it's not basically what I was

00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,700
referring to is the in case of problems

00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:58,859
as follows now we'll come back to the if

00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,270
open if we have time of the open if you

00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:03,720
have time and otherwise we'll just look

00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:06,180
at this and the idea here is to say I'm

00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,230
so it says literally well this code of

00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,970
conduct should be adhered to by

00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,579
participants we recognize that sometimes

00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,470
you may have a bad day or be enough

00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:15,119
we're unaware of some of the rules in

00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,829
this code of conduct when that happens

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,049
you may reply to them and point out this

00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:20,910
code of conducts such messages may be in

00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:23,640
public or in private whatever is most

00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,410
appropriate however regardless of

00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,579
whether the message is public or not it

00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,230
should still adhere to the relevant

00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,849
parts of this kind of conduct in

00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,760
particular it should not be abusive or

00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:34,650
disrespectful assume good faith it is

00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,299
more like that participants are unaware

00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,950
of a bad behavior then that they

00:37:36,299 --> 00:37:39,690
intentionally tried to degrade the

00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,579
quality of the description repeated

00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,049
offenders may be temporarily or

00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,270
permanently banned from communicating

00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:47,039
through Debian systems at the mediums

00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:49,109
administrators prerogative that's what

00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,539
it says so basically yeah ten minutes

00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:54,029
left so basically the idea here is to

00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:58,349
try to have people enforced by

00:37:54,029 --> 00:38:00,210
themselves most people if told in in

00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:04,680
private that they're doing things that

00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:08,700
they think are are not are not helpful

00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,500
will change the way stupid flies will

00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:14,940
change the way they are they are acting

00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:18,420
and some will not but list matters today

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,220
already will will temporarily banned

00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,690
those people from our lists IRC

00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,430
operators will temporarily already bend

00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,900
those from people from from IRC and I

00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,950
think that that kind of way works well

00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,250
go ahead

00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:31,589
did you have anything to say or are you

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:35,190
just holding a mic I'm just holding a

00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:36,500
mic anyone anyone have any comments on

00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,740
that yeah right

00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:43,559
what does mediums administrators play

00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:47,279
means originally this set because which

00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,900
is this I as I read it I fell over the

00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:51,119
those centers and I don't like it myself

00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,059
and anyway it all reason you said at the

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,230
list masters prerogative but so the idea

00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:57,840
was that

00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:03,600
it is their judgment call whether or not

00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:07,200
so so our these list masters Debian well

00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:11,720
leaders delegates or I think they are

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Lucas no no because then I think that a

00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:20,780
bad description the the idea here

00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:23,010
basically is that people should at first

00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,170
comment when they think somebody's

00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,750
misbehaving and if that doesn't happen

00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,430
we should talk to

00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,240
ideally somebody who is indeed a

00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,250
delegate

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,900
I thought list masters were if they're

00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,020
not then we need to maybe need to

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,250
revisit that there you go

00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,770
when you suggest that the code of

00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:48,000
conduct should be pointed out to people

00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:50,550
right I see so that means that the code

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,280
of conduct becomes something that

00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:58,619
people's might in my face every time I'm

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,340
having a bad day it's a recipe for

00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:03,210
disaster

00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,570
I it's there's no way people get to like

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,930
it

00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:08,580
there's it well it's it's a strategy

00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,800
that means that people will increasingly

00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:14,220
get to hate it because it will be used

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,530
by patronizing self-righteous people

00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,970
that decide that they're better than

00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:25,109
everybody else that they and they send

00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:26,970
everyone but if it's something you point

00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:29,609
people when they don't behave in an

00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:33,420
optimal way then it's a guideline right

00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:37,500
if it's something that brings people to

00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:40,560
be banned then it's a normative thing

00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,810
right the two things not necessarily fit

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,240
in the same document if it's something

00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:48,359
that you are banned from then it's like

00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,340
don't do this don't do that if it's

00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:54,000
something that is a guideline then it's

00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:56,400
like doing this is better doing the idea

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,740
is that I mean repeated offenders the

00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,869
idea is that people who are yeah ashish

00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:05,010
wanted to say something to the idea it

00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:08,700
really is that people who really cross

00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:10,770
the line by a very large extent would be

00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:13,470
fans because we don't really want them

00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,490
whereas if you do this occasionally it's

00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,690
not really a big deal

00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:17,270
sheesh I think it's interesting

00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,520
theoretical problem I don't know of any

00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:22,710
I think it's an interesting theoretical

00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,599
problem Enrico I don't think that it's

00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,920
been a practical problem for any of the

00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,359
dozens of communities that have had

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,400
occurred of conduct and I think that's

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,900
interesting by itself even those

00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,680
communities that have codes of conduct

00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,480
maybe was a counterexample that are that

00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,450
contain lines like this I also want to

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,070
mention that to some to make a long

00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:44,400
story very short and make it record on

00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:47,089
Def Con video forever a kind of troll I

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,920
kind of accidentally trolled the UD UD s

00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:52,380
key signing party a year and a half ago

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,839
not realizing that I was being a jerk

00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,430
and the person who's organizing it

00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:57,690
emailed me and said hey I don't think

00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,579
you were and point to whatever line

00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,650
means be respectful being respectful to

00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,390
me as the organizer and I was like oh

00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:06,060
wow I feel awful and then I had a

00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:07,079
conversation with him and then we all

00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,910
came to a happy conclusion that's

00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,710
exactly the the kind of behavior that I

00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:12,390
was expecting myself to and that I would

00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:14,660
like to encourage or would like to see

00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:17,160
encouraged by people indeed if people

00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,660
start pointing out because people are

00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,730
having a bad day then they're not really

00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,900
really being respectful either and

00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:26,550
they're hopeful and the code of conduct

00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:28,079
themselves either so right so I'm one of

00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:31,609
the main reasons for having a code of

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,680
conduct is because precisely the people

00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:38,369
the forum administrators like this

00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,319
masters need really to have a clear

00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:42,720
mandate from the rest of the project

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:45,660
about what it is that we are expecting

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,579
them to do for us with respect to the

00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:52,650
you know policing your behavior on the

00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:55,109
lists and therefore and that is one of

00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:58,560
the main purposes of something like a

00:42:55,109 --> 00:43:01,200
code of conduct now the problem of being

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,730
slapped down in public over alleged

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,520
violations I think that should be dealt

00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:10,470
with in the code itself you should say

00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:13,140
you know don't do that that's a short

00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:16,050
five minutes anyway I just wanted to

00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:19,200
respond to a shishas comment that it's

00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:21,910
never a problem in fact people use the

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,130
current Debian list code of

00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:26,319
in at least an irritating way I don't

00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:28,960
know if it's actually destructive but it

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,539
doesn't seem constructive to me in many

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:36,670
cases to tell people that they shouldn't

00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:38,230
CC I totally I mean I can sew it and you

00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:41,260
could argue that that's just because the

00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:43,180
list code of conduct is maybe not as

00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:46,750
constructive as it could be but it's not

00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:49,599
no III agree and I I mean it's actually

00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:51,910
you may if not there's a section here

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,490
we'll probably won't have the time to to

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:58,750
go over this one its contains some

00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:00,640
specific codes meant to be clear on one

00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:06,130
list for email this one for is C and

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:07,750
this one for one a Debian I think these

00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:11,319
this is actually based on the draft that

00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:13,240
I sent to that project originally so I

00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:17,020
have not changed as much and you may

00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:20,410
notice that the CC stuff in there is

00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:22,000
it's not it's just totally out of that

00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:24,880
because I completely disagree with that

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,680
with that kind of thing that apparently

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:33,579
we're out of time but yeah go ahead one

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,770
thing is if people point out that

00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:38,920
someone's misbehaving and and it feels

00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:42,309
like you're being slapped in the face

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,140
then usually the people that are

00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:46,630
pointing it out to you or they're not

00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:50,980
other people that are not following the

00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:53,619
code of contact and that's something you

00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,670
can't really address in that way there

00:44:53,619 --> 00:45:00,819
are people that will always be

00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:03,039
disrespectful when pointing it out weary

00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:11,829
yeah one one more then I will stop and

00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:16,480
all maybe it would be useful to have

00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:19,359
some kind of tips to help things not to

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,400
escalate like having something that that

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:24,010
is out of the code of conduct but

00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,380
something you could have a look to help

00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:30,760
you cool down and not react I actually

00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:34,359
put a further reading section at the end

00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,770
with a link to Enriquez x1 documents the

00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:38,470
Debian community guidelines

00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:39,760
and maybe some some links some other

00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,980
links that could be out there I'm

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,220
absolutely sorry but yeah I know yeah we

00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:46,540
have run out of time I intend to take

00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,330
this and put it on the mailing list

00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,220
they're being project with annotations

00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:53,050
what we managed to discuss urine is both

00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,450
and what we didn't manage to discuss so

00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,800
that will be clear and I hope the

00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,880
discussion will go on there and then

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,280
we'll see what happens

00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,819
thank you and thank you later

00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,819
