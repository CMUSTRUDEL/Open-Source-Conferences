okay so thank you for coming and waking

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:09,120
up early for this buff someone yesterday

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,880
evening came to me and that told me oh I

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,259
have something I would really like to to

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,289
come to the Buffett actually I have only

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:21,330
one thing to say to you so if I say no I

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:23,869
can sleep he's not here today I will

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,869
protect his identity

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,210
soo-ji originally when Zach started DPLA

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,170
personal initiative I think there were

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,660
three big axis of motivations for that

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,750
the first one was to share the DPI work

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,649
workload so that went less work to do

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,140
for DPL and more tasks that I that

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,610
usually falls fall into DP the DPL

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:55,680
domain get done more than just one that

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,899
really must be done in any case and also

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,420
there was the idea of giving prospective

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,809
dpi candidates a way to discover so DPL

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,390
workload and test themselves on the own

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:13,979
in the process does it that reflect what

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:15,960
you yeah totally it was also to be more

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,299
transparent about the DPL doe does and

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,970
actually you know show what's going on

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:28,290
it's possibly a sub point of the second

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:38,759
one but yeah thanks yep attend it won't

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:42,210
fit we'll wrap even really way okay so

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,200
I've tried to go through micron to-do

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,960
list and pick up items that could be

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,090
done by someone else so for some of them

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,520
it's really easy for someone else to do

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,799
them for some of them it's much harder

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,619
to see all someone else could do it but

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,119
well let's see so I'm just going to go

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,649
through them quite quickly just so that

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,290
you know what's hidden behind the

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,969
descriptions so the first one so that

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:11,060
one is about

00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:13,790
basically the infamous library required

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,390
to play encrypted DVD we have a legal

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,130
advice 200 to package it in the beyond a

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,730
package is ready it needs to be reviewed

00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:25,160
by FP masters and then SF LC so that can

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,930
get to Debian and it's currently blocked

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:33,470
in that state for the last three months

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:36,110
so in some booking so a second one is we

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:40,280
have this great new NM website developed

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,650
mainly by enrico we have the DM workflow

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,349
it is completely separate it would make

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,630
sense to try to fit so DM workflow

00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:51,430
inside the animal panel website and see

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,430
oh we can do that

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:59,599
send us several things that are related

00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:02,120
to delegation so the release team is not

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,040
delegated currently it would make sense

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,790
to have it delegated so that its powers

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:11,540
are more explicitly stated like like

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,160
it's well done well for example when

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,980
they decide we move packages from

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,140
testing or - well that's the kind of

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,239
thing that can be quite controversial

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,400
inside the project needs it would be

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:28,100
nice to have a way to say yes so I can

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,889
do that same 420 Medford Mac team with a

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,200
brand new trademark team I need to

00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,600
prepare well someone needs two people to

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,090
prepare draft of the delegation we have

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:49,160
some ideas we can done but seem to be

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:55,519
consolidated so di is quite well is not

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:57,410
really active development run di so our

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,139
call for app should be prepared and

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,299
posted to appropriate mailing list that

00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:04,880
we can try to recreate a volunteer for

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,190
it so it's like it we just need to write

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,530
a job description and work on that with

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,980
key B with Chris Kirk is the most active

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,700
person on the eye

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:18,060
as a Dibya Nivens team is I was told the

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,470
Libyan events team is kind of Maa so

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,790
just need to ping it see what's the

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:27,310
problem and see what could be done

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:30,460
etcetera as a press team delegation it

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,660
needs an update someone stepped down as

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,520
someone that could be convinced to

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:42,250
increase the activity maybe it's not

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:44,320
clear related to the code of conduct

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,410
discussion that's the question whether

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,050
list master should be delegated if they

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:53,020
makes a decision to ban someone from the

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:57,970
list and and delegate it that's a bit

00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:00,220
strange from the well maybe it's not

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,860
necessary but well we so we need to

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,900
think about it

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,600
so then there's a big big set of items

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,160
that are about easing contributions so I

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,949
think that this is something that is

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:18,360
very important for the project so most

00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,360
of them are quite

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:27,030
when one do you have questions and some

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:36,300
of them I think the label is more

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:36,300
explicit and for the first set okay

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:46,060
- some of them are really packaging

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,130
related I since I originally originally

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,500
wrote packaging tutorial I have some

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,710
items that related to that but that's

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,000
clearly something that could be the dip

00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:04,150
here doesn't need to maintain the

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:07,060
documentation and then values items so I

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,790
did some usage statistics about testing

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,240
with FTP that be loves it would be

00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:15,040
interesting to confirm those results

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,490
with other logs so vast Amazon

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,750
CloudFront which is used as a as part of

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:27,460
HTTP Debian net and also FTP dot MX dot

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,950
who provides the logs for that I have

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,790
two well gee pls to write or someone has

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:35,560
to fight for the DPL a paragraph in the

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,700
DEFCON final report I think it's more

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:44,830
than one paragraph actually I haven't

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:49,090
looked at it yet ESA tends to make

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:51,660
things too well require a lot of small

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,310
expenses such as buying cables or

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,320
shipping servers around it's a bit

00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,870
stupid that's each time they do that and

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,290
ask for 100 euros they need to go

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:05,710
through DPL approval so they wondered if

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:09,940
we couldn't have something like so they

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:13,270
are allowed to make 200 well expense of

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:16,030
no more than 200 euros every 7 days so

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,370
that just don't need to stop you know

00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,840
when they start working on something to

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,350
ask for the girl power and of course not

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,860
notify DPL and auditors that which is

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:29,830
happening but the word worst case it

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,250
means I spend 200 euros and something we

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:37,030
don't really want but we can afford that

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:41,760
probably so yeah this needs to be based

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:44,830
on - project so that we can have a

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,300
project wide discussion about it and

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:52,050
then some mediation

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:55,139
well one mediation specifically in the

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:59,030
Alexi package was a Debian template that

00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:01,979
is quite different from what upstream

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:04,620
provides and apparently many users are

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:07,410
quite unhappy about that and prefer to

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,960
use be Ubuntu package also that template

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:14,550
was broken in with Z which is shame so

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,259
someone needs to talk to the Alexa

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:30,960
maintainer about that and see what can

00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:33,209
be done yeah so really I think that you

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,789
start a quite different in nature and

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,940
not all of them could be addressed the

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:41,320
same way for example for some of them

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,789
the rule of

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,970
the other person would be to write a

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:49,160
draft and then the when the draft well

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,470
it provides a draft to GD P L modify it

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,030
and send it to GD a for example example

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,430
for delegations that the case doesn't

00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:58,420
make sense to wouldn't work to delegate

00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:03,590
the ability to send delegations that's

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:05,750
that would be quite broken for some of

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,760
them it's about doing all the actual

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,660
work actually like brightens the meter

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,100
patch maintained packaging tutorial and

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,350
doesn't need to be done by the DPL

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,610
there's no special order which he

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:22,840
required to do that for some of them

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:25,910
it's more like come up with a summary of

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,470
options while looking to the issue come

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,100
up with a summary of options and

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,870
recommend something to to the DPL and

00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,030
for some of them is more about providing

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,800
while looking at which initial very

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:41,950
detailed feedback on an idea well the

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:45,200
last two are quite similar actually so

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:48,230
the more people in the room and the sum

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,410
of people who ever attended the PLL pass

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,110
both so the obvious question is what are

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:58,370
you reasons for not taking a DPL I first

00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,760
asked yet and then oh can I help you

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,760
pick one

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:10,890
so if the answer to the first two

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:13,170
questions are it's not possible I would

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,930
never do that maybe we should think

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,000
about reducing our expectation

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:21,450
expectations of what the DPL does that's

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,270
also something that we it might be a

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:33,990
good thing to allow people with more

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:36,240
diverse well personal work well day job

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:40,310
and stuff like that to apply for the pl

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:47,690
because we have kind of a shortage of

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:47,690
people in French academia in 200 JPL so

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,490
and well maybe one question waited to

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,410
that is maybe you could just the DPL

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,180
just try other to offload work to the

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,950
relevant teams the problem is that the

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,200
11 teams are usually teams that are

00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:07,080
already quite busy with lots of other

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:12,440
things so it's not really just moving

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:16,170
the problem to the next step so well

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:26,490
maybe start with that wants to to

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:30,540
comment about about that so with

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:32,280
so I guess I'm fairly typical in there

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,020
I'm vaguely interested in helping but I

00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,840
have 46 other things to do and I don't

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,580
really need to do any DPL tasks you know

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,260
I'd like to help but you know mostly I'm

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,820
too busy with all the other things I was

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,700
supposed to be doing already firm not

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,650
even necessarily just for Debian and I

00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,410
guess that applies to what a lot of

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,940
people say I didn't really have any

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,190
answers I'm just saying that work done

00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,900
anything yet so I turn up and listen and

00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,130
see what's going more interest in this

00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,310
and I used to for the last seven years

00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:03,150
you know I have actually come to this

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:04,770
and been to at least one IRC meeting so

00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,220
you know approaching actually doing

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,220
something maybe

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:27,370
so for some of the tasks I don't see why

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,700
they are listed as DPL does like the

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:34,930
packaging tutorial things or the high

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:37,660
GPA template yeah well usually well for

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:40,300
many DPL tests and no strong reason for

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:43,420
the DPL to make them but if the DPL

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,980
doesn't do them well usually it doesn't

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,900
happen so it might be that they are not

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,610
important enough but I think that most

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,320
of the people in the project agree that

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,440
we have a problem attracting new

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,660
contributors and that we could do better

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,460
so no no no I know I'm not saying those

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,880
are not tests that should be addressed I

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:03,460
just don't see why they are DPL tasks

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,030
maybe there are just things that we

00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:11,220
should do but anybody can do them yeah

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:18,310
well the point of having them that's

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:20,320
well that's in the lab because there are

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:24,120
basically things I'd like to keep an eye

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,120
on and make sure that things progress

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:36,079
clearly in terms of time of priority

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:39,019
what's there about teams I'm going to do

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,850
try to do that before working on HTML

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,850
version of the packaging tutorial just

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,550
in I mean I actually do help with the

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,490
trademark but from from disparate

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:08,269
perspective if if you had asked hey I

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:11,449
need someone to do DPL work that's a big

00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:13,670
and scary thing but you asked is there

00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:16,399
someone to help with trademark and

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:19,870
that's a clearly defined sub problem and

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:23,899
I thought yes I'm able to do this so

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:26,959
it's maybe even a little bit in the same

00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:30,079
direction DPL helper stalks are big and

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:33,350
scary and clearly defined problems of

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,629
domain X are not as scary if you are

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,879
somewhat familiar or happy with that

00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:40,939
particular problem domain so maybe

00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,009
that's one of the approaches to to

00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:44,389
better define the problems and simply

00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:47,389
put him out there these are the things

00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:49,970
which are currently open and they may

00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:53,809
not even be DPL helper tasks they may

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,790
just be Debian tasks which no one

00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,930
actually does at the moment because if I

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,259
understand I understood you correctly

00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:02,930
you mala said it needs to be done so you

00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:09,519
just pulled the task to you to because

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:12,769
somebody has to do so yeah I've tried to

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,569
describe tasks well not really that was

00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:17,319
that I would to keep it short but in a

00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:19,579
quite actionable way so that people

00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:22,220
understand what they would be supposed

00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:27,529
to do is I agreed to do something one

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:29,720
problem with that so is that from my

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:34,680
point of view while this takes a lot of

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:39,390
time riffing teams related and actually

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:42,450
this is not the most fun things to do

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:45,360
doing a mix of this is more interesting

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:47,520
from my perspectives and well finding

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,339
people to do all of that and then get

00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:55,709
stuck with with myself

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:58,830
so and Susana probably other two to

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:01,290
split into quite large amount of work

00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,810
that needs to could be transferred

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,450
because individually individually it's

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:12,120
quite easy but then sending a call for

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:15,750
help on DDA for that that's then well

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,089
wait for people to volunteer so sending

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,680
a call for help and on the other end

00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:21,690
sending a call for help for someone

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,620
responsible for people in delegations

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,140
for the next six months that's a bit

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:34,740
quite strange as well might not work I'm

00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:36,360
sure we'd get volunteers for that yeah

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,150
so I think an important point here is

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,740
that on one hand they're all of the DPL

00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,330
is something people look up to no see

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,040
there's a cool thing you do we already

00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,930
the representative of the Debian project

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,670
and so on and so forth but on the other

00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:51,810
hand is also a kind of a dumping ground

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:53,580
where we we as developers push stuff

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,140
which is not funny to do and which is

00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,390
not in something we would like to work

00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,400
on and in some way is fine actually

00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,050
that's part of the constitutional

00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,450
definition and EPA rights is some sort

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,309
of decision garbage collection and in

00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,620
the only decision because it's also some

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:10,140
sort of action item garbage collection

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,420
and the important point here I think is

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,610
that in Debian we do ourselves as

00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,650
volunteer a lot of stuff which other

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,110
projects have other way of doing usually

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:22,350
by having some corporate support by

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:24,720
having some paid stuff for this kind of

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,179
stuff so I think here what the steak is

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,460
really are we really able to be

00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,800
sustainable as a project and work on

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,840
this kind of stuff or not if we want to

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,730
be and I think it's truly important to

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,770
be you know independent so if you want

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,570
to be we need some sort of collective

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,640
awareness that this stuff needs to be

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,470
done so there has been in the past de

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,030
piel tasks that took like four years

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,740
five years to complete but there was

00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,480
stuff on which the project was blocked

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,179
on

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,789
so I guess the question is how do we

00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:55,070
make people re alive more often that

00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:57,740
everyone need this kind of stuff to be

00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,870
done and that is just insane to think

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,789
that one person at a time the one who is

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,460
like this DPL can you know reasonably

00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:06,470
make progress on all of them so I think

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,809
the question is okay how do we

00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,820
collectively realize that we need

00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:13,010
progress in this and then how do we

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,809
attract volunteers to work on this I

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,610
think it's not only a matter of okay

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:18,500
it's not funny to work on that sure I

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,299
think it's really trying to make people

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,440
understand that we need focus on on

00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,440
those as a project

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,870
so I'm sorry I missed the beginning of

00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,690
this but what we considered paid

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,580
administration for some tasks I mean has

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,800
anyone thought about how that might work

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,420
how that are their jobs you know again

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,560
it's a question of job divisibility is

00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,260
there a little blob that you could

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,030
actually give to somebody and I guess

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,090
which the same problem as paying paying

00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:59,460
developers tricky in a project with the

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,920
culture like this well if you start

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:06,720
going into that direction the other

00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,820
problem is that you get less diverse who

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,850
could well would be interested in that

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:15,060
work for example I cannot easily give up

00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:17,100
my current position probably well I

00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,410
could try but probably the process of

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,830
giving it up requires at least one year

00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,930
due to French French administration that

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,370
I wasn't suggesting that we paid the DPL

00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,980
I was just that they had a paid

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:32,460
administered sir for PA whatever you

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,800
know that kind of concept yeah and that

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,560
that person stuck around you might get

00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:42,740
some useful continuity out of it I don't

00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,740
it's just it's not very Debian ish but

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,440
it's nonsense and we definitely

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,440
shouldn't do that

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:58,410
my problem with DPL helpers is that we

00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:02,070
see lots of administrative work mainly

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:05,310
so sometimes it's not even much I mean I

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:07,920
could probably spare the time to to go

00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:13,050
and ask the David Evans team what's

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:18,900
going on and report back to you but well

00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:21,930
when I see the DPL I elect him based on

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:26,310
a vision and some direction where I want

00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:28,470
him to steer the project to and well if

00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:33,330
I want to have a DPL I would like to

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:38,510
help him do that and not really so I

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:41,820
mean if you had on your list maybe as

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:44,490
some item like tears the discussion on

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,550
code of conduct or this could be

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:51,550
interesting for me

00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:54,820
but this is not really so maybe you

00:20:51,550 --> 00:21:00,010
should roll in the the list of stuff to

00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:01,540
do because even if it means some of the

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,740
administrative stuff will not be done

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,030
right now

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,310
it means at least you have the

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,200
opportunity to attract people within

00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:12,850
your team to help you do some

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:17,350
interesting stuff yeah I think that we

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:20,290
are kind of well during the elections

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:22,600
actually we kind of forget that what

00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,830
most of the DPL does is not so

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,510
interesting tasks and that needs to be

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:32,290
or she needs to demonstrate an ability

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:33,910
to work on that kind of things or so and

00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,220
we don't evaluate that actually doing

00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:39,070
the peer elections and that's really

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,530
broken we might end up with someone was

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,820
a great vision for the project but

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:48,220
totally sucks at doing that kind of

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,920
boring daily stuff and that would be

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,650
really really amp of armful for Debian

00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:57,040
well oh I see that is that this is

00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,420
basically if I let's say for some reason

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,710
I might

00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:04,720
I could not dedicate as much time as I

00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,840
currently do to Debian suddenly the

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,940
things that I really need to do is most

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,390
of those things that well not all of

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,130
them are really that important but some

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,030
of them are very important and I still

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,490
need to do that

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:23,140
if at any if I need to prioritize I

00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:25,770
don't think that being a DPL giving lots

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,940
of great ideas about the project and

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:31,180
pushing a vision without doing the

00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,400
actual work be and it would be seen as

00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:38,350
something positive by the rest of the

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:41,140
project so I just wanted to get the

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,060
interesting part so you have to delegate

00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,420
the interesting part so actually I get

00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:48,130
interesting parts that's that's why I'm

00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:52,540
interested in delegating this so I can

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:55,430
do some of interesting park but but if I

00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:59,210
just wanted to clarify also that

00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:02,480
well in Debian I think that some people

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:05,540
are great at pushing their own ideas and

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,320
own projects some of them are not so

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:12,890
great at that but still have great ideas

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,140
only the pushing part is the on weak at

00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,330
and I think that it's really important

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:22,030
to clarify that everybody is welcomed to

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:24,620
come to DPLA past meeting and well

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,690
describe where ideas and ask for

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:30,530
feedback and oh should I move forward

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:33,290
with that and I think that having a

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,200
place where you can get feedback on your

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,179
ideas and how to push them to the

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,230
project as a wall that's quite useful

00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:44,870
for for many project members it's not

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,800
really okay that in the beyond if you

00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,600
have a great idea you need to be able to

00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:59,120
be good at pushing it so that's it reach

00:23:50,600 --> 00:24:02,510
completions maybe if you have some kind

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,700
of bug tracker for for those tasks and

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:08,030
even make them release critical in some

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,850
sort of sense maybe just in your bits

00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,910
from DPL just not okay guys these are

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:16,250
still open issues and nobody volunteered

00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,870
this month how about next month how

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,929
about next month's how about next month

00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,220
of course you run the risk of just

00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:24,950
generating noise which it gets ignored

00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:29,000
at a certain point but still this would

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,980
keep up their awareness of hey there's

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,830
too much work to be done and this guy

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:39,410
needs help I think it's a good idea

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:45,950
because well we you could share your

00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:47,630
to-do list on the EDA but but I don't

00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,390
think anyone will grab a need him

00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:54,040
written like that but if you prepare a

00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:54,040
little bit the work in terms of

00:24:54,290 --> 00:25:00,020
what's the next step in this specific

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:02,090
project and if you give a longer

00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,410
introduction about to explain the

00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:06,500
context and everything because not

00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:08,299
everybody will understand what it means

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,919
to talk to an available to new enemy

00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:14,360
website they don't even know if there is

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,040
a new enemy website so I think it's

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,140
would be interesting to have some sort

00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,080
of tracker with a longer explanation and

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:26,390
a next step so even if you don't handle

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:28,970
all the the whole item you can at least

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:32,870
do the first step and it means you have

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:35,270
a log so while if I query unable as an

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:38,660
email I can ask him to respond to the

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:45,710
group what and someone else can pick it

00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:48,429
up later so one issue with that a not

00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:52,460
all issue can be discussed publicly yes

00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:59,740
true but at least some this most of them

00:25:52,460 --> 00:26:02,870
here looks like they would fit probably

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:06,320
yeah public no but not not the next step

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:09,950
for example for some of them next step

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:16,760
is try to get people to agree something

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:20,020
that is a country disagree reaching

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:24,460
consensus is often done sometimes it

00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:33,260
always about people more than about

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:35,780
technical stuff so but it's so that I

00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,370
could try to get to be a bit more

00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,660
verbose about what the current state and

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:46,390
what's the next action yeah but for

00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:49,580
example for Zeus - we have a draft

00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:52,790
well like items

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,850
well list of items for the delegation it

00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:57,919
needs to be rewritten into appropriate

00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:02,000
text and then goes through the team so

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:05,799
the respective teams that can provide

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,799
feedback and iterate on that mean

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:13,740
that cannot that could happen well even

00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:18,030
if you have only the bug report with a

00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:29,280
link to titan pad draft it's still

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:33,720
better than the current status thank you

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:36,300
I was suggesting to have a public to-do

00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,630
list maybe not the whole to release but

00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,100
the same way I said you some some

00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:46,110
items you want to have achieve in the

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:49,740
next month and this is usually one nice

00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:53,670
way of having things done is to do it

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:58,130
yourself it's just so cute on that to

00:27:53,670 --> 00:28:00,060
that hopefully before I read the line

00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,970
right to call for help

00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:08,010
positi item maybe you could just send a

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:12,750
mail very short to the di list and say

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:15,000
well GTI is not having much attention

00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:17,460
and system could one of you prepare a

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,490
bill and send it to Debian devil just a

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:24,830
float and by saying this it's also

00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:28,560
there's also other thing I wanted to say

00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:32,490
DPL help us is a bit scary I wouldn't

00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,500
get into that whole thing I don't want

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:38,850
to attend meetings every week about but

00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,380
if there's some items like having more

00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,600
people in the item is something I could

00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,730
be interested in saying well City item

00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,640
needs more help and I would send a mail

00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:51,180
you know yeah well I could try to push

00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:55,740
more of the work to the 11 teams said

00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:58,470
that 4di problem is too busy so in the

00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,360
past like many people or teams and the

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:04,040
beyond the past the point where they are

00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:06,300
able to ascribe that themselves if

00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,370
people who are overloaded sometimes need

00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,680
someone say hey you you can't do it

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,330
yourself anymore just do ask for her and

00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,260
maybe she just sent is very small about

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,260
it would trigger

00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:23,149
yeah I was just wondering about the

00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:24,559
concert size was been mentioned a few

00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:26,239
times there's there's a difference

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,949
between the kind of the leadership and

00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:31,429
the administration right I mean they're

00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:33,019
quite closely tied and that's makes it

00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:34,369
to be able to separate but you know you

00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:35,719
can be good at administration you could

00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:37,389
be good at leadership and we haven't got

00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:41,989
that many people who are great at both

00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:44,869
and there's a lot of time so could we

00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:49,399
try having the Debian administrator you

00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:51,409
know as well as the DPL it if we made

00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:53,539
another position would that help you

00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:55,489
know kind of visually or is that not

00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:57,109
really because you just spend all your

00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:58,249
time communicating it has to be someone

00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:04,039
you get on with I guess always it

00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:07,489
wouldn't work but it would be

00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,719
interesting so I've always been a bit

00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:11,869
surprised

00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:13,999
no not surprised um I see there's a bit

00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:16,129
of a conflict in DPL elections that we

00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:18,829
are electing someone to be our leader

00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:21,289
but most of what we expect them to do is

00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:22,999
be as an administrator however the

00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:25,099
leader has no teeth without the

00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:27,229
administrative powers would anyone

00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:28,729
listen to someone who just made a lot of

00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:30,079
noise saying we should do these cool

00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:31,399
things we've got some crazy people who

00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:44,479
do that on the lists all the time and we

00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:45,769
ignore them to some degree yes so I'm

00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:47,329
bookie said the authority comes from

00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:51,169
doing all the bollock boring work and

00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:51,889
it's probably true but we but maybe it

00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:53,599
doesn't make sense to split

00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:55,369
administrator from deep from leader

00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,729
because they are totally different

00:30:55,369 --> 00:31:01,969
things

00:30:55,729 --> 00:31:04,099
suited to different people well in such

00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:05,839
a case you have the problem of how to

00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:07,399
determine who's the administrator and

00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,409
how long will he stay D the

00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:13,129
administrator because if this person is

00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:15,469
just like our secretary going on and on

00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:17,479
and on for years to be the defector

00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:21,259
administrator and the defector power

00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:23,989
that be this person that gains more and

00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:25,860
more power both implicit and explicit

00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:31,649
over time

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:33,899
so this may be a real risk as in even if

00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:37,440
this person doesn't even intend to for

00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:38,399
this to happen but still you kind of it

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,210
doesn't feel right

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,210
that's the short version

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,960
so you could deal with that by

00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,760
effectively having the administrator

00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,130
come with the DPL you know you get a

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,800
pair for that period

00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:57,650
I mean continuity is actually useful in

00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,800
administrator so but as you say there is

00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,870
the problem that they'll slowly acquire

00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:06,440
stuff which could become an issue after

00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,850
a while I didn't I guess we press on

00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,920
with this helpless concept for a while

00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:12,560
and see whether we get enough traction

00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,210
in general assistance distributed

00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,060
through everybody which seems a better

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,710
concept if you could make it work and if

00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,330
it's still not working in another year

00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:25,970
or two then I think we have to think

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:27,710
harder about another position yeah we

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,750
have we have had the peer assistance in

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:33,740
the past was second in charge but I'm

00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:40,640
not sure of all the split of powers work

00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:42,500
between them right so was the point that

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,580
we discussed that we forgot that you

00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,830
forgot to mention in beginning was

00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,030
actually that the idea of a DPL Alfa's

00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,730
team was actually to have more

00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:52,160
continuity than a single year and that

00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,390
your comment now made me remember that

00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,550
because indeed the problem with the bare

00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:58,220
assistant is that if they are tied to

00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,590
the same period of one year which is a

00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,990
lot to be short to learn learn how to

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,940
get you around so then you still have

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:08,030
the problem every year you start from

00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:10,070
scratch and with an Ayrshire and common

00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:13,310
mistakes and whatever so that's actually

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:16,490
part of the reason why I need pathetical

00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:20,200
more stable developers team would need

00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:22,940
to be longer than the peer election term

00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:27,080
exactitude with the pl archives about

00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:33,200
always second in charge and the pl

00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:35,570
interactive part yes so the I think the

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,550
the question is how did they work I

00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,260
think yeah the only time I know I

00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:42,110
remember only the last time and I think

00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,030
they both traded leader at the B anuraga

00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:47,030
and they just coordinated via the same

00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:49,270
others I haven't checked the AJ case in

00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,270
the past

00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:21,409
so well you have a whole list of tasks

00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:26,510
how to get out now who is it

00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:29,030
how do you intend to pillage them some

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,520
more in some way some so people can grab

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,590
them not just today where you you could

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,960
shout and say yes it one here this one

00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,750
shot so what I've been doing that during

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,940
the last developers meeting and the one

00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,919
before I think was to publish actually

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,260
actually that to-do list which actually

00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:47,000
is quite a lot of work because rewriting

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:51,050
your to-do list that you write using

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:56,840
more direct what into something that you

00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:59,660
can put in a go be in a gabby document

00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:06,310
it's like at least one hour of work to

00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:09,710
write this down you find the but yeah so

00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:12,350
yeah i'm trying to show DP lappers upon

00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:14,960
once every two weeks and in the future I

00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:17,330
plan to continue to publish that kind of

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,030
to-do list probably a bit more verbose

00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:26,480
and feel free to attend the meetings and

00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:29,119
ask for details but some some items so

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,570
one of the question is in Debian we tend

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,170
not to do ioc meetings that often that's

00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:39,530
not really something that is well really

00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:43,880
common in Debian culture except for some

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:46,220
teams like DEFCON for got him easy to

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,810
block her for you that meetings upon my

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,740
a/c at a specific time and that you have

00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:54,170
to be there if you want to participate

00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:56,750
as we could try to be better at moving

00:35:54,170 --> 00:36:00,920
that well change the time each times

00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:04,840
that everybody can participate or move

00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,840
try to move to main these discussions

00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,610
nobody feels strongly about that

00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,089
well it's not really about problems

00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,740
about iousy it's about holding the

00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:28,230
meetings on my ass yep at a specific

00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:30,000
time of course there is the usual

00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,500
problem that these groups end up self

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,730
selecting and the people you've got here

00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,670
are people who found these meetings

00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:37,800
happened at times it suited them other

00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,480
people might have taken one look at dbl

00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,530
helpers but decided maybe get T PM's

00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:52,980
more interesting because they never got

00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:54,869
involved so just a general comment I

00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,970
feel personally pretty strongly about

00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:59,160
the usefulness of a periodic ERISA

00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,750
meeting especially in this case because

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,280
it's the the place where you have tasks

00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,790
that have been lingering for a long

00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,099
while

00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,920
so having periodically assessment of are

00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:10,560
we doing progress or not is it's pretty

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,310
useful but your mileage may vary of

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,810
course so I agree with that but we could

00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:19,560
do that via email as well

00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:23,190
I send monthly emails to DDA we could

00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:26,849
have the same kind of email sent on a

00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:29,040
regular basis - it would be good to be

00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:35,670
it's better to avoid submitting for that

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:37,290
reason I guess it makes sense to have

00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,990
the RSC meeting because it's just easier

00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:43,530
to sync up quickly but there is no harm

00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:46,200
in having a backup place on email lists

00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:49,260
where you can basically go through

00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,720
issues a little bit earlier and then do

00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,540
the actual more involve discussion in

00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,060
real time maybe it would even be in a

00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,490
possibility to put DPL helpers

00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:02,550
discussions on to Toby well or on the

00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:05,010
Debian private to kind of force people

00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:07,710
to keep seeing those issues popping up

00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,810
so not to move it away to a place where

00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:12,540
only those people who really care and

00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:15,570
who really decided yes this is not scary

00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,420
enough for me to run away see this but

00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,310
so everybody's continually seized okay

00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,440
there is stuff which needs to be done

00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:26,450
this is happening they may need help

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,450
here hey that's something I can do

00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,100
yes I wanted to say there is also the

00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,740
technical committee was doing regular

00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:38,050
meeting in the same way but I revealed

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,210
some difference between both because in

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:43,390
one side there is a team with trying to

00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,680
find solution and which consensus and

00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,290
what's the best way to go forward

00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:50,280
whereas in the DPL pros meeting

00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:53,350
it looks like more you asking each

00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,560
volunteer individually oh how far are

00:38:53,350 --> 00:39:00,970
you and not so much discussion on their

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:03,430
season making a group so while it's

00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:07,000
useful to ping people I don't think it

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:13,240
needs to happen over I see us always at

00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:17,530
least if you move part of the the

00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:20,710
management over to be TSN yeah in the

00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:22,630
back tracking system then you can at

00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:27,850
least also use the owner feature to

00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:30,930
record with working on each entry at

00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:33,910
least some people can help on a specific

00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:42,609
item without subscribing to the all

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:45,540
developers infrastructure that's

00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:48,130
actually a very good point I'm sorry but

00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:51,820
most of the things we did within it

00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:53,320
wasn't a trademark team could be done on

00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,030
the mailing list and it was more or less

00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,580
just reporting back to you what the

00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:01,030
actual status is what we did and what we

00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:03,369
came up with and just pinging you that's

00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,600
the actual status what we did a few days

00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:06,940
earlier when sitting bound that's

00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,020
something which is better suited for IRC

00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,090
where you just have real-time

00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:13,450
communication and the whole team is

00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:15,640
better than just one of the team but all

00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:18,100
the other preparation and especially the

00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,890
this is the status can we do a

00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,750
synchronously and that would probably

00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:25,440
make it easier both for you and for

00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,440
others

00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:48,890
it's someone named well change the topic

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,810
just a question for you for the fun

00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:55,700
would you consider delegating someone to

00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:57,680
steer the discussion concerning the code

00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:00,410
of conduct for example booter i started

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,200
it would you mind giving him some sort

00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:09,829
of official status to try to bring it to

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:12,609
a conclusion good question only can you

00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:17,109
in your ear appear with what he's doing

00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:19,970
can you think of another occurrence of

00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:27,619
someone being delegated to see as a

00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:35,720
discussion doesn't really sound I think

00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:38,660
we need I fear that let's be a way for

00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:42,290
that person to push issues quite

00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:44,480
strongly and doesn't really make sense

00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:49,730
especially for kind of code of conduct

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,800
discussion that's to put a finer point

00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,660
on this if this happens as you said

00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,550
there is the possibility of that person

00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,020
just strong-arming their way into the

00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:59,270
direction which they want instead of

00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:04,790
trying to reach consensus

00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:06,530
I just lost my point oh yeah there would

00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:10,030
be a lot more discussion about hey you

00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:12,770
delegated or many delegated this person

00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:15,290
why not many delegate someone else so

00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:18,740
you would just more if people are aware

00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:20,960
of this this person has this leaning or

00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,540
this type of agenda you would just move

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:27,020
the discussion about who gets to really

00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:29,750
decide and lead well I say dedicated but

00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,970
not formally in the official sense I

00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:36,980
mean just like you try to delegate those

00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:39,369
tasks just about happen in a so that it

00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:43,030
will happen in a framework so that she

00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:45,670
you ensure that some progress made and

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:48,880
you can allow you in hey did you do

00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:51,070
something yeah well one thing that could

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,090
help with the code of conduct discussion

00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:58,330
is find a group of three to four people

00:42:55,090 --> 00:43:02,050
who care about it and would disagree on

00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:05,800
it quite well some aspects of it and ask

00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:07,260
them to push it forward together trying

00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,530
to reach consensus between themselves

00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:15,610
before it gets too much larger mainly

00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:21,880
discussions are difficult to do

00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:24,280
converging that smells of working group

00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,570
which doesn't have to be a bad idea but

00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,120
then you have to make sure that the

00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:30,520
working group keeps and remains open

00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:33,210
because else you would more or less

00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:36,520
exclude the rest of the project from a

00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:39,370
pre selection or pre discussion and then

00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,860
there fat maybe even foregone

00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:44,110
conclusions which will probably get

00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,720
quite a resistance within Debian yeah

00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:49,540
but what if an event happens in Debian

00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,520
is that know everybody has thinks that

00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:55,450
something is quite important but nobody

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,910
cares particularly empowered to walk on

00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:59,980
it and code of conduct for example

00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,620
that's I think that's the case oh that

00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:05,460
was the case for what I'm not sure water

00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:10,300
even feels like

00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:14,200
well I'm sure his motivations working on

00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:17,500
that but it might not be very feeling

00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:23,350
very empowered to work on it himself it

00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:25,630
is pushing it which is great just having

00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:27,370
a more explicit way of saying well

00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,520
thanks for pushing it please please

00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,520
continue

00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:39,940
yes I guess encouraging him is not a

00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:42,550
good is a good idea because I feel it's

00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,380
going to is going to run out of time

00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,570
after that confidence this will not go

00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:50,110
further which is a shame because while

00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:55,840
we make a bit of progress and it would

00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:58,210
be nice to go to the end okay I think we

00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,640
are out of time so thanks a lot for

00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:04,000
attending I will watch the video and

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:08,260
three person minutes was above and which

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,930
I will send to probably probably I will

00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:18,220
provide the link in my next video bits

00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:20,890
yeah yeah oh yeah yes I will post two

00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:27,210
notes there and provide a link to that

00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:27,210
