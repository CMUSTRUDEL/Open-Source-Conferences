could happen and when you registered you

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,110
can you raise your hand if you are local

00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:20,639

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:23,860
your local that you live around here

00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,579
okay that's about half so and if you

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:32,050
consider that you're not very local but

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:34,360
like a few hundred kilometers away yeah

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,440
and very mean if you come from very far

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,120
away the other side of the planet yeah

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,339
