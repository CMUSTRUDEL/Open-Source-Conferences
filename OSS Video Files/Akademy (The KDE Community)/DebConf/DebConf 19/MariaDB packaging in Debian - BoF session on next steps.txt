MariaDB is currently quite stable in Debian and we should have a fairly good opportunity to work on adding new features and capabilities related to MariaDB & co packaging in Debian.

Attend this BoF session and express your needs and wishes, or get to know the current maintainers and get help on how to contribute to MariaDB & tools packaging in Debian.

Room: Sala de Videoconferencia
Scheduled start: 2019-07-23 10:00:00

	00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:12,400
cool Robbie's also online yeah so sorry

00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:17,640
for those who are on the mailing list

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,890
and IRC for the short notice but I see

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,890
some of you came anyway that's great

00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:27,849
and here in the room we have two people

00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:30,730
in the audience and I've prepared some

00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:33,670
slides for those who are not familiar

00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:36,190
with Murray DB what's the current state

00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,210
and I'm gonna go those run those quickly

00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:43,180
through so that you are on the page

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,160
where we are but the four first I would

00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,410
liked a little bit now about these

00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,960
people in the audience here what's your

00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:56,950
interest in packaging and Debian man

00:00:49,960 --> 00:01:00,239
really be I can find you in my approach

00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,239
here so it fits you

00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:29,709
sorry my English so are you

00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:32,319
Debian developers a Debian users are you

00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:39,130
are you database administrators yeah

00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:45,159
do you smell DB developer and sysadmin

00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:46,929
alright cool yeah so the current the

00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,579
overview of the current state here is

00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:54,009
that Buster was recently released and

00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,989
its shipping MIDI be ten point three and

00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:58,569
ten point three is not the latest

00:01:55,989 --> 00:02:00,789
version of melody be ten point four is

00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:03,429
the latest but ten point four was

00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:05,859
released by upstream just a couple of

00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:09,190
months ago so it was too late to have

00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:11,530
that in the Buster release cycle but

00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,690
this week I'm working on it so it should

00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:19,030
go into the new queue and eventually in

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:21,220
unstable hopefully soon and then there

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,760
is MySQL five seven that is maintained

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,340
in unstable but it's not in testing and

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,680
it's not it hasn't been in the in this

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,130
latest stable release buster

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,160
nor in the stretch release before that

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:41,349
and there's a package called MySQL

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,690
defaults which is a which then in Debian

00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:45,970
it points to Marini B and then we Boone

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,019
to who uses the same packages for an

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:52,540
unstable they have their own version of

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:55,690
the MySQL default package which points

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,980
to Oracle MySQL because Ubuntu has

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:04,180
decided they want to use that as their

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:06,579
default MySQL variant and Ubuntu is

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,769
shipping both Murray DB and Oracle MySQL

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:14,260
and Debian is shipping only MariaDB and

00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:16,329
then here's a few links there's a

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,810
maintainer dashboard so there is a team

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,980
called packaged MySQL mayn't and this

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,099
team

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,659
maintains both MySQL animal DB and a few

00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:29,010
packages related to this

00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:31,239
for example the client libraries and

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,280
here you can find the maintainer

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,290
dashboard and then you can find the

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,470
packages overview and now this canvas is

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:41,470
slightly too small so you can't see the

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:45,190
links here but this is the package

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:48,430
overview so this is the package is

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:51,549
currently in development and in Debian

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:58,180
unstable so we have Galera 3 then we

00:03:51,549 --> 00:04:01,500
have already bit 10.1 10.3 and now we

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,879
lost the signal and it came back and

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,190
then there used to be a melody big

00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,650
connector see packaged separately but

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,900
that is now shipped the money big

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,660
libraries are not shipped inside the

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,940
MIDI be 10.3 package so it doesn't have

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,479
a separate source package anymore then

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:22,210
there is my VM backup

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,479
then there's my SQ 5.7 then this mask

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:28,300
your connector C and then the mask you

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,030
defaults package and Percona extra

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,610
backup package in here you can see the

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,669
debian versions all stable stable

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:39,190
testing unstable and what is the version

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:42,460
they are shipping and if there's just a

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,050
- it means that it's not in that where

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,690
it's not shipped in that Debian

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:51,760
distribution at all and then you can

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,280
also see the Ubuntu versions here and

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,490
then some build icons for the build

00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:04,990
statistics and see our results and

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:10,060
upstream versions at the end yeah and

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:12,310
then here's one one new package which

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,900
doesn't fit the canvas but it says here

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:19,210
mara DB connector ODBC so it's the Java

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:23,400
connector and it has been uploaded to

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:29,320
the new queue and it will be an unstable

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:31,719
soon so that's new thing and all of this

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,630
is online and anybody can browse these

00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:36,400
pages and see them update in real time

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,040
to get an overview what is the state of

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:44,290
the packages maintained by by this team

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:47,920
at the moment so this is the kind of

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:54,910
currently currently developed packages

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:56,620
and then we also have the the older

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,830
versions that are still maintained for

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:03,660
example here the old old stable has

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:09,930
merely bit 10.0 and then you stretch

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:13,990
10.1 and in Buster 10.3 and then we have

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:16,210
this is from the packages directory in

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,760
Debian and then on the right side is the

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,830
packages directory in Ubuntu and anak

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,550
there you can see what Mara DB versions

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:26,830
are are in which we want to release this

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,470
and you can copy those links to yourself

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,140
and put there whatever package name you

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:37,360
are interested in to see the specific

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:39,490
details of each package yeah so there's

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,530
quite a lot of work in this team

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:47,350
there's many source packages and their

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:49,810
source packages produce a huge amount of

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,610
binary packages and then it's not just

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:55,180
maintaining those packages but you also

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,280
have the old versions of those packages

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,080
in in different Debian and Ubuntu

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,130
releases that need to have security

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:06,730
updates and then then you have the

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:10,270
parallel parallel releases from upstream

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:12,070
as well so if you're wondering why we

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,290
have ten point one and ten point three

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,480
but no ten point two that was simply a

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,250
decision to skip one version so that

00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,800
would there will be less parallel

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:27,130
maintenance work to do in Debian and

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:29,710
Ubuntu yeah and the state for MySQL is

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,140
that mysql five seven is now in there be

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:36,820
an unstable and there has been some work

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:43,660
into in mysql 8.0 but it has not been

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:45,610
applied uploaded to unstable and who is

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,450
doing the work here is some commit

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:53,040
summaries from the main report

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:55,530
on the left side you can see the MariaDB

00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:00,690
repository my TB server repository

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:04,910
there's one two three four five six

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:07,830
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,800
twelve different people at least most of

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,680
them have done just one commit or one

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,660
patch and then in MySQL there is three

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,200
people and mostly two people

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:23,180
Lars and Robbie doing the maintenance on

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:29,430
that package and Robbie is now online on

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:38,820
IRC at least let's check in on IRC if

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:43,080
there's any comments yeah and I'm doing

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:50,610
the bulk of the work in Moorea DB as you

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:53,490
can see here is the most recent uploads

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:56,190
of each source package so you can see

00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:01,580
when it was done and by who

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:08,340
so it's mostly me and Rene Englehart and

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:10,170
last Tung world who are doing the final

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,390
version that's being uploaded and these

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:17,480
people are kind of carrying the final

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,480
responsibility of what's in the packages

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:28,050
yeah but these are all fairly alive and

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,180
kicking so it's going okay and then

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,610
there's one problem that's annoys me is

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,970
that the mailing list is quite quiet and

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:42,120
most of the traffic or almost half of

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:43,800
the traffic is spam messages and here

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,090
you can see some of the names who are

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,610
discussing on the mailing list it's

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:54,470
cause our sign of activity how how big

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,470
the team is or how small the team is

00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:02,010
right and here's the chart for bugs in

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,630
multi B 10.1

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,370
so I can't show you all the charts

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,950
because there are so many source

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,620
packages but in general the state of the

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:14,730
box is pretty stable and it's pretty

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,760
good and here you can see a huge or not

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,400
a huge but significant drop that

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:25,500
happened during last DEP conf a year ago

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,390
and since this is for 10.1 when 10.3 was

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,400
introduced most of the bugs were

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,370
reassigned for 10.3 because they are

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:36,330
apply for the latest version but some

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:39,900
some are stuck on 10.1 and most of these

00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,030
bugs that are still open are not serious

00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,940
they are minor ones and actually quite

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:49,730
many of them are difficult or impossible

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:52,590
to reproduce reproduce or they are vague

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,890
so if you want to help with packaging

00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:58,500
the simplest thing to do is read these

00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:03,090
bugs and then research them and try to

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:05,010
reproduce them and find some ways find

00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,810
some more information on these bugs and

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,000
then we can either just close the bugs

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:12,510
if we realize that it's not relevant or

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,370
it's not a real bug or then get some

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:18,300
more insight what's going on is and

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:22,110
hopefully so within Debian or get the it

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,720
upstream to solve it and just you think

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,280
that Debian bug system is just about

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,820
sending email so you don't need any

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:32,250
coding skills you just need regular

00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:36,360
sysadmin skills to research what's going

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:38,610
on and and you know maybe use virtual

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:44,700
machines or docker images to try to

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:47,100
reproduce the problems described is the

00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,200
question on this so you're both

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:54,680
reporting you would very much like

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:57,000
people to triage some of the bugs and

00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,870
big pick one see if they can reproduce

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,700
it document the bug better so that you

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,500
guys could pick up the bug with a

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:10,650
cleaver if I do this for look like this

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,850
yeah so exactly that's something any

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,069
user anybody not

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,809
committing could do the more people

00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:19,989
doing that the better the quality of

00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:22,539
Berea DB I asked you well yes thank you

00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:29,189
for refreshing it clearly this is

00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:32,639
something anybody can help but yeah so

00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:35,249
please join so the easiest way asset is

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:39,459
participating in the bog discussions and

00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:41,350
if you get that far that you actually do

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,809
some coding and packaging then please

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,609
open a merge request themselves up we

00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:48,129
have a very good CI system that will

00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:51,339
automatically run for all merge requests

00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:53,859
that will help help a lot

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,739
because it's a huge package and there's

00:12:53,859 --> 00:13:02,319
lots of up cred and other scenarios so

00:12:56,739 --> 00:13:04,869
we are scared of regressions and of

00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:07,089
course if you're doing something that is

00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:09,220
not Debian specific then hopefully you

00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,829
would contribute directly upstream and

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,589
upstream has very good instructions on

00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:16,389
how to contribute an upstream has for

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:18,639
example two times a week they haven't

00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,799
have chat session so you can go and ask

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,569
if you're new comer to the codebase you

00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:27,789
can go and ask for mentorship then you

00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:31,329
can join the IRC channel there's

00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:38,049
currently eight people idling and then

00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:39,970
you can join the mailing list and for

00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:42,339
this both session I was thinking that

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,039
the outcome would hopefully be new

00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:47,589
comments on existing bugs or people

00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:51,999
filing new bugs either for actual bugs

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:58,869
or feature requests as as tickets and

00:13:51,999 --> 00:14:05,609
bug tracking system alright and I have

00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:05,609
here goby to write notes and then I have

00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:11,249
the IRC open here

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:18,130
and does Robbie have something to bring

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:27,730
forward about the current state that is

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:31,029
important and relevant a robe is

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,670
commenting on the spam issue that as

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:35,170
long as it's listed as the package

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,370
maintainer we are not allowed to

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,370
moderate it for spam

00:14:47,270 --> 00:15:11,390
right any questions anybody on IRC with

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:13,959
questions all right so let's start with

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,370
discussing problems and after that

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:20,560
planning for the future this does

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:24,100
anybody have any major problems with

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,690
mariadb or MySQL in Debian at the moment

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:34,600
something they want to get more

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:34,600
attention for is it working well for you

00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:19,490
using my pain our inference telecom we

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:25,920
are preferred because ins is very fast

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:30,230
very stable which Debian release are you

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,230
using in your infrastructure stretch

00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:44,810
booster stretch more

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:47,580
have you had any upgrade problems yeah

00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,890
it's a it's kind of a nightmare for

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,360
upgrades because you have a

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:54,920
configuration files and then you have

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,800
the database files which need to be

00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:02,010
carried over from upgrade to upgrade and

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:05,939
the database file obviously you don't

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:08,730
want it to be destroyed or anything or

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,350
and or have the end user end up in a

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,329
situation that they can't access their

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,610
binary files or something like that and

00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:17,790
then the configuration changes little

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,120
bit from major upstream releases to the

00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:27,480
next and you might have issues with all

00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:33,830
configurations that stopped working you

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:36,540
would like to but that's are being

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,970
reported we just do not ever to be

00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:42,510
produced them I would like to see them

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:46,679
being attacked for more information i

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:48,900
guess that is something that other users

00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,110
in the community can pick up the tags

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:55,410
for more information try and triage them

00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,910
could reproduce them but if if they are

00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,830
not

00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:02,380
reproduced after a period of time just

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:06,550
just close them as unable to reproduce

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:09,010
I completely agree myself I actually

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:12,430
don't use either of these packages but I

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:16,360
am I am very much aware of the bug

00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:17,650
triage process and yes you otherwise if

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,810
you don't do it you end up with bugs

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:22,150
hanging around for years and years and

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:26,350
years and they're probably not even a

00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:28,810
real bug yep I think maybe a third or

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,940
half of the bugs are tagged more info at

00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:33,430
the moment and many of them are quite

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,900
all so we should probably start closing

00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,900
those by now

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,750
yeah well this is pretty good situation

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,390
that I want to discuss problems and we

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,100
ended up with discussing that we should

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:27,220
just start closing bugs because there

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:27,220
are no problems let's write some notes

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,710
can you make the text bigger

00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:59,770
yeah so we are tracking also the bugs in

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,900
Ubuntu because Ubuntu basically just

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:04,780
sinks the packages from Debian and

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,920
whatever bugs appear in the bun - are

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,500
likely to also affect Debian so we are

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,500
tracking the pack bugs in both

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
distributions

00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,700
have you already already been upgrading

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,170
from stretch to Buster some machines

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:07,350
have you already upgraded from Debian

00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:10,580
stretch the Debian Buster some machines

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,580
have you tested it

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:37,400
how many machines yeah five five

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,360
machines yeah

00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,360
all right a little bit

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:59,890
yeah if we look at the bugs for 10.3

00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:06,169
then there is no spike at the time

00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:08,409
Buster was released so that's a good

00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:08,409
sign

00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:26,459
yeah probies writing that users swapping

00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:33,690
between mysqldb are still getting their

00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:35,279
systems broken and we do have a plan to

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:40,200
make that better but it hasn't been

00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:43,349
implemented yet yeah so there's a very

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,919
old and slightly stupid system that when

00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:50,249
MySQL upgrades it will just add a file

00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,989
called Debian and then something version

00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:53,669
number and dot flag in the data

00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:56,549
directory and that will be used by

00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:58,950
maintainer scripts to detect what

00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:01,049
versions you have and if you're trying

00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:05,039
to downgrade which is not possible

00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:06,989
anywhere then the dev console just fail

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:11,609
and you will end up with the system

00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:13,619
where dpkg is kind of broken because the

00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:19,309
maintainer scripts just exit and that's

00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:19,309
stupid and there is an issue for that

00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:27,979
let's see if I can find it quickly

00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,590
yes this is the bug

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:55,950
all right how about feature requests is

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:57,720
there something you would like to see so

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,690
there was obviously some people who

00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:05,340
wanted to have the Java connector in

00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:09,179
Debian repositories proper and that's no

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:16,140
now going on and we have Galera and we

00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:19,980
have the client libraries and I'm pretty

00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:22,800
satisfied with the scope of packages we

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,170
have and I haven't heard people request

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,490
a larger scope people usually just

00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,760
request that they want to have the

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,860
latest version and regarding shipping

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,860
the latest version in our current CI

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:38,070
system we automatically build for

00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:41,010
unstable but also for the back port for

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:45,390
the stable so it will be pretty easy

00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:51,030
it's just a matter of of a pretty small

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:58,500
task to to to submit whatever is in

00:25:51,030 --> 00:26:01,170
unstable back ports in the future I will

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,530
probably do that when I get ten point

00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:10,380
four into unstable that I will start

00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:14,330
back porting it to Buster and maybe some

00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,330
other versions as well

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:28,119
as people on IRC have any feature

00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:28,119
requests

00:26:42,140 --> 00:27:01,309
how about the audience what would you

00:26:45,890 --> 00:27:06,559
like the package to do I have some

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:11,840
problems and the best future are using

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:19,690
no Jason Collins the objection columns

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:32,269
yeah it's waiting new feature are using

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:35,870
these yes so Jason columns was mentioned

00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:38,960
as something people like and

00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,960
[Music]

00:27:52,570 --> 00:28:03,220
and as a side note I just wanted to show

00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:06,440
that we are we are shaping as much of as

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:09,890
possible from what upstream produces so

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:14,390
we have lots of plugins as you can see

00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:16,220
here in 10.3 rocks DB is a new plugin so

00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,299
it's a new storage engine you can use

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,299
and we are shipping it now

00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,779
I'm not aware of any upstream

00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:44,039
functionality or feature that exists

00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:46,169
that people would be asking so I think

00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:50,399
we have in Debian everything that's

00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:54,929
relevant for almost all users there

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:58,049
exists a few storage engines that we are

00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:59,850
not shipping like Cassandra but I

00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:02,119
haven't heard any future requests about

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,119
it

00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:23,139
and Lunas commenting on IRC that it

00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:23,139
doesn't have feature requests and it

00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:29,710
works great for his use case

00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:50,679
does anybody else have something they

00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:50,679
wanna race or discuss

00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:02,380
so next thing you can pick out your

00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:05,809
laptop and start browsing on the bugs

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:20,320
and maybe comment something on the bugs

00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:20,320
I will also have a talk later today on

00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:30,180
on how meridia be uses salsa CI I

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:36,900
recommend you come and check it out it's

00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,900
pretty extensive

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,290
arrogance it

00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,490
in

00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:45,309
yeah

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:45,309
I apologize for misgendering Luna

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,400
Clement just arrived do you have any
