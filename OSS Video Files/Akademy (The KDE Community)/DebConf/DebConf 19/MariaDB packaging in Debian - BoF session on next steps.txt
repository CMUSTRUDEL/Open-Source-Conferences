MariaDB is currently quite stable in Debian and we should have a fairly good opportunity to work on adding new features and capabilities related to MariaDB & co packaging in Debian.

Attend this BoF session and express your needs and wishes, or get to know the current maintainers and get help on how to contribute to MariaDB & tools packaging in Debian.
