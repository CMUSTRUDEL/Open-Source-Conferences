Debian Cloud Team is there for over 3 years. Our main goal is to maintain official Debian images for the cloud and some cloud-related packages. During this period we have achieved many improvements but we still have a lot of work to do and things to discuss.

Cloud environment changes rapidly which does not always fit Debian release model. In order to cope with some of these changes and better support our users in cloud environments, we've been lately changing the team structure and some processes. We're getting more formalized, taking more responsibilities and cooperating more with SPI.

We'd like to present to the wider public what we already did and our current and next steps,
and what we have in store for the Buster release! We'd also like to collect feedback from the Debian community as it is really important and should help us in making decisions for the future of Debian in the Cloud.

hello everyone I'm Tomas this is Lucas

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,670
and this Archer we are all members of

00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:17,970
debian cult team we will need to sign we

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:22,230
will need we will want to present what

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:26,070
we are doing and how how our team is

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:29,370
organized what we are working on what

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:35,879
are our projects also what are our

00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:37,079
problems and plans for the future so our

00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,269
intention

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,149
according to Debian social contract is

00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:44,640
to provide debian to to users wherever

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,460
they are now more and more people are

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,530
moving into the clouds they are using

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,219
not only computers on personal computers

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,649
or computers on premise but also but

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,420
also they are using remote computers and

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,739
computers in the cloud so as Debian was

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,170
most moving through technologies

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:08,340
providing ability to run Debian from

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:12,270
floppies from cities on also on flash

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,430
and network installing now now we want

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,530
also to provide the same quality of

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,009
Debian to the cloud the biggest problem

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,159
with the cloud is that you cannot just

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,750
run Installer on the cloud because most

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,860
of the cloud environments expect that

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:32,810
you as a user have already installed and

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,719
configured image so it's a bit more like

00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,520
something in between live image and

00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:41,189
hibernated image that was that was

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,829
snapshot at and then is ready to run on

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:46,979
one or 1000 machines so so that's our

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,810
biggest challenge and we need to end we

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,990
need to provide Debian in self

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,969
environment

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,030
ok so I'll talk about the scope of this

00:01:53,969 --> 00:02:00,240
talk so this is introduction so will

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:04,229
give you an overview we will not go deep

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,810
in into technical details if you want to

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,060
discuss more stuff go deep into these

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,870
details you should try to attend our

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,420
buff on Monday 1330

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,720
so you can check the schedule but in

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,630
general we are open for discussion

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,320
stocke we would try to get feedback from

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:26,150
you and we are always welcoming new

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,250
members because we have a lot of stuff

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:34,160
to do and usually we don't have enough

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:36,980
people to do everything that we want so

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,840
as I as I mentioned we want to

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,020
understand your usage in general as

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,480
Debian users we want to know if you are

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,880
using that in the cloud if you're not

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,880
using why because we want to improve our

00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,580
work we also want to understand where

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,830
you are using the Debian in the cloud so

00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:59,360
you are using public clouds if you are

00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:02,480
using private clouds how you view your

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,200
images you are using the image that our

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:10,700
team provides so the image that the type

00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,980
including built and butan if you are

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,709
using your custom images if you are

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,480
using our own tooling the Debian cloud

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,980
sync tooling or if you have your own

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,459
scripts we want to understand the

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,739
current status and to improve our work

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,600
in general so if you are if you think

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,820
that we need to add some specific stuff

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,170
if you are already our user in things

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,920
that you need some specific steps to

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:38,000
those image please you can interrupt me

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:46,370
whenever you want and give us some

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,380
feedback so about our team so we as the

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,440
other teams we have some members most of

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:55,610
us are already Debian developers we have

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,280
some delegates so since October last

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:01,130
year look at Phillip Ozzy who

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,980
unfortunately is not here he's one of

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,709
our delegates we have Steve McIntyre one

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:11,660
other delegates and we have too much so

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:14,930
they represent our team and we also work

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:18,229
very closely with some cloud providers

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:21,049
so there we have some employees that

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:24,110
they are also Debian contributors so we

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:26,630
are working closely to make Debian those

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,470
Devon cloud image run better in those

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:32,080
environments

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:35,039
we also are working with SBI to manage

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,270
our accounts on those called providers

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:39,360
the cloud providers that we are working

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:45,250
on right working with right now is

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:49,389
Google cloud AWS and Microsoft Azure

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:55,509
so we SPI help us with this legalised

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:57,729
stuff and all these things ok if you

00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,949
want to contact us in general so as you

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,960
can see we want a lot of feedback that's

00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:03,819
why we are here so we have a mailing

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,159
list you can subscribe to that mailing

00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:09,669
list it's called its name Debian cloud

00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:13,330
in least 11 dot org we have our RSC

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:17,380
channel it's Debian cloud in oft C

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,469
server we host most of the work our work

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:24,940
in Tulsa so there is also a cloud sync

00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:27,159
group we have our wiki page with a lot

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,460
of information there so you'll find

00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:32,740
details about our images some ideas if

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:36,520
you want to use our images in public

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:41,400
clouds how we build those images if you

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,560
want to build your own image images so

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,080
so if you want to check our work in

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,370
general the wiki is a good place to

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,620
check and most of the work that we've

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,770
been doing are done doing Deb cons and

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,620
our sprints in general so in this week

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,919
page there is a report of our last

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,169
sprint and so you'll find what we are

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:08,050
working on and all this stuff so please

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:14,560
if you want to contact us check one of

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:18,340
these yeah so we are quite young team

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:23,219
this is history how we were growing how

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:25,810
we were progressing through time it's

00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:28,889
probably not full image

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:33,090
I might forgot some things it's the

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:35,319
result of discussions and getting common

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,960
common view from different people if I

00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,789
forgot some someone or some important

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,740
event excuse me totally my fault

00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,889
basically in 2013

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,349
we we had initial discussions at that

00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:50,319
point in Navarre Marcus James from

00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:53,319
Barker started so informal discussions

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,270
there he he contacted or he got

00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,710
contacted also by some people who were

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,090
already using cloud or who were

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:03,449
interested at a similar time jimmy

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,690
couple of its who was at that time

00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:10,330
employee of Google was also starting

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:13,120
working on providing Debian images for

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:16,240
that cloud and shortly after we started

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,789
working on a script to building to build

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,789
images initially as I mentioned for

00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:25,270
Amazon for AWS and for Google and then

00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:28,960
during for the next two years and also

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:32,650
at Def Con scene haider in important in

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,750
heidelberg we were discussing we were we

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:38,440
were working on some more scripts to

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:41,620
build and to build those images we were

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,590
trying to get common common features I

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,710
will mention this later when we were

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:50,530
talking about our tools but basically we

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:53,050
were trying to get our scripts to to

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:56,020
have common common criteria common

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:59,770
ground and not so all the clouds use

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:03,729
totally different totally different set

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:07,330
of Tours and totally different set up in

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:10,419
2016 so at Cape Town we had even more

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:13,120
discussions and we we gathered enough

00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:15,599
people too so it made sense to organize

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,719
for Sprint's we organized the sprint in

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:22,389
Seattle and since then we were

00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:27,969
organizing our sprints regularly we were

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:30,610
discussing for about about idea of the

00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:35,589
team about tooling about setup and so on

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:38,740
in 2000 after one of the Sprint's our

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:41,110
last sprint we our team got delegated

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:44,339
because we decided it's a good time and

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:49,900
it's it's good idea to to have it

00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:51,790
formally set up and in 2019 again as a

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,670
result of discussions during one of the

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,510
sprints

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:59,720
we we worked with SPI to create official

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:02,060
tagging accounts in the clouds managed

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:09,260
by SPI we've taught a legal protection

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:11,750
and so on okay so so you know you

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:18,920
already know about the history of our

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:21,650
tea and as you can see we a new team so

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,870
we are not we have you know five six

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,460
years working on this colored stuff and

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:30,560
but what we do as a team so what are our

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:33,290
responsibilities our main goal is you

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,000
provide official dev image to run the

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,660
clouds those different clouds public

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,330
cloud private cloud and to do that we

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:46,220
maintain some related cloud related

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:48,590
packages such as cloud need some agents

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,500
running on some specific cloud providers

00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:54,620
but not all of them such as photo with

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:59,540
its which the Python package to interact

00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,760
with AWS and so we try to maintain of

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,400
all of these related cloud related

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,140
packages we also are responsible to

00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,570
manage Leben accounts with cloud

00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:16,550
providers with the help of SBI Saarinen

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:19,460
and now we are trying to start working

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,260
on some on debian package mirrors on

00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,150
those cloud providers because there is

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,780
an important requirement for them so

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,700
we're starting to maintain those mirrors

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,770
because it will reduce the cost of the

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,530
traffic so you don't need to get out of

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,690
outside of the cloud to fetch some

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,120
packages will reduce the latest in

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:41,210
general some user case some use case you

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,190
will need to use v PCs and you don't

00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:47,600
want to access stuff outside of the

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:49,190
cloud so we are starting to work with to

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,820
implement those Debian package mirrors

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:58,060
in those public cloud providers

00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,730
and okay so as I said the main goal is

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,220
to provide those stable Debian images

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:07,110
for cloud providers so that's the main

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:10,630
goal but we also want to test things

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,820
before we release them so we're also

00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,670
provide some testing images that's not

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,930
official but they are available in some

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,810
cloud providers they are not available

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,750
in the marketplaces so you as a user

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,779
will not be able to find those testing

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,520
images in the marketplace but if you

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:31,380
check our wiki page you will find some

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,150
IDs and you be able to test them as well

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,730
something that is under discussion is

00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:39,760
that we want to build some variants of

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:44,440
those images so we just built a Debian

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:47,560
stable images using main Debian name and

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,140
we are thinking it's under discussion so

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:55,990
we want to get some feedback from you as

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:57,400
well so sometimes to make use of the

00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,440
harder that we have in those cloud

00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,150
providers we need some non free software

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,959
for instance when you are working with

00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:07,839
eight HPC so you need to enable to run

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,110
some stuff on GPUs you need to install

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,089
some drivers and they are usually not

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,339
free so we are thinking about to provide

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,980
some normal facial images with those

00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:21,610
drivers to make the life of our users

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:26,440
easier so it's under discussion if you

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:28,390
have any feedback or if you want to make

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,459
any comments you should reach out to us

00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:36,040
and discuss we also want to know if you

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:38,800
think that it's easy to add new language

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,720
and locales in our images by the fall if

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,290
you think that we need to add some

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,070
additional shaft software so yeah we

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,900
want feedback as you can see so you can

00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,730
start thinking about and in the end you

00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:57,850
can make some questions and suggestions

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:59,980
for us and those emails those official

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,160
images so those are Debian stable image

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,829
they are built by Debian by telling

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,940
people in Debian hardware and they are

00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:11,790
available in a double

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:17,800
as Google compute engine in OpenStack so

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:20,200
that where we are right now and now when

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,440
to now all those images are published in

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:27,850
different accounts managed by different

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,890
peoples so I think yes basically as I

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,620
mentioned in this slide about our

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,990
history different people coming from

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,120
different companies were creating

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,600
accounts and were create what creating

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,890
providing images and usually it it was

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,840
left at as is but it was getting more

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,820
and more complex to manage this account

00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,340
especially as we also need to create

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,440
user accounts for some Debian developers

00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,170
to be able to upload those images to

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,140
register them to test to try building

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,840
new variants as Lucas mentioned so

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,410
during recent sprint we decided it's

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,650
time to to become more professional and

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:12,040
to and to create official Debian

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:14,880
accounts managed by SPI with full legal

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:20,320
responsibilities and similar

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:22,480
requirements of cult providers so we now

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,980
we are in the process of creating those

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,830
accounts currently as for today Debian

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:32,620
has the process of creating official

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:35,910
Debian images are done for Microsoft

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:39,310
Azure and for Google cloud cloud engine

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:42,430
on Amazon it's not yet finish there are

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:45,730
still some big discussions between SPI

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:49,030
and Amazon I'm not sure what they start

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:52,990
was there but we are in the process and

00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:55,000
so we hope to get to get past the

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:59,830
release already on official Debian

00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,200
account it work in 2/3 so 66% of success

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,100
is not stupid

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,170
it's still not not yet fully finished on

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,290
on Amazon as I mentioned but we are

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:14,980
getting slowly getting there in the

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:16,990
future we will also think about using

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,130
those accounts to provide access for

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,230
Debian developers to

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,650
who need to run something in the crowd

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,470
but it's yet for now it's in the face of

00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,300
plans we first want to finish the ascent

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,990
because it means that we will also need

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:37,420
to integrate those clouds cloud accounts

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:40,340
and cloud identity with our LDAP which

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,990
there is no standard way of doing this

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,090
across on other clouds so here we need

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,570
to do this separately for each of the

00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:50,450
cloud providers but we are moving there

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:53,330
slowly yeah so we are working to unify

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,310
those Debbie knockout so we're building

00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:58,130
our own tooling to manage all these

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:02,030
things so he'll SBI is helping us as

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,740
Thomas said so this official accounts

00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,170
will be great because we will be in

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,210
those marketplace as Debian level

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,460
project not some random Debian

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,820
contributor so we will have more

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,370
visibility on those marketplaces we have

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,160
some stable names an identifier so it

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:21,740
will be easier for our users in general

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,850
so that would be great will help us

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:32,090
technical side and also this marketplace

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:35,030
stuff and all this things now talking

00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,880
about our tooling so what do we use to

00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:41,060
build out those images for now we are

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:44,870
using f8i it's the our main tool to

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,850
build those images we have wisdom some

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,860
we have migrated phones bootstrap

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,430
basically initially we were using a

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,800
different tool for four different clouds

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:57,860
I'm not sure what was at the very

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,710
beginning use for Amazon but we're very

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:03,500
quickly we moved to booster visit for

00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,260
Google Jimmy use his own scripts then we

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,740
also integrated this into bootstrap busy

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:12,290
it was quite good tool written in Python

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,010
extensible but quickly it became a

00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:18,530
little bit too complex especially as we

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,510
were thinking about moving providing

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,750
different variants and providing and

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,390
adding new new cloud provider and new

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:30,330
target meant that we had to write too

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:35,309
much code which was not easily Charlotte

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:37,830
in between between those targets so

00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:40,169
after some discussions at one of the

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:44,519
sprints in Seattle we went through

00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:46,429
different different different solutions

00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,720
we were discussing whether we want to

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:50,610
rewrite something whether we want to

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,179
write something from the scratch but

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:58,470
finally we decided to to use a fiii with

00:17:54,179 --> 00:18:01,440
a great help of Thomas Wonka so it's

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:05,429
really good and it's really easy to add

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:10,200
new currently to add new variants to to

00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:13,519
use these to to extend these to to to

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,710
make it better work with the our cloud

00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,330
environment so we are quite happy that

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:22,889
that we are moving in this direction

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:28,700
it's still not finished but we are very

00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:32,010
very far far away very far ahead so

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,019
Thomas said FAI is easier to exchange

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,960
whether it's just extra stuff you to

00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:39,600
customize things so for the OpenStack

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,789
image we are still using a customized

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,549
script called build OpenStack Debian

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:48,240
image so we are planning we're trying to

00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:50,880
move to fai until the boots I release we

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,830
are working on that right now we still

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,850
have two years two more years so yeah so

00:18:52,830 --> 00:19:01,590
we have we have plenty of time

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:05,399
we also host all of our git repositories

00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:09,210
in salsa we are also making use of the

00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:11,039
salsa CI we build in our own workflow

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,220
workflow to beutel's image we're

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,289
planning to test those images and

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,539
automatically publish them the cloud

00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,789
protein those cloud providers and I

00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:25,169
don't know the future make it available

00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:26,909
in the marketplace as well we show you

00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:28,580
make use of this those efficient

00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:30,899
accounts that I mentioned before

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,179
basically now we are publishing in

00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:35,580
offshore accounts but it still requires

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:39,299
few manual steps especially for running

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:42,270
tests and for approving publishing of

00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:43,059
those image we we want to move this

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,159
tumor out

00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,220
attic process but first we want to make

00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:50,499
sure that we are building this we need

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:54,789
we need more testing we need more floral

00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:59,320
testing we will talk a bit about it in

00:19:54,789 --> 00:20:02,110
few more slides okay and now we are

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,440
developing a new tool for our team it's

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,659
an image finder so we are building many

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,629
images and we want to make the life of

00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:12,399
our user our users easier to find them

00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:16,960
and this is a google Summer of Code

00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:18,759
project and r2 is working on this

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,869
project and he talked a little bit about

00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,299
his birth yeah

00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:24,220
hello everyone my name is Artur so I

00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:26,169
will show more about the image finder we

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:30,279
have been developing for the cloud and

00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:33,279
for all users and basically we have this

00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,710
image of finder and we'll have viewers

00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:38,710
that you can search these images for

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:42,519
Debian with types providers

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:46,929
architectures also we have RSS feed that

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:49,899
you can look for new images and an API

00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:53,619
that you can update are like images and

00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:56,320
providers and yeah that's basically the

00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:58,299
what we've been developing now and the

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,879
next steps we are going to do is to

00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:04,450
integrate is image of file into the

00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:07,809
cloud to the Debian infrastructure and

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:15,879
I'll show a quick demo about what we've

00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:18,159
been doing let's try to do that so and

00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:20,110
this first page you have a bunch of

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,529
providers and this providers you can

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:25,840
select one and you will redirect the

00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:27,610
user to the next page and this next page

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,179
you have a quick description about that

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,470
provider and how to run that image and

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:35,289
also in the bottom of the page you have

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:38,440
all the images for that provider and you

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:41,700
can filter and so yeah that's the first

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,700
page and the next page

00:21:51,030 --> 00:22:03,850
okay this one it's a okay this one will

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:08,130
have a general filter that you can go to

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,130
the top of the page and do the search

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:29,760
okay I opened there the wrong file

00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:29,760
sorry sorry some technical problems

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,509
okay now now you okay this is one we'll

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,340
have a general Twitter for these images

00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:57,399
so they use you go to the top of the

00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:00,610
page and do the search and will redirect

00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:03,460
the user to another page and this second

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:07,450
page it will be possible to filter all

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:10,240
that images with release architecture

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,399
and coop provide you and also you can

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,039
click on one of these images and we'll

00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:16,899
groupid redirect you to another page in

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,809
which you'll have more details about

00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:28,210
that image yeah that's my project thank

00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:30,249
you yeah so basically if somebody is

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,929
using convey one cloud it's easy to find

00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:33,970
all images in this one cloud on the

00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:37,389
other hand if somebody for various

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:40,779
reasons like redundancy or security or

00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:43,539
something wants to use a various clouds

00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:45,850
and wants to host Debian on those

00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:49,960
different clouds he or she can always

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:52,509
get all relevant images with the same

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,470
Debian version for different clouds and

00:23:52,509 --> 00:24:00,070
and the user will be able to find all

00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:02,860
those images and then integrate those in

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:05,259
in their own workflow and in their own

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:16,090
scripts or some automation or whatever

00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:21,299
tools they are using yeah so that we are

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:21,299
on other projects and other tests so

00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:27,700
we've been working with some people in

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,519
the team are working on this trying to

00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,799
test our images so we are trying to most

00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,409
smoke test our image is trying to boot

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,549
them try to check the network try to

00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:42,399
check the partitions and the packages

00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:45,700
that are installed and all this stuff so

00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:49,330
we are working on this testing framework

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:52,929
and try to integrate in our salsa CI

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:56,470
pipeline because we want to improve our

00:24:52,929 --> 00:25:00,490
image in general increase the quality we

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:05,980
also have been working cloud kernel back

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:08,350
let's optimize it for the clouds so we

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:11,320
disabled some stuff that is not needed

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,600
in a cloud environment and we enabled

00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,390
some drivers needed by some cloud

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,250
providers so this package is smaller so

00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:22,500
we can build smaller images we can put

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:25,840
them faster so we have been working this

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,920
kernel cloud kernel package we also have

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:34,030
our own group setup so it's different

00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:36,610
for the regular desktop group setup and

00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:39,070
specifically we we the cloud providers

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,500
and their custom customers are very

00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,600
interested in secure boot because in

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,610
general they want to make sure they they

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,230
are booting that imaging there is no

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:52,720
malicious code there and so some members

00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:57,520
of the cloud team are also working Lee

00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:00,310
and EFI Debian team and working on

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:06,610
secure boot and finally we have it in

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:09,400
this bus release so good news for us and

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:12,520
another project that some people are

00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:15,370
interested in our team is to push some

00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:18,820
OpenStack image automatically to some

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:21,220
OpenStack providers some private clouds

00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,200
general so some people are trying to

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,630
find a way we may use I don't know we

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,970
may use the image file on that image

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:31,470
find that twist working on we have an

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:34,600
RSS feed we can try to some way out

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:38,730
automate and when we have a new image

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:42,640
publish we can push it to those

00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:44,260
OpenStack instances so something that we

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,690
need to discuss so those are some

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:51,210
interest projects if you have some idea

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:55,050
or what we need to do to make it better

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,050
feedbacks welcome

00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:07,770
so as I mentioned both of our works done

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:11,580
during Sprint's so they are milestones

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:16,700
for our team in general they usually

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:21,390
happen autumn and till now

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:23,640
we host this Sprint's in Seattle because

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,920
and but next sprint we're planning to

00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:30,600
change stuff and maybe it will being at

00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,280
MIT student planning phase but when you

00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,410
have something more consolidated we will

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,690
have a wiki page and if you want to join

00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:41,340
us there and work with us and join our

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:43,890
team you will be welcome so you should

00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:47,850
have that soon and we are in Seattle

00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:50,130
because there we have offices of the

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:55,470
three big providers that we are working

00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:58,320
with so Google cloud AWS and Microsoft

00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:02,250
Azure so that that's why we are in

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,080
Seattle in general and those things are

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,540
very important because face to face in a

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,200
face-to-face meeting we can do a lot of

00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:13,620
stuff we can go forward with some

00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:17,580
discussions and get a lot of things down

00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:21,060
in general so that's important for us so

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:26,490
if you want to join our team Sprint's

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:30,930
are a good way to start working one of

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:32,550
those three and of course we have in

00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:36,180
general some problems when you're

00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:39,330
talking Debian and cloud because general

00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:43,830
Debian we want stability we don't want

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:46,350
to too cheap and you release

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:50,100
upstream stable point releases in

00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:53,610
general because we can introduce more

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:56,100
regressions so the timeline of this

00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,700
cloud providers in general are totally

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,750
different from ours they want they are

00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,690
changing their software's

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:06,510
all the time they are adding new regions

00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,090
new features they want to deploy them as

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,270
soon as

00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:11,800
possible and those kind of things are

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:15,990
important for the user experience

00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:18,550
generally we don't need all of them we

00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:21,280
usually you can use some old stuff and

00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:25,360
it will work but to improve the user

00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:30,430
experience we need to update all these

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,900
things and yeah so it's hard to it's a

00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,680
trade-off we need to find the right

00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:37,570
balance between this stability that we

00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,100
we want in Debian and this quick

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,230
changing software that we have in these

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,360
cloud providers and some is a problem

00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:49,690
that we are facing and we want to find a

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:51,930
solution so though most of those skull

00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:56,650
providers they run agents inside those

00:29:51,930 --> 00:30:01,210
images those agents are not always the

00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:04,480
FSG compliant so you will there so if

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,670
not they are not suited for main so we

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,120
can put them in our official Debian

00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:13,810
image and that's not good for our user

00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:19,210
for the user experience so that's we

00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:21,910
need to find a way to to to work that

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:23,830
out and for it

00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:27,850
we have an exception for instance the

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:30,460
Google Cloud agent we have it in me it's

00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,920
a viable it's the the FSG compliant but

00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,950
I think we have some it applies a tough

00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,390
that's yeah so basically there are again

00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,120
differences between different cloud

00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:43,240
providers so for Google agent is really

00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,220
vital for running images for Amazon for

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:50,110
example it's not necessary because

00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:54,220
images work but they work only one user

00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:57,040
can SSH into into this particular image

00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,080
and we don't for example have detailed

00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,750
performance counters of running

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,480
instances because then Amazon can only

00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,940
check state of instance from outside and

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,320
not from the inside and for security

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:13,150
reasons some agents are able to run

00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,680
particular set of commands which are

00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:19,149
already predefined

00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:21,519
not requiring to SSH into this machine

00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:23,889
which greatly increases security but

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,950
this again requires yet another agent

00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:31,330
which had really strange license and we

00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:34,029
were not able to do two packages but as

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,580
Lucas mentioned that's why it's

00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:38,379
important to to go to talk with the cult

00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,839
providers to have those prints because

00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:43,119
then we can talk to them and they can

00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:45,669
fix something from the corporate site

00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:48,039
and they can provide they can change

00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:50,200
soft some software or or extract some of

00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,809
some of those functionalities so we can

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,509
use it and we can safely package them in

00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:58,539
Debian yeah so I think this is one of

00:31:55,509 --> 00:32:01,059
the biggest problem that we have so they

00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:04,269
are changing face in general we are not

00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:06,690
because we want stability so we have

00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:09,129
some discussions about the volatile

00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,999
repository before so I don't know if

00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:15,690
that is a good solution for us because

00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:19,570
with that we'll be able to provide those

00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:21,549
updates fat in the fast pace and so

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,549
something that is under discussion and

00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:26,529
you want to listen you in general if you

00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:33,309
have an idea how to help us to solve

00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:35,889
those kind of problems and yeah so as I

00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:38,979
mentioned I we didn't talk about too

00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:40,690
much about technical details so if you

00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:43,929
want to do that you should attend our

00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:47,169
above Monday and thanks for your

00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:49,539
presence for your attention and I hope

00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:52,259
you have some feedback for us and if you

00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:55,630
want to make a comment or ask a question

00:32:52,259 --> 00:33:04,219
now it's the time so thank you

00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:04,219
[Applause]

00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:15,640
you know we have some questions

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:21,550
is it working so I just want to put some

00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:23,940
straight on your history you said we had

00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:27,820
the first script in 2016

00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:36,660
though there are open stack images since

00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:40,120
Jesse and that's 2015 earlier then the

00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:49,150
testing images for OpenStack I believe

00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:50,860
they are official and and one last thing

00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:55,810
and I hope we have the time to discuss

00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:59,410
it during the buff so we do have the an

00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:03,660
SPI account for the three big cloud

00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:07,420
providers if you are to upload images on

00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:09,970
OpenStack big clouds then we also need

00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,930
to figure out how to do that it somehow

00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:19,750
SPI will need to have an account there

00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:26,920
probably we need to to think about cloud

00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:29,110
provider agreement we need to push two

00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,460
feet to discuss how we want to push two

00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:39,250
OpenStack providers all right thank you

00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:42,670
thank you for the talk I was wondering

00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:45,310
how do you deal with security issues the

00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:48,150
original raid the images every time

00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:53,680
there is a DSA or how do you do it so

00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:56,440
basically we we rebuilt and we provide

00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,250
we publish new images after every dot

00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:02,770
release of Debian and we also have

00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:05,260
please correct me if this is wrong but

00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:09,310
we at least we were discussing having

00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:12,410
unattended updates and enabled them

00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:15,800
so that's part of the answer we also

00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:18,320
specifically every time there is an

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,840
update to a package that matters in our

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,120
images we generate new images so

00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:26,000
literally I'm watching build process

00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,300
right now going today on new OpenStack

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,700
images for Buster and stretch for the

00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,830
latest around the kernel updates

00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,960
obviously for longer running cloud

00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,880
images it's a good thing that we get

00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,980
security updates but lots of people

00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,290
wanted to be secure immediately from the

00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:46,010
point it starts up so we do we generate

00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:48,230
regularly as technical details this is

00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,690
somehow sometimes problematic because

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,810
for example on Amazon when you upload

00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:57,230
new images then you IDs of those images

00:35:53,810 --> 00:36:00,170
change because you have am i - ABCD one

00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:06,890
two three four and then after updating

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:10,130
you get am i - e f g four five six so it

00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:12,350
means that people need to update updates

00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,580
in their scripts and change their

00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,050
configuration for example in

00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,600
auto-scaling groups or something like

00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:21,230
this that that's why we we also want to

00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:24,680
have this RSS feed in image finder so so

00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:31,850
they can automatically get yeah get

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:36,710
information about those outlets can the

00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:41,420
images be verified with open PGP you

00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:44,060
mean signing they are signed I guess

00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:52,940
they could we could we would need to we

00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:57,380
would need to I shouldn't have sat down

00:36:52,940 --> 00:37:00,980
so it depends on the context some of the

00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:02,960
platform provided images it depends very

00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,970
much on the api's and whatever and the

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,850
how you find the images and how to

00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:10,010
verify that way for example for the

00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:13,520
OpenStack images that we publish

00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:15,560
directly all of the everything is

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,260
checked summed and they're all signed

00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,970
with our fit with our keys so yes you

00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:26,810
can check with PGP

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:30,890
and then there's an SSH sha-512 that is

00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:34,850
published on the Debian website that you

00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:38,140
can verify with PGP and then on the

00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:40,820
OpenStack cloud provider the same harsh

00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:45,890
appears England's so you can check for

00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:49,960
it definitely we're talking about

00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:51,260
OpenStack at the moment for the other

00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,330
platforms

00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:56,420
it is very platform specific as to

00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:59,060
exactly how you get to this we want to

00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,420
have official images for all of the

00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:04,340
platforms available so you can download

00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:06,080
form Debian infrastructure too but

00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,060
depending on the platform Mac and then

00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,350
make it awkward to use those images it's

00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:15,320
it's a difficult story yeah one last

00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:17,570
thing so you can check for the checksum

00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,070
in OpenStack though of course you still

00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:21,620
need to trust your service cloud

00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:24,800
provider because he could let's say

00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:26,570
rewrite Glens to cheat on that though if

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,730
you have this kind of worries just don't

00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:34,100
use that provider in your message so

00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:36,860
there is another technical details for

00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:39,350
example when you upload image for when

00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:41,390
you download your image from Debian and

00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,480
want to upload this for example for

00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,920
Amazon then you get different ID

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,140
depending on the region and depending on

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,550
some date of time of Solaris so it might

00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:55,820
be hard to do totally verify this so as

00:38:52,550 --> 00:39:01,070
Steve and Thomas said this totally

00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:03,320
depends on the cloud provider but at the

00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:06,050
same time it's important that we have

00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,030
those official accounts so we we know

00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:13,370
who has access to those accounts who can

00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:15,200
publish these and then you can't be say

00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:18,770
me sure that this is only taken people

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,200
who build images on Debian hardware and

00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:24,230
then uploaded this to the cloud and then

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,850
we are then we need to trust this cloud

00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:29,780
provider that they didn't change

00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:31,280
anything nasty like this has been

00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,950
something that has been ongoing for a

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,950
number of years to make sure that people

00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:39,260
we in no way are we suggesting any of

00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,390
any of the cloud platforms have been

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:44,240
doing bad things well it can be

00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:46,640
genuinely difficult to find an official

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,010
Debian image in some cases and we want

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,350
to make sure for the safety of our users

00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:54,830
and for and for free software Whedon's

00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:57,380
that what is lit described as a Debian

00:39:54,830 --> 00:40:03,109
image is a will there be an image and so

00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:04,850
we all want to make this work well and

00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,830
yet it helps to make sure that we don't

00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,990
thought mistakes here as well and you

00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:14,630
actually get a genuine thing yeah it's

00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:17,000
good okay are there any more questions

00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:20,530
we still have few minutes or are you

00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,530
getting hungry and waiting for lunch

00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:27,730
okay then thank you very much thanks for

00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:27,730
coming

00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:35,130
