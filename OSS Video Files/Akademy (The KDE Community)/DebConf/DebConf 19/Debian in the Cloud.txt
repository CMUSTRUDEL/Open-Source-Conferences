Debian Cloud Team is there for over 3 years. Our main goal is to maintain official Debian images for the cloud and some cloud-related packages. During this period we have achieved many improvements but we still have a lot of work to do and things to discuss.

Cloud environment changes rapidly which does not always fit Debian release model. In order to cope with some of these changes and better support our users in cloud environments, we've been lately changing the team structure and some processes. We're getting more formalized, taking more responsibilities and cooperating more with SPI.

We'd like to present to the wider public what we already did and our current and next steps,
and what we have in store for the Buster release! We'd also like to collect feedback from the Debian community as it is really important and should help us in making decisions for the future of Debian in the Cloud.
