good morning everyone and welcome to the

00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:17,950
second day of our dev comp 19 please

00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:26,290
receive and give big applause to some 2%

00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:29,800
beets from the Debian project leader hi

00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,989
there everyone so you know I I guess

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,430
it's really an honor or no it certainly

00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:36,250
is really an honor to be standing here

00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,200
before everyone Debian is a really

00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,480
wonderful community and to have the

00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,360
privilege to work with you all to

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,460
facilitate moving this community forward

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,860
and helping under other people around

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,540
the world understand how awesome we are

00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:55,210
is something that I'm that I'm deeply

00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,390
moved to be able to do and I'm really

00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,370
enjoying it for the most part so I'd

00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,250
like to start out by you know thinking a

00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,799
number of people who I think have made

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:12,460
this this event and Debbie impossible

00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:15,220
I'd like to first of all thank the the

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,110
tea the local team here and the entire

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,340
DEFCON theme all around the world the

00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,450
people who have actually put on this

00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:24,670
conference also I'd like to thank our

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:31,590
sponsors and Fubini AK Google and Lenovo

00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:35,320
and all the rest and I would like to

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,450
what is this doing um okay and I would

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,299
also like to thank all the contributors

00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:43,659
around the world who've made that be

00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:48,790
impossible we wouldn't have an operating

00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:50,020
system or a community without you so you

00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,140
know this is a point where we normally

00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:58,290
look at what's happened in our community

00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,290
since the last last year and

00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:13,160
okay right of course I wasn't here last

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,510
year I was actually off busy doing

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,690
something else that kind of got in the

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,480
way of me being able to afford the time

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,130
and money to make it to Deb conf but I

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,000
didn't manage to bring Debbie into my

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:30,440
wedding

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:33,200
both in terms of the kilt and also you

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,060
know of course if you're gonna run sound

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,320
for a wedding you need hardware to do it

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,120
on and of course if you're going to have

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,530
an operating system for that there's

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:50,510
really only one choice so but moving on

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:53,750
oh okay um is this a buster slide okay

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,130
great sorry um so there has been a lot

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,470
that's happened in the last year we

00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,000
released Buster and I'll admit thank you

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,410
to the release team and everyone for

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,840
making that happen when I submitted the

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,730
talk proposal for this you know I assume

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,260
we probably would have but it would be

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,150
kind of a little awkward to be out here

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,380
with a session talking about how great

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,840
Buster was when we were sitting there in

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,570
the last week's of the freeze um but

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,910
Buster is a truly amazing release it's

00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:20,209
bigger and better than ever more source

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:23,329
packages we've done some really amazing

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:25,040
things on the security front secure boot

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,660
we finally got working which is

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,180
something that we've needed for a while

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,549
and that is an essential part of being

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,890
able to meet users needs in the current

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:35,209
world but we've also started making some

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,070
really important strides towards

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,049
actually securing the applications on

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,750
the system at the system level with app

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,670
armor and of course Buster does contain

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,470
things like flat pack and snap that you

00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,480
know attempt to provide that sort of

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:53,060
isolation for user containers as well

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,890
and I think we've really managed to hit

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,350
a good balance in our release schedules

00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,260
between you know we took 25 months from

00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,720
stretch to Buster

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,370
that's long enough that if you're really

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,510
interested in latest software towards

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,250
the end of that you're sitting there

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,890
going stretch is really kind of long in

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,859
the tooth and yet it's short enough that

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,930
if you're really interested in a stable

00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:16,070
long-term system you're very glad we

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,930
offer LTS

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,360
and that stretch is supported for a

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:25,840
while after Buster is released and so I

00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:38,350
think we've hit a stride so in the

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:44,750
another thing I'm sorry sorry about that

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:47,980
so in the past we've had the donations

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,900
of HPE that have helped us out in

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:54,890
meeting our equipment needs and moving

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,000
forward with what in getting and getting

00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,740
us the infrastructure we need to host

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,890
debian and we're a little bit worried

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,620
coming into the last year or so because

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,950
that it was unlikely to happen in the

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,530
future

00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:11,570
um but through the generous donations of

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,970
handshake and another sponsor and

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,800
everyone who's continuing to support we

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,860
found that we're actually in a very good

00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,570
financial status situation for me the

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,640
moral is that we have a great community

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,890
of people who care about Debian and if

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,770
we come to them with a real need they

00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:33,140
will come and meet our needs and so we

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:35,060
move forward so I've already actually

00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,310
managed to do something as DPL which is

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,310
kind of cool during the campaign I said

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,770
I would go work on three discussions and

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,630
try and drive them forward and we

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,670
managed to have a discussion where we

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,080
all got together and talked about what

00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,960
our needs were in terms of recommending

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,480
d/h to get a bit more uniformity about

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,940
across the archive in terms of packaging

00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,720
and we succeeded in doing that

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,580
um and I'm really amazed to say that not

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,170
only we succeeded in doing that we even

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,670
succeeded in Gaudin getting it into

00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,030
policy and I really like to thank the

00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,790
policy editors for that we will probably

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,230
be getting it into lynchin pretty soon

00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,700
that's blocked on me writing up some

00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,760
information that the luncheon maintainer

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:22,400
have requested um so that's really

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:24,919
exciting so one of the things that sort

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,810
of came out of the d-h discussion and a

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,190
couple of other things is that the

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,400
maintainer z'

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,110
um you know we've been evaluating the

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,000
balance between our maintained errs

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,950
maintainers are our strength there's no

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,570
way we could accomplish debian without

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,120
giving people individual power I mean

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,280
can you imagine if we all try to argue

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,350
about each of the 30,000 source packages

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,500
it would be insane we would get nothing

00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:50,120
done and so the maintainer 'he's really

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,680
are the fact that we delegate

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,900
responsibility in so many different ways

00:06:51,680 --> 00:07:01,430
is one of the huge strengths of the

00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:04,850
project unfortunately unfortunately it's

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,990
something that we are struggling with a

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,870
bit because there are some weaknesses

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,340
and we're finding that you know making

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,920
changes across the project you're

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,590
dealing with coordination issues have

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,830
always been a touchy point have always

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,410
been something that's hard to get right

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,770
and I think we're suffering from that a

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,260
fair bit both emotionally and

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,460
technically and this d/h decision is one

00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,880
of the first times we've really

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:35,120
revisited that and looked at basically

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,160
saying hey we as a project are gonna go

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,440
evaluate something and we're going to

00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,260
make a decision that not all the

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,610
maintainer x' disagree with and that's

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:48,830
going to affect some of the maintainer

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:51,530
x' um and i think as we go forward we're

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,480
going to have to reevaluate that balance

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,300
and continue to figure out we clearly

00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,360
need a strong maintainer model um but

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,480
perhaps not entirely as strong as we've

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,770
had in the past and i think one of the

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,110
things going forward is to figure out

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:10,650
how exactly that works

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,970
so another thing I've been working on is

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:16,510
the anti harassment team in our process

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,910
around conduct in the project earlier in

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,280
the year we had some discussions that we

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,650
deferred because we were busy talking

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,540
about a specific issue and a lot of

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,070
people brought up the point that we

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,160
really didn't want to be having a

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,840
discussion of how to handle the general

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,160
case when we were in the middle of

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,480
discussing a very specific case and

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,010
there was sort of a proposal to defer

00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,570
that until February or so we actually

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,840
deferred it a lot longer than that I

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,250
think that was pretty good but I think

00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,670
it is really important that we have

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:51,400
decided to come back to that because I

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,780
think that there are people who had some

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,420
real issues that they wanted us to

00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,430
consider and in order to create a

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,460
community of respect we actually have to

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,830
listen to the people when they do have

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,200
concerns and think about them and look

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,920
to address them so I spent basically the

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,480
month of June working on this problem

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,230
collecting a lot of feedback listening

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,210
to people and a whole bunch of talking

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,310
and reading years worth the DPL archives

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:22,210
about many of the conflicts we've had

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,740
and right now we're in the middle of a

00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,540
discussion where the project is talking

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,190
about what it wants from this process I

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,160
think very soon

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,630
quite possibly this afternoon we're

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,750
going to hear from the team about what

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:38,250
they propose to deliver and then we can

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,250
reconcile that and see where we are

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,320
so one of the things that has really

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,150
come to me has been obvious but um

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,110
incredibly obvious to me is that this is

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:53,350
an amazing community amazing product and

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,150
we have a lot going for us and the DPL

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,160
position gives you visibility into that

00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:00,910
is it's been a real pleasure and I want

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,220
to share some of that with you one of

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,900
the thing is that I've that is that has

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,590
helped me in approaching Debian and

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,720
actually really all of life is that

00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,370
to pay attention to the things that are

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,930
great about a situation to pay attention

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,970
to things that make you happy um and

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,890
things that you know you that your

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,610
gratitude giving it and receiving

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:27,190
and then to process the things that

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,080
aren't as happy the problems the area is

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,350
where we have to improve that's that's

00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,320
an important part of growing as well but

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:39,220
don't let it get you down

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,840
so another thing that I'd like to us to

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,820
look at is everyone here has probably

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,860
had an experience of someone in this

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:50,050
community who's helped you out and who's

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,670
basically reminded you how we are a

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,070
strong community and how we can't depend

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,750
on each other I'd like to call these

00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:00,040
Debian heroes and I think we all have

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:02,470
some and we all run across them in in

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,120
our work I like us to get in the habit

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,550
of telling people that they are our

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,650
heroes when that's true so that we can

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,060
all remember that we do make this better

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,910
so I'd like to take a moment to talk

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:16,030
about a couple of my heroes the first

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,770
one is someone who I was sitting there

00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,980
and I was working on some software and

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:22,660
it didn't work for some songs that I put

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,060
into it it seemed to be dependent on the

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,670
file name and it was a regression from

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,370
scratch to Buster and it was very deep

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,200
in a bunch of code and if I encoded the

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,760
file name directly it was fine but if I

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,430
used as a variable reference it wasn't

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,530
and I filed the bug with the test case

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,720
and I'm like I bet I'm never gonna see

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,700
this bug fixed you know it was just one

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,220
of those really obscure hard upstream

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,290
things that you sit there huh is anyone

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,030
ever going to get to this and the

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,450
maintainer filed it upstream passed

00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:55,140
along my test case and within a week

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:58,750
there was a cherry picked a patch to UM

00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:01,120
to fix it now like wait you mean when I

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,070
file a bug is a user I can actually get

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,600
my problem fixed even if I don't

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,250
understand how to do it myself

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,680
I mean yeah that's what we say on paper

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:12,760
but it's really wonderful to see times

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,860
when that happens so my first hero is

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,410
Felipe Saylor and I apologize for

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,630
butchering people's names um who

00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,340
reminded me that you know yes

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,870
our users and said we're all users

00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,190
matter

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:29,080
the second hero is well someone who's

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,850
tirelessly made Debian work for me and

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,910
you know part of a team the

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,800
accessibility team in particular um and

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,060
you know one person but this has been

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,740
someone who's really been there for me

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,750
when I've run into trouble and um I

00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,370
don't work on accessibility stuff in

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,140
Debian it's just I'm more interested in

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:51,040
the security and stuff like that

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,780
and I'd do it if I had to but it's

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,090
really cool that I can go upgrade from

00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,130
stretch to Buster and the only thing

00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,130
that really got my way was timidity 8 my

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,500
sound but once that was fixed basically

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:06,190
it just worked and it kept on talking

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,290
and I that's a lot of people who are

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:12,730
responsible want but one of the ones who

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:15,580
really matters to me is Samuel to vault

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:21,700
and you know for his wonderful work on

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:25,000
Debian accessibility so during my

00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:28,690
campaign I talked about you know how I

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,030
wanted to approach kind of working on

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,600
healing and growing and making decisions

00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:41,340
and my goal in Debian is to empower us

00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:45,820
and work through using techniques that I

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:50,350
can try out and if they work we can all

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:52,420
learn and we can all practice that you

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,690
know know this isn't this is something

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,610
that maybe I have some good skill at but

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:00,310
it's something where we can all practice

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,590
and learn new things and get better at

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:07,470
making decisions at treating each other

00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:09,900
with respect and compassion and at

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:13,630
solving even the difficult problems

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:18,850
where we grow rather than hurt from the

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:21,040
experience so I wanted to go over a

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,460
couple of the things that I've been

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,740
working on to accomplish that but first

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,960
and I think people have kind of picked

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,610
up on this is how I've been trying to

00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,310
approach technical discussions and and

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,350
basically what I try and do there is

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,730
find a facilitator you know and in once

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,279
where I'm leading it it will be

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,990
me um here's gonna sort of drive the

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,449
discussion and try and be fairly neutral

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:47,740
um but you know ask some questions and

00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:51,639
look at where the consensus is emerging

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,180
and then follow up on that and see what

00:14:51,639 --> 00:15:01,089
happens

00:14:52,180 --> 00:15:02,380
um and then um you and then um but

00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:04,269
what's really important to make this

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,100
happen is to towards the end

00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,829
issue a consensus call this is what I

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,320
think we said this is what I think we

00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:13,779
got this is where we have disagreement

00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,339
this is where we have agreement and this

00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,040
is where we weren't able to decide and

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:20,050
then see if that sticks because if you

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,660
publish a consensus call saying hey I'm

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,550
pretty sure that we um we agree that

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,600
we're going to switch to rpm by both I

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,459
um

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,930
that you'd get pretty quick feedback

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,449
that perhaps you've gotten something a

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:35,199
little bit wrong and you would be very

00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:38,649
clear that um you you know where you

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:49,269
perhaps didn't quite understand the

00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:51,399
community so on the emotional side again

00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:53,470
and again what I'm I'm really seeing is

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,810
that we can make better progress if

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,850
people feel heard if people feel like

00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:01,930
the points that matter to them were

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,970
considered by the project um and so I

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,500
think one of the most important things

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,750
in approaching emotional discussions is

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,220
to try and take the time to interact

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,920
with people who disagree with you pretty

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:15,459
strongly whose positions you wouldn't

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,440
normally um you know spend as much time

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,839
on and make sure that you understand

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,490
those positions well enough that you can

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,500
explain them back to the person who

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,829
holds it and have them say yeah you got

00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,050
it

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:28,600
that doesn't mean you're agreeing it

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,069
doesn't mean that you're you're going to

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,290
decide that just because you understand

00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:36,010
something we're gonna do it but it does

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,779
mean that the people out there feel that

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,850
they're part of a community that you're

00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,980
worth there that they are worth your

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,430
time to understand

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,830
of course to actually drive change we

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:54,230
need to combine the emotional and the

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:58,850
technical we need to be able to approach

00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:00,350
a discussion and know know where we're

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,880
making progress and if we're not gonna

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,830
make progress basically if there isn't

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:08,480
enough agreement in the community stop

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:09,740
wasting time on it because discussions

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,589
that drag on forever

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,300
drive away people and you aren't going

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,850
to get an informed consensus if you

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,970
basically you know discuss and discuss

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:22,430
and discuss and tell the people until

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,959
only one person is left yeah maybe you

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,670
be it will be done and maybe no one will

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,930
disagree that doesn't mean you actually

00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:32,710
got an informed consensus of the people

00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:37,150
who were in at the beginning and then

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:39,980
but people who do disagree need to feel

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,500
that the process is fair and part of

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,360
fairness is knowing is believing that

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,040
the bodies are respected that the body

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,920
is thinking about these discussions have

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,630
the respect necessary to do it so you

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,100
know having bodies like the policy

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,560
editors like the project as a whole

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,720
looking at these things that the project

00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,180
believes in is an important part of it

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,700
and then letting people know what they

00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,290
do if would need to do if they get to

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,830
the end and they're like yeah I'm sorry

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:08,690
I think you guys still got it wrong um

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,340
not being afraid to tell people that you

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:14,630
look if you really still think this is

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:19,190
wrong file a chiona or bring it to

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:21,650
another people or you know find some

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,380
additional people who'd be willing to

00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:26,270
listen but be honest about how big of a

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,370
showing that you know you need to

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,370
actually make progress you know if one

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,570
person is is unhappy and you know most

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,180
of the other people in the discussion

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,010
are happy say well yeah you can file a

00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,790
gr and if you really feel the need to do

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:42,860
so then absolutely do that but be aware

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,840
that currently that doesn't look like

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,470
you're going to get 50% of the project

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,470
to support you

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:58,539
another very important part of learning

00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:01,330
to grow and to and to move forward is to

00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:03,940
making mistakes we don't try and make

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,549
mistakes but we all do and we all will

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:11,139
and I've been practicing that this week

00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:12,970
not intentionally but it happens um for

00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:16,899
background for those heart developers

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,940
there was I wanted to try and make some

00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:21,909
changes to better align some stuff with

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,739
what I thought the project needed and I

00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:28,289
was prepared to take a lot of heat on

00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:31,179
that but I was actually surprised that

00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:35,619
in one of the ways that the project

00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:39,639
disagreed with me and um it became clear

00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:43,259
that that the project actually had some

00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:45,429
better ideas on how to go forward so

00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,320
yeah we're all going to make mistakes

00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:49,659
but the thing is that when we do make

00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:54,009
mistakes it hurts the people around us

00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:57,399
and it hurts us so there's a real need

00:19:54,009 --> 00:20:01,090
to you know try and do your best but

00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:03,159
we're all going to have issues where

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,700
that you know doesn't come out where we

00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:08,919
are surprised or where even though we

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,629
try and do our best that things don't

00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,029
work out that way and we are going to

00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:15,909
hurt each other and what we can do then

00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:18,210
is work on healing each other and work

00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:20,999
on honoring that that pain is part of

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,799
taking the risks necessary to be amazing

00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:27,340
but and I'll tell you like coming here

00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:29,619
was pretty challenging um you know I was

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:35,139
worried about approaching the conference

00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:37,059
and you know feeling attacked by

00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:39,539
everyone but that's not actually what

00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:42,100
happened um

00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,509
what did happen is that there were some

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,210
people who really did disagree but some

00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:48,999
of what I was doing but almost all of

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,690
them were constructive almost all of

00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:55,119
them wanted to try and make debian

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,769
better in their own way and understood I

00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,990
was trying to do that but disagreed

00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:02,549
pretty strongly

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:06,950
and what I found is that we have a

00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:09,890
really really amazing community where

00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:12,480
those people were willing to show me

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,220
better ways of doing things and by the

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,159
time I got done basically I found a way

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,460
of accomplishing my goals that respected

00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,380
other parts of the project and that are

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,110
actually gonna be easier to talk about

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,220
the kind of things I was trying to do

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:29,250
thinking about it the way that other

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,490
people proposed and so if you're able to

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,260
listen to that feedback you get

00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,360
basically this community is here to help

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:40,850
you out and it's I'm really touched that

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,850
I have such wonderful community

00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:58,649
so kind of moving on to a lighter topic

00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:59,879
um I wanted to talk about now that we

00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:01,169
have this you know we've agreed we have

00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:04,950
this awesome community what do we do

00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:07,049
with it so one of the things I hear

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,539
sometimes is that you know it's us

00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:12,809
versus the upstreams

00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:15,179
that we're getting forced into things by

00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:17,190
things that the upstreams are doing i'm

00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,869
Collies confused by that because debian

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,940
matters and basically a lot of people

00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:22,980
know that outside of this room too um

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,049
there's a huge chunk of the web that

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,539
runs on Debian there are a lot of people

00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:31,999
who do understand the importance of

00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:35,119
stable software and they work on and

00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:38,070
they understand when we go to them that

00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,889
the issues of distributions matter

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,769
that's not true of everyone um but it is

00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:44,399
true of a huge huge portion of our

00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:46,409
upstreams

00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:48,440
and there are many places where if we go

00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:52,200
approach the upstream respectfully and

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,119
talk about how Debian has these needs

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,799
and we'd like to work with them and meet

00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,159
our needs and understand their needs and

00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:02,669
meet their needs too we could change the

00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:10,919
upstreams that's especially true if you

00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:12,450
go look and you find that like you look

00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,529
at the list of Debian developers and you

00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,070
look at the upstream contributors like

00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:18,419
huh wait but the main upstream different

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,399
contributors happen to be Debian

00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,840
developers of course we can interact

00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,409
with that community and we should

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,899
remember that and remember that actually

00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:30,600
we are an important part of the world

00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:32,399
and that doesn't mean we should you know

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,429
arrogantly demand things but it does

00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:38,059
mean that we can come and respectfully

00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:43,259
interact from a position of strength

00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:45,509
so Debian has some really great things

00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:49,529
going on we have this amazing collection

00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:52,559
of software I mean who else has 30,000

00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:55,409
source packages of you know vetted

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:59,159
software that actually meets the DFS GE

00:23:55,409 --> 00:24:00,480
that that someone has looked at working

00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,570
you know making sure they all work

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,660
together

00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:07,480
that's something no one else has

00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:10,510
who else has you know we also have a

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,580
wonderful it's sometimes maybe it's hard

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,070
to use but we do have a bug process that

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,960
allows people to interact with us in one

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,360
way no matter what part of our software

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,540
they're using uh we do have stable

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,230
releases if you go look at people who

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,940
are who care about you know running us

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,650
consistent set of software over a long

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,370
period of time one there are a lot of

00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,800
people who do care about that and to

00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:42,940
Debian is one of the big big players in

00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:47,110
that space but we also have some

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:49,270
weaknesses um in order to get something

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,500
into Debian you need one of us to look

00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,620
at it it doesn't have to be a developer

00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,270
it can be a maintainer can even not be a

00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,670
DM if they're willing to get it

00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,530
sponsored but ultimately for a new

00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:04,270
package to enter the system a Debian

00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:07,690
developer needs to interact with it and

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:10,630
for packages to continue to be work in

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:15,820
the system a DM needs to work with it

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:17,740
not that means you know Debian can only

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,090
grow so fast and unfortunately there are

00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,740
a lot of people writing free software

00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,460
out there and we can't keep up with all

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,870
of them so it's great that we have that

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,050
the FSU that's one of the biggest

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,340
strengths we offer unfortunately that

00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,320
means you have to actually do the

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,820
license review and that's time-consuming

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,580
and sometimes you've run into some

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:41,920
problems that are kind of awkward and

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:45,310
hard to solve and that gets in the way

00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,540
of people putting things into Debian and

00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:51,490
yes it's both a strength and a weakness

00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:55,450
and unfortunately we're seeing that a

00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:57,400
lot of people don't that you know in the

00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,230
web world of constant integration

00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,710
continuous integration and continuous

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:06,270
deployment people find that stability is

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,710
not something they want to focus on and

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:12,250
yeah we have experimental we have to be

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:14,919
unstable but our ability to handle

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:18,489
things that are in the space

00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:22,299
is not as good as it it's not is one of

00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:23,499
our weaknesses and of course only one

00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:25,600
version of the package can be installed

00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:29,820
and that's great from a security support

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:33,369
ability standpoint and I don't but it's

00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:36,249
challenging for as you get more and more

00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:45,159
packages that depend on that to get them

00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:49,570
to all work with a new version so what

00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:52,059
I'd like to do is kind of make a call to

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,919
be awesome I'm a call to find ways of

00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:55,600
addressing some of these weaknesses or

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,190
turning them into strengths and this

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,769
isn't something that DPL can do it's not

00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,739
my job it wouldn't be appropriate for me

00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:04,960
to to be you know doing some of this

00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:06,309
stuff but it's something where I hope

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,830
that some people will take up some of

00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:10,450
these challenges and one or two years

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,820
from now a DPL will be standing here

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:15,100
talking about how they have gotten a

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,200
project you know facilitated the project

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:22,749
moving forward and adopting some of

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:24,850
these things as as as our directions so

00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:26,559
almost everything does need a stable

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,840
base of dependencies whether it's you

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,399
know some container or even some

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,869
environment that you're gonna use to do

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,029
JavaScript development or something

00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:36,309
you've got something outside of your

00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:38,590
core application that you know you want

00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:40,059
to be running fast fast fast they need

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,399
to actually kind of like to be stable

00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:44,200
that should be debian fortunately this

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:51,100
is the one where we do the best in many

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:53,139
cases it is there we're actually doing

00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,269
okay in the docker space in the sort of

00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:58,539
you know service container space but in

00:27:55,269 --> 00:28:02,529
the flat-pack and snap world and the in

00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:05,769
the world of people building app

00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:07,960
containers I think a lot of people are

00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,940
migrating away from Debian and it makes

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,919
sense for the actual core upstream

00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,690
software if you're making an app

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,129
container for some game of course you're

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,039
gonna build your latest version of your

00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:20,889
game from source but what about all your

00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:24,279
dependencies it seems like given how

00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:26,139
many dependencies we can satisfy that we

00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:28,269
ought to make it easier for a lot of

00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:31,059
those dependencies to be satisfied from

00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:33,099
Debian and I feel like we're not

00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:36,970
achieving that and some of that's

00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:40,859
political but some of that's technical I

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,859
like this to see us do better on that

00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:48,940
and then what do we do about all these

00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,679
applications that either we're not going

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,509
to put in Debian or maybe we are gonna

00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:56,830
put in Debian but you want a newer

00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:59,739
version or the application moves too

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,419
fast for a stable release what do I mean

00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:04,259
I guess we can tell our users just use

00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:07,239
flat pack and use their repositories I

00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:10,269
as a Debian user find that unfulfilled

00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:12,669
um I mean maybe it is the right answer

00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:16,269
but I as a Debian you start really kind

00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:18,849
of like to trust Debian pretty much and

00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:21,159
only Debbie it at least as far as that

00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:23,529
can go it probably isn't gonna go that

00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,470
far for things that really do have the

00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:29,139
FSG problems or especially distribute

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:31,090
distribute ability problems but for a

00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:33,609
lot of stuff maybe we could do a lot

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:34,989
better so I'd really like to encourage

00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:37,529
people to think about those issues and

00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:44,139
see if any of them resonate and kind of

00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:46,840
you know be awesome at it so that's what

00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:50,259
I have I'd love to chat with you all and

00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:53,220
answer your questions or you know dodge

00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:53,220
your tomatoes or whatever

00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:04,489
[Applause]

00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:42,419
hi Sam

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:46,590
so I'll ask a traditional question yeah

00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:48,239
I'm over the moon at some of the some of

00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,830
the challenges that you're pushing as a

00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:53,220
DPL I think you're doing a really good

00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,840
job on those I hope you think you're

00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,820
doing a good good job as well I know a

00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,759
lot of other people seem to agree with

00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:03,450
that is it too early to ask if you go

00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,799
for a second term yeah so okay there are

00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,149
a couple of things to consider there I

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,389
think I'm gonna need to make that

00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:11,700
decision closer in but honestly I've

00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:13,289
been running pretty fast um and I guess

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,820
I should also let people know that I

00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:18,720
think I'm probably gonna be slowing down

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:20,940
a bit over the next couple of months the

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,710
first of all I think we've we've made

00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,570
some great progress but I also think you

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:28,080
know you want to you don't want to be in

00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:30,179
sprint mode all the time um but also I

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,129
happen to have a lot of time because of

00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,859
some stuff going on at my day job and my

00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:38,159
day job is gonna be more time consuming

00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:39,419
for me over the last couple months or

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,529
over the next couple of months than it

00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,259
has been over the last couple of months

00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:46,499
but more generally when it comes around

00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:51,989
to next to April um I think we should

00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:54,539
all ask ourselves whether running at

00:31:51,989 --> 00:31:57,330
this pace two years in a row is

00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:58,919
necessarily what we want to do and I

00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,049
think that there'll be some really

00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,879
interesting conversations to have the

00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:04,649
beginning of next spring both about

00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:06,869
whether I think that's what I want to do

00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:10,109
for my life and whether you guys think

00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:12,239
that that's what you want to do for the

00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:15,769
project I think that if things continue

00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:18,659
as they go I would really love to do a

00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:23,099
second term as DPL I'm not sure it

00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:25,859
should be a second consecutive term cool

00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:28,349
good answer thank you all so thank you

00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:30,869
very much for talking about mistakes on

00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:33,840
stage in front of this audience that is

00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:36,720
very strong of you and it's very

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,369
appreciated I'm tempted to come up and

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,210
give you a hug on stage I'm not sure how

00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:41,570
well that would work that would be

00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,570
well-received

00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,350
sixty

00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,580
hi Sam thanks a lot for your

00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:40,710
presentation and I just want to

00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:44,580
congratulate you and to say you that I

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:48,870
am I admire your a lot in the way you

00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:51,810
are taking the activities as Debian

00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:55,320
project leader really thanks a lot for

00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:58,470
and contributing to our community and

00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,940
representing us Thanks thanks for being

00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,770
such a wonderful community I mean this

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,860
is we are this is such a wonderful

00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,860
community

00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:13,389
[Applause]

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,980
I said its vagrant um I was wondering

00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:35,580
you specifically mentioned installing

00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,260
multiple versions of a package but do

00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,050
you have any ideas how to pull that off

00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,210
because fundamentally I mean there are a

00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:45,899
few things like that in Debian but by

00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:49,379
and large that's not the case and so I

00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:51,869
mean there's containers there's I mean

00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,909
so I mean basically what we've seen the

00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:56,340
the pretty much all the solutions in

00:34:53,909 --> 00:35:02,630
that space that we've seen in other

00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:05,010
ecosystems involve some level of

00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,320
creating an isolated environment whether

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:11,400
it's a Python richlum whether it's a

00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,920
ruby bundle whether it's a node modules

00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,390
directory whether it's I don't quite

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,180
know what they're doing with Ekman

00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,590
script yes six modules by the way

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:26,220
someone in Debian really needs to be

00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:28,230
looking at node and es6 because and in

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,060
excuse me in the extra script modules

00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,490
the the import modules in JavaScript

00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,770
because it looks like they're trying to

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:39,060
get rid of all searching for system

00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:41,160
modules which might not really meet our

00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,960
needs let's be plan to actually that

00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,369
would be really pretty awful and I

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,390
really hope I have not talked to the

00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:47,820
node maintainer is but I hope we have a

00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,589
strategy there um but so basically all

00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,390
you know and then there's containers so

00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:53,250
basically all the things that I'm aware

00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,930
of for installing multiple versions of

00:35:53,250 --> 00:36:00,150
the package involve isolating

00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:01,470
environments and there are I think there

00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,440
are lots of challenges for that in

00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,060
Debian main namely are you going to

00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,910
provide security support for all those

00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:12,330
versions and if not why is this an okay

00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:14,099
thing to do and yet there are a bunch of

00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:18,359
people who say that it's working for

00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:20,550
them for their um ups for their

00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:23,400
continuous integration stuff and there

00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,349
are Debian developers I respect who

00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,480
claim that it's that there are even

00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,369
models under which it's reasonable from

00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,300
a security standpoint I don't understand

00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:32,700
how that's true

00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,339
but someone should like figure that out

00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,920
and explain it to us and then we can

00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:39,180
talk about once we understand

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,490
and the models under which this is the

00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,250
same thing to do including for security

00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:47,790
then we can maybe you ask how could we

00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:49,170
apply that more generally to to Debian

00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,069
packages rather than to language

00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,069
specific packages

00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:09,019
hello thank you

00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:12,019
so I'm a thank you for the talk I'm this

00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:13,279
is my first step conf and it's very

00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:15,819
interesting to see the the strong

00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:19,279
community and find it very interesting

00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:20,719
I'm used to work with a bunch of fedora

00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:22,279
and CentOS environments and so I came to

00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,369
DAP Kampf to learn about the Debian

00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:27,859
ecosystem and one thing we do is we use

00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:31,399
software collections to install a bunch

00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:33,829
of packages separate from the operating

00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:37,939
system and I came to Def Con to ask if

00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:39,380
if this was a something the Debian could

00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:42,259
use and something I could work on for

00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,579
Debian so okay so there are a lot of

00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:45,709
ways in which we do have that today

00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:47,149
there are many people who run various

00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:49,669
collections of software that you can add

00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:54,380
as an app source but there's a project

00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:56,839
called bike shed that has been that that

00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:01,669
was a proposal a few years ago to make

00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:03,199
it much easier to do that and yes if

00:38:01,669 --> 00:38:05,899
you're interested in working on bike

00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:10,429
shed we sure we can get you information

00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:12,259
on how to do that and I think that we

00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:14,719
would love to see energy put behind that

00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:17,509
I'll also note that you know kind of the

00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:19,459
broader Debian community like the Debian

00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:22,519
ends up being the basis for a lot of

00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:24,739
work for example whoo - and the ability

00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,689
community has this concept called PPAs

00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:30,439
that are you know very similar to

00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:32,659
software collections and so you know

00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:34,849
there's and there there are various

00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:36,349
tools in Debian like repre pro and aptly

00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:38,719
that'll can allow you to create a

00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:44,299
software collection on your own but what

00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:48,529
we don't really have is a way to to do

00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:50,419
that at a project level and that's where

00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:56,119
the bike jet project comes in thank you

00:38:50,419 --> 00:39:00,769
very much there's a question from I

00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:03,289
receive regarding a level of tension the

00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:04,969
moon program get these days and the fact

00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:07,489
that the Debian is the universal

00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:11,149
operating system how can we get Debian

00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:12,430
and free software into space isn't it

00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:15,430
already

00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,480
I mean yeah I think my understanding is

00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,089
that there are a number of space

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,740
programs that are using Debian um so I

00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:23,289
mean more generally though I think we

00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,170
can you know that's something where we

00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:27,849
we do have an active for example

00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:30,069
aero-astro blends community I don't know

00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:32,950
if they're necessarily in the right

00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:35,770
place to to talk to people but I think

00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:38,200
the answer is with everything if you're

00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,789
interested in working on it go do it let

00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,640
the project know what you're doing ask

00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:44,619
for help ask for review where it makes

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,849
sense to you but you know that that
