###Context
Web tracking is a common practice used to monitor the behavior of a particular user on a website. This kind of data is frequently unauthorizedly collected all over the web by big corporations and used or sold for targeted advertising, which is a huge privacy concern.

###Content
In this short talk, we are going to briefly cover the most common fingerprinting methods used for tracking purposes. Subsequently, we are going to explain how to fight them by enhancing your web browser with several Free Software solutions.

###Audience
Anyone. No technical skills are required.

correct

00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:13,570
that's right this title is protecting

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,779
your web privacy with free software and

00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,609
the description web traffic chuckling is

00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:20,320
a common practice used to monitor the

00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:22,930
behavior of a particular user on a

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,570
website this kind of data is frequently

00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,670
unauthorized ly collected all over the

00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,039
way by big corporations are used or sold

00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,980
for targeted advertising which is a huge

00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,390
privacy concern in this short talk we

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,100
are going to briefly cover the most

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,500
common fingerprinting methods used for

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,380
tracking purposes subsequently we are

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,120
going to explain how to fight them by

00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,160
enhancing your web browser with several

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,160
free software solutions Pedro we look

00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,840
forward to hearing you thank you so as

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,329
she said I'm going to talk about how to

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,300
protect your web privacy with free

00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:59,170
software's but first of all let's

00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,809
explain what free software is it is not

00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,409
necessarily free of charges so a free

00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:08,649
software might be paid or not but what

00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:11,200
it's actually about is allowing users to

00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:15,520
have the freedom to run copy distribute

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,930
study change and improve the software so

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,000
this is the freedom that we're talking

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,460
about here and in order to accomplish

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,060
all of those points here

00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:27,430
we need free software to be open sourced

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,040
so every free software is also open

00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,380
source which means that anyone can go to

00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,830
its code and understand what's going on

00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,500
there

00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,600
so when we're talking about privacy this

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,479
is vital because if a free software is

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,100
said to be privacy friendly it means

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,470
that the community around it the

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,689
programmers can read its code and

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:50,710
guarantee that it's actually privacy

00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:54,220
friendly so on the other hand we have

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:56,470
closed sirs which are those which are

00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,509
those pieces of software that do not

00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,360
allow you to access its code so no

00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:03,369
programmer can read it and guarantee

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,899
that nothing shady is going on behind

00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:10,869
the scenes you cannot know for sure what

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:13,989
closer's is doing with users data so

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,110
true privacy cannot be reached with with

00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,840
closed our software

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,540
and okay with that explained let's

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,090
address on one of the big problems that

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,490
I want to talk here which started

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,370
advertising so target advertising is a

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,950
kind of ad that tries to reach as many

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,230
people as possible by choosing those

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,160
that are more likely to have interests

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,350
in a specific product so pregnant women

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,840
for example are more likely more likely

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,080
to buy maternity pants so they are more

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,800
likely of receiving this kind of ad as

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,720
well and well I suppose that most people

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,560
here have gone through a similar

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,870
situation in which you get an ad that

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,570
seems to perfectly fit you in your

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,760
current situation and that perfectly

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,550
with a perfect timing and to me that's

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,270
kind of knowing because sometimes I

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:12,900
don't really know how advertisers knew

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:16,740
that that ad would catch my interest so

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,350
well and well one of the reasons for

00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,510
that is because of these guys here so

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,730
data brokers data brokers collect

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,280
information about individuals from

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,370
different sources so maybe from public

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,090
sources like public recordings or maybe

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,070
from private sources like the like

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,650
social media and web pages that the

00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,650
person visit and the apps that this

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,720
person uses so what data brokers do is

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,940
they get all of the species of

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,130
information from different places they

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,890
put them together to make a profile

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,230
about you about this person and this

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,980
profile in might contain for example

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,510
this person's age purchasing power

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,200
religious beliefs and political

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:04,110
affiliations for example and the fact is

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,050
that every piece of information is

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,510
valuable to them because this is what

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,860
tells them what kind of products are

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,840
serviced you might be interested in and

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,299
I don't know often I hear people saying

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,330
well you know I don't really care about

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:24,810
targeted advertising because I prefer to

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:27,360
get an ad that might get my that might

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,669
be interesting to me then getting an ad

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,770
of a random products so I don't really

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,800
care about giving them my information I

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,300
don't care what they will do with it and

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,830
I don't know I think that this kind of

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,910
thought is a little bit dangerous

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:47,640
because well I'll show my point with an

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:51,150
example so let's take for example this

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:56,160
company let's call it a and let's say

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:58,919
that a sells alcoholic drinks okay and

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,740
then company a wants to target advertise

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:05,310
its product so what is going to do it is

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,550
going to hire an advertising company to

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:13,560
do that for it so keep that in mind and

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:19,470
now let's suppose that we have this this

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:22,229
pretty guy here let's call him B and

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,570
let's say that B has Anna and alcohol

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,610
abuse program and maybe he's trying to

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,210
quit it so he searches online how to

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:33,180
stop drinking and then now data brokers

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,250
know that B has an alcohol abuse problem

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,460
and we're going to talk how do they how

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,190
they know it later but so now they know

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,140
it and they're toast sell it they'll

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,210
sell this information to advertising

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,180
companies or well another thing that

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,979
might happen is that this data broker

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,260
company might be the same advertising

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,620
company so many times they're the same

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:58,710
but what matters here is that now this

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,289
advertising company knows that B drinks

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:06,150
a lot and what it is going to do it is

00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:10,229
going to try to show B it's going to try

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:12,870
to show to be a product so products like

00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:15,150
this so it's basically trying to sell

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:19,200
alcohol to a person that has an alcohol

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,870
abuse problem and I don't know I think

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,669
that this is questionable and this is

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,250
only one of the possible scenarios

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:29,130
because data brokers here they could

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,310
sell this information from B to his

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:35,070
health care insurance company and then

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,289
this health care insurance company now

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,809
knows that B

00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:41,550
might develop some kind of cirrhosis or

00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:44,460
something like that so what it is going

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:48,089
to do it's going to make bees healthcare

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,219
plan more expensive and this might sound

00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:52,139
like some kind of conspiration but this

00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:55,289
is the kind of thing that is it is

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:59,069
happening in Brazil this has been

00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:01,619
happening a lot and also in I've read

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:05,819
about this happening a lot in the United

00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:08,879
States as well but let's now talks about

00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:11,639
how data brokers know about this

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,580
information from B how they know that B

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,919
searched how to stop drinking so what

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,270
they use are these things called web

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:23,939
trackers which they basically put it

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,369
everywhere in the internet so and a lot

00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,139
of a lot of web pages contain web

00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:31,499
trackers and they're hidden

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:34,199
the user has no idea that it that it is

00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:36,689
there and according to a study that was

00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,319
published last month web trackers are

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:43,919
present on more than 94 percent of wave

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,889
web pages around at least those that

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,339
they have studied and I don't want to

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:52,709
get too technical here but I'm going to

00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,919
explain some of the techniques that they

00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:58,499
use and one of the most common ones is

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,139
tracking pixels so tracking pixels are

00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:03,899
present on webpages and emails and

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:08,610
they're usually invisible pixels one by

00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:11,129
one pixels that the data brokers sent to

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,139
you this image this image requests and

00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:15,599
in the moment that you accept these

00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:19,169
requests you send back your IP address

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,719
so they know that you're there a similar

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,269
approach is done with cookies so briefly

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:31,110
expelled explaining cookies are small

00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:33,599
text files that that that are placed on

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,490
your system when you visit a website and

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,519
they store your preferences so if you go

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:41,189
to webstore for example and you put an

00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,649
i10 on your cart and then you close that

00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:45,899
webpage and you open it another day and

00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,750
your items still there that's because of

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,850
cookies so cookies are nice but the

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,819
problem comes when third

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,380
is use cookies because they don't use to

00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:58,139
start they don't use it to store your

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,800
story or your preferences they use it to

00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:04,800
track you so it works more or less like

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:09,389
this our webpage cannot see cookies from

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,329
another webpage so if you visit a

00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:13,889
webpage and then a third party puts a

00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:16,230
cookie on your system through this

00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:19,110
webpage and then you visit another

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,180
webpage and then this same third party

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,940
puts another cookie on your system

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:27,000
through this other webpage then this

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,819
third party can see this this to cook is

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,810
because it belongs it belongs to them

00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:36,600
and so it has information about you from

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:40,399
these web to web sites and they can use

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,740
to make targeted advertising to you and

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,290
I'd like to show because I'm I don't

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,790
know if it's clear it's it's too clear I

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,699
get speaking like this so I'm going to

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:54,930
show this is Curitiba City Hall webpage

00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:57,420
and I have here this extension which is

00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,630
called you matrix which basically shows

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:04,199
me all the requests that I get on a web

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:09,060
page and according to this extension

00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:12,839
this guys here that are in the strong

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:17,310
red they are either ads or trackers or

00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:19,920
analytics and analytics are used by web

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,230
developers to further understand their

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,870
website so if I wanted to know if this

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:29,519
button here has been effective I can use

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:32,730
analytics to see how many clicks it has

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,370
and maybe if it's not being effective I

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:41,610
can put it here and then check if people

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:43,709
are clicking more there so okay so so

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,050
analytics are cool so you can improve

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:49,019
your website but again the problem comes

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,959
when you use closed sirs analytics

00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,269
because you can know for sure what

00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,310
they're doing with users data you can

00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:59,010
know if they're storing it if they're

00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,740
sending it back to the to the analytics

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,100
provider

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,770
and well there is another website

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,200
website here that I really want to show

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:13,750
you guys this is Brazilian government

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:18,140
web page and remember strong red our ads

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:26,380
analytics are trackers so take a look at

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:30,050
this it doesn't end

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:32,510
okay so we have many of those here and I

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,410
wasn't expecting to find those because

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:37,460
well it's from Brazilian government but

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,400
let's take a closer look of what's

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,100
happening here we have images so all of

00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:48,260
these images here are probably either

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:51,280
ads or pixel trackers and we also have a

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:56,600
lot of cookies so these cookies might be

00:11:51,280 --> 00:12:00,320
tracking cookies as well and well what

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,140
can a regular user do to prevent it how

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,660
can i how can i block all of this

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,940
records so first of all I recommend

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:11,060
using Firefox because it is free

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,790
software and because it has been

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,600
releasing a lot of privacy oriented

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:22,450
features lately so I recommend using

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:26,270
Firefox and going here to preferences

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:28,550
privacy and security and the first thing

00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:35,480
that we want to change is accept

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:38,510
third-party cookies never and a little

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,460
bit okay here tracking protection using

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,110
tracking protection use tracking

00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,450
protection to block known trackers

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,120
always so what's happening here I'm

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,910
basically blocking out third parties so

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,630
I won't get web trackers cookie web

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:57,050
trackers and I'm I'm blocking no known

00:12:53,630 --> 00:13:02,120
trackers that Firefox know that might

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:03,530
stop you and okay in the future just for

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,210
the record this is going to change

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,520
tracking protection will be called

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,280
browser content so for those in the

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,860
future

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,640
one thing that Firefox said is that in a

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,890
few months

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,350
so right now tracking protank

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,470
protections is only used by default if

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,390
you're in private windows but Firefox

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,970
Mozilla said that in the future

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,650
it's going to be always for everyone as

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,640
default which is awesome

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:34,110
and another thing that I recommend is

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,720
going here to add-ons extensions and

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:41,110
download downloading this guy here you

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,870
block origin so this one is a net

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:47,260
blocker it blocks ads and trackers and

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:49,410
analytics and you don't really have to

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,600
do anything it is free software as well

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,700
and you just have to leave it there and

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,010
it will do all the job for you and for

00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:01,030
those that have never used an ad blocker

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:03,490
before the Internet is going to seem

00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,950
like something really totally new

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,110
because you won't see you won't see ads

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,060
everywhere displayed in your screen and

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,530
you won't get those annoying ads in the

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,920
middle of your video when you're

00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:17,770
listening to music and so on so ok so

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,160
this three changes I recommend I

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:24,160
recommend doing that and okay ah another

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,030
thing here are you block origin I

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,390
recommend coming here open the dashboard

00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:34,089
future lists and coming here to privacy

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,070
and adding another coolest which is fun

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,430
boys enhanced tracking lists this is

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:44,620
really nice and then apply the change

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:47,800
okay so moving on there is another third

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:51,850
technique which I haven't mentioned yet

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,490
which is done by using Java Script so if

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,120
you pay attention here there's a lot of

00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:04,870
JavaScript injection here and this might

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:07,270
be for web tracking so so finger

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:10,690
printing is when you use JavaScript to

00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,880
retrieve the users information about its

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,860
hardware and browser and operating

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,110
system so you can get a lot of

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,780
information about that that guy's

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,730
computer and then if you combine all of

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,279
those and this combination

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:28,060
is unique it means that your fingerprint

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:31,029
is unique as well and this means that

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,550
your be if you allow allow these web

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,980
trackers to send you this JavaScript

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,720
requests you're basically allowing them

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,550
to see that you are you so you're

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,949
basically Brissac it's a it's a

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:46,959
signature of your computer basically and

00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:48,699
your browser and five minutes okay so if

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,620
we have five minutes I'd like to show

00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:53,920
this really quickly we have this website

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:56,320
from Electronic Frontier Foundation

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,600
which allows you to see if you're great

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,470
if your browser is safe against tracking

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,089
so I'm going to run it here in the

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:07,449
Firefox which we made the changes and

00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:10,389
then in a new Firefox brand new Firefox

00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:13,480
and then you're on tour browser which I

00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:16,930
haven't explained but briefly explaining

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,120
its use to anonymize you people use it

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:22,660
to browsing the Deep Web but you can use

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,510
it for regular browsing too so okay the

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:29,199
tests are Ryan and for this one wait

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:31,480
this is the regular one so we get that

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:35,050
your browser has a nearly unique

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:38,709
fingerprint and we've if we go here we

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:41,079
have that only one in ninety-eight

00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:43,959
thousand browsers have the same

00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:46,779
fingerprint as yours so it basically

00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:49,839
means that I'm not these guys what I

00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:52,000
want is for this number to be low

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,850
because I want to be these guys I want

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,579
to have a fingerprint that is similar to

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,949
many people so the web trackers don't

00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:02,410
know if that's me or him or him or him

00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:04,929
so this is a high number this is for a

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,540
brand new Firefox profile if we go to

00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:10,030
the one that we made the changes we get

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,530
no results probably because they cannot

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,589
load the trackers okay

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:17,919
and finally for browser for tor browser

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:22,199
do you have any idea of well what this

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,819
number is going to be one in any guess

00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,370
at all

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:31,480
well it's 98 thousand for tor browser we

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:33,610
go to 75 so we're really really these

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,590
guys so if you want to make a really

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,710
private search online

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:44,440
you can go for tour but doing this

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:47,320
changes is good enough as well so what

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:51,340
happens is sometimes this changes that I

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,200
said about you block origin and etc well

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,690
they use a list of known trackers to

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,200
block them but sometimes a tracker might

00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:00,909
not be present on that list so the

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,370
tracker will be able to send the

00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:05,289
JavaScript request and the only

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:08,770
workaround would be to turn off

00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:12,039
JavaScript which I do not recommend for

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:14,740
almost anyone because it will break most

00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:17,860
sites but the thing is I am a crazy

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,899
person and I do not use JavaScript on my

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,779
browser and I want to share something

00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:25,870
really interesting that happened I was

00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:28,960
going to register for that call and I

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,970
got this this registration forms uses

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,340
JavaScript without it you have to

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:38,260
navigate the validation dragons without

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:41,880
any help so I I turned on JavaScript

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:45,730
because I I have no suspicions about

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,250
that call but the fact is and now I

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,220
would like to talk a little bit with

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:54,490
with developers here because I'm a

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:57,399
developer too but as a user it is

00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:00,669
frustrating that I have to do all these

00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:03,850
workarounds and turn off JavaScript to

00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:06,490
try to protect my privacy this is an

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:11,559
absurd because regular users will never

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:16,179
do that so the thing is our privacy it

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:19,480
should be ours by default and I don't

00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:23,620
know if we have to struggle to have it

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:27,700
back it means that it was taken from us

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:30,070
and the coat proof is that if it was

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,470
taken from us it is because us

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,190
developers let it happen because

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:39,100
everyday web pages and apps and tools

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:41,290
that use closed sirs that are shady

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,300
are being released and every day

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,680
millions and millions and millions of

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,730
people are using these tools without

00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,700
realizing that every time that they do

00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:56,170
it they are killing their their privacy

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:58,990
again and again and again so this is I

00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:01,690
don't know I don't know how I'm asking

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,790
here is for those developers to stop a

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,010
little bit and think about our

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,540
responsibility in this process because

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,809
when we're dead when we're developing

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,929
we're kind of used to quickly look for

00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:16,690
the solution and sometimes we forget to

00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:20,980
think about the consequences of that

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:24,910
solution to the user so it is common for

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:27,429
a developer to use the to go strictly to

00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:31,030
the obvious solution in the market which

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:34,900
might be closers and it might not

00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:37,780
respect the user so I think that instead

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:41,110
of doing that we should create a habit

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:43,630
of going after alternatives looking for

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,809
alternatives that are free software and

00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:51,450
that our privacy friendly because after

00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:56,430
all users privacy is in our hands

00:20:51,450 --> 00:21:04,319
it is up to us to protect it thank you

00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:04,319
[Applause]

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,370
oh there's one okay sir

00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:26,469
could speak louder please mature

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,920
Oh

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,190
is it is it working okay first of all

00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:41,649
thank you for your presentation it was

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:43,720
really brief reading interesting and at

00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:47,350
the beginning were just saying and the

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,570
the convenience sometimes it has for the

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,369
advertising the content of the

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,220
advertisement that sometimes feels

00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:59,169
convenient for you you want to to see

00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:04,179
exactly the things you want and do you

00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:07,299
see any in this spectrum of just be have

00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:10,809
have total privacy and you have such

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:15,730
things as advertising convenience do you

00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:19,830
see any like in middle a bit too between

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,830
in this spectrum that would work

00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:27,220
actually that's something that nowadays

00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:29,830
it's hard to have a balance of that

00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,029
because every time that you look for

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,200
more and more privacy

00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:37,539
you left convenience aside and not only

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,730
that because the thing is that to have

00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:43,480
privacy you you also have to you need

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:45,129
the knowledge and sometimes money for

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,740
example if you want to really protect

00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:49,960
yourself you might go after a VPN and

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,330
things like that so this is the kind of

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:57,039
thing that regular users don't have

00:22:52,330 --> 00:23:00,070
access to usually so that's why I think

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,499
that the biggest change needs to come

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:04,659
from developers because after all we are

00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:06,999
developed we're given them the the

00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:09,639
products and we should guarantee that it

00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:12,100
concerns their privacy but yeah this is

00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:14,110
always the trickiest part to to balance

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,220
the actually like this question comes

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:20,259
mostly for the regular user right the

00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,159
ones that are not really aware of this

00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:26,769
kind of situation we're leaving and how

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,749
to manage with that I can imagine some

00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:31,029
more privates and more more transparency

00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:36,309
but most of all I think that developers

00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:38,250
may may be an answer to make make easy

00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:41,160
for the user to understand right

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:45,120
and and be able to also get advertising

00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:51,390
because the like maybe a second question

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:56,190
for you but you we usually relate data

00:23:51,390 --> 00:24:00,270
with advertising but what would would

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:03,780
that be maybe the answer to have no

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:08,340
relation between data in advertising at

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:12,510
all like the main reason for like like a

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:17,130
thing is would you would you we just say

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:20,160
that like the there should be no

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:22,500
relation between data in advertising at

00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:26,250
all maybe like what I'm suggesting is

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,200
maybe other ways consider like I'm

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:31,020
trying to be the as most neutral as

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:35,700
possible okay considering that not only

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:37,730
the convenience but the and the the deck

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,980
techniques for the advertiser

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:44,220
advertisers understand the user would

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,870
there be may be other paths you know and

00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:53,310
maybe it's the same question it just

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:56,040
bring it to you well of course can we

00:24:53,310 --> 00:25:01,020
take a break

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:03,660
thank you and and then in the interest

00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,600
of time could we also take your question

00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:09,560
to IRC please thank you thank you so

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,560
much Peter thank you

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:15,510
