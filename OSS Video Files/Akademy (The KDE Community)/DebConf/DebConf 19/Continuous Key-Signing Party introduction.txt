One of DebConf’s recurring activities is the Key Signing Party. It helps Debian strengthen and expand its web of trust. This session will:

* Explain how keysigning is done in a DebConf setting
* Validate the SHA256 hash of the KSP coordination document
* Explain how to participate to people who did not send their keys in time

next up is Samuel Henrique and he's

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,580
going to teach us a bit more about

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:16,830
designing and how to do it

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:20,430
Thanks afternoon everyone so I will

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,580
start by saying a few words about GPG

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,400
and why we are here just because I know

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,900
we have some new people around and this

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,770
is their first key signing that they're

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:36,000
attending so what is your key the key is

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,370
something that you have I mean you have

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,070
a pair of key right you have read public

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,380
key in private private key you keep the

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,780
private private to yourself and this

00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,100
something that we use as a means of

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,890
identification

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,940
especially on Debian project this is one

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,460
of the users of GPG right this I will be

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,110
scoping down these explanations for our

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:05,519
new starters so I hope everybody created

00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:09,210
their kiss and sent them on the

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,719
registration and you can confirm that by

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,719
getting the list of keys that I sent on

00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,689
an email this anybody doesn't have this

00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,659
list of file of keys so I'm assuming

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,340
everybody's set by now and that you

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,020
already checked that your key is in

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,939
there and this the fingerprint is

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,240
correct and the number is correct as

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:38,700
well and this the same as in your badge

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:40,619
right so how do we make sure that this

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,829
key can be used as a means of

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:47,310
identification we have this thing called

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,979
web of trust that is with York on qui

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,709
key you can use it to sign stuff and

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,439
works more or less like a physical sign

00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:58,350
you are using your own identification to

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,149
sign something and assuring that that

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,179
that thing you are signing with your own

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:06,649
identification so what we do is we sign

00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:10,020
each other's keys for example I can sign

00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:13,950
local skis and when I do that I am

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:18,360
saying that I know that this key belongs

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,250
to Lucas and Lucas might sign the key

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,140
another person and then when I see the

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,030
key of this other person that I did in

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,200
person in sign I can see that Luke has

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,260
already signed that key

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,990
so I have kinda like a path of trust to

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,360
that key and I can up to some level have

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,490
some trust that that key belongs to the

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,940
person that is named on on the key

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,310
itself and with this we'll wind up with

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,209
a big web of connection between the keys

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:48,360
that is made by these signatures Kunar

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,310
was really kind of preparing a bunch of

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,730
graphs for all of the keys that is on

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,140
the list so he sent the the ull on the

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,300
mini list and is also in the dog's

00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,190
description and if you click there and

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,810
you can search for your key click on the

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,170
key and then you will be able to see

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,180
this which is a graph with your key will

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,280
be the black one in the middle and all

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,470
of the connections that this key have

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,450
with the other keys in this list right

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:18,660
so the blue ones are keys that signed my

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,030
key and the ones that are white but just

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,370
with the blue sorry the green ones are

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,310
the ones that sign monkey and the ones

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,590
in blue are the ones which I signed but

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,900
the key doesn't have a signature back to

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,970
mine this can have this happen for a

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,450
bunch of reasons we can discuss that

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,980
later

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:41,970
so having the web us first we can share

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:46,830
a good level of authentication in the

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,690
project what if your key didn't make it

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,940
to the list we had a bunch of keys I

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,700
think was 18 lists that didn't make it

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,830
to the list because I think all of them

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,560
were because they weren't accessible on

00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,000
a public key server because when you

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,650
create our keeper you need to send a

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,840
public one to a server and this server

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,459
will sync with a bunch of other servers

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,650
it will become a pool of servers with

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:12,060
kiss and then anybody can retrieve your

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,350
public key and this is needed to if

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,519
somebody wants to sign your key this

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,410
person needs to have your public key

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,709
because they will be signing your

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,570
apology so this 18 keys didn't make it

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,580
to the list if your key is one of these

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,770
or if you didn't send your key arrow you

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,200
can still participate in the key signing

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,539
party the only difference is that you

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,810
won't be able to use the number or that

00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:33,790
we have in the batch

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,919
and you have to pass the full

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,520
fingerprint of your key to this person

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,280
some people like to do it like this even

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,630
by choice and what they do is they print

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,400
the fingerprint in a little piece of

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,880
paper and then they give it to you when

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:54,100
you you are exchanging signatures so

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:57,669
what are the next steps for this does

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,470
everybody have the file or I see a bunch

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:04,990
of people's computers I'm assuming who

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:08,050
have good help to check the sha-256

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,590
checksum of the file so I'm also

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,090
assuming that everybody checked that

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,310
there are fingerprints are correctly on

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,440
the file and in the correct number oh

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,630
and a quick note you might see that in

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,840
the list some numbers are skipped and

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,610
that's because we had reserved the

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,090
numbers for some gifts that were

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,889
registering the system but then we we

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,210
couldn't import the gift to the list

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,220
because they were inaccessible on a

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,380
public server so that's fine don't worry

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,720
if you'reif is missing some numbers you

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,390
should be missing about 18 numbers if I

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,910
recall correctly so what we have to do

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,729
now is we need to check that everybody

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,220
has the same file with the same list of

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:50,740
this because it could happen that one of

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,900
these is corrupted and when you change

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,640
signatures with the person you you can

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,950
mark for example I were gonna sign the

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,410
key number 20 and it could happen that

00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,070
in your list the key number 20 is from

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,510
somebody else

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,810
so that's why you need to do this all

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:09,030
together so what we will do now is I

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:12,639
would like to ask everyone to run the

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,770
sha-256 checksum on the file and then

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,979
I'm gonna ask I know

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,960
random people to shout out the Texan and

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,510
I'm gonna write it here in big letters

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:28,510
and we can confirm that everybody has

00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:31,750
the same file right this is everybody

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:34,000
ready like I don't know do we have a

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,690
volunteer to just say the first four

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,979
letters and numbers of the hash Jonas

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,680
you don't need to meet the Mike because

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:55,880

four six perfect okay

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:37,590
so now we should be ready to proceed

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,130
with the key singing I would just say a

00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:48,490
few words

00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:51,190
oh yes anybody wants you so how would

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:54,250
this proceed now so what we will do is

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,260
we will meet with someone and then let's

00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,610
say I want to sign

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:02,770
Lucas s key again and I will you ask me

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,280
to sign his key and I asked him for some

00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:07,780
sort of proof of identity because what

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,250
you're doing is exactly that you are

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,060
saying that this key belongs to this

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,530
person so you need to it's on your own a

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,270
judgment how you want to make sure of

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,890
that

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:21,460
for example for people that I know for a

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:23,710
long time I I wouldn't need an ID and

00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,200
Lucas is one of these examples I'm here

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,510
I differ from him but for people that I

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,870
I never met before I would need at least

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:35,410
a passport and I'll need to check if the

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:37,120
passport is it's fine it's if the

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,190
picture is okay if you still valid all

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,260
this kind of stuff but it will be on

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:48,010
your own judgment

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:54,730
and I think that's all we do have time

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:57,420
for questions yes yes yes we have

00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,420
minutes more

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:10,290
perfect oh let me talk about the signing

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,730
process itself right so you will check

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,090
the idea of the person sorry I forgot

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,710
about that

00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,660
you check the idea of the person and

00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,220
then you mark on your list because there

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,330
is a list you can print you can check

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,100
that you already check the

00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,170
identification of the person in the

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,820
fingerprint and then you can cite when

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,630
you want usually people sign at home

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,670
they keep the paper or whatever thing

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,350
they marked the ones that they will sign

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,120
and then they sign at home and then they

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,700
send the kids over to the person or to

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:44,820
the public server directly usually it

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:47,040
same to the person not well I'm

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,410
finishing with this I wanted to say I'm

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,820
done but it will take a couple of more

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:57,450
minutes I am going to add a copy of the

00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:00,060
SHA a checksum I got in the index that

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,550
he mentioned that I have with the maps

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,460
and I'm also adding a text version of

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:08,400
save maps that is not so beautiful but

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:12,360
maybe it probably more useful so well

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:14,880
and well please compute the the checksum

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,560
by yourself each of you don't copy also

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,080
sorry

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,230
I would like to suggest you to not only

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,150
check the fingerprint of your key as it

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,600
appears on the list but also as it

00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:30,450
appear on your badge from Daddy yes you

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,070
cannot trust I mean I hope now our our

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,690
organizing team is not trying to trick

00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,510
us but in line of principle you should

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,280
be responsible for checking yourself the

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,900
information you give others about your

00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,610
key that's correct

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:47,430
make sure your key it's correct on your

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:50,730
bed also oh I am one of the old people

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:55,310
here I think and I still remember when I

00:13:50,730 --> 00:14:00,480
was not one of the old people here and

00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:03,540
my point of this is if any of you are

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,070
confused about any of this thing that

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:11,310
just happened here the last 30 minutes

00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:14,030
then don't worry grab someone who is

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:17,120
older than you and asked them is

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:20,960
just ask them politely if they can take

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,910
five minutes to do slowly just that the

00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,450
the very important thing here is that

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:29,840
don't do anything with this crypto stuff

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:34,310
that you don't understand so it's better

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:38,240
to not sign then to sign because

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:40,130
everybody else does it don't just pass

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,950
on or do whatever the other does don't

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,900
copy what others do the important thing

00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,840
here is that you do what you feel

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:50,540
comfortable understanding that what is

00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,390
what is happening here and there are a

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,490
lot of people who are have spent years

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,300
trying to understand this and now that

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:02,720
we do a few of us maybe hopefully more

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:06,610
we are happy to share our epiphany of

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,800
what is this weird thing so please ask

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:18,770
for repetition it's not embarrassing at

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:21,890
all it's good also I don't know if it

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:25,280
was mentioned but you can use the CAF

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:37,820
package to sign the keys from the

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:39,920
signing party package it is no but yeah

00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,110
who is right you can use CAF do easily

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,020
signed a bunch of signatures and it will

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,089
automatically send the sign it keys to

00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:57,200
the holder of the keys to the email that

00:15:47,089 --> 00:16:00,790
is recorded on the key yeah so what I

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:04,010
mean sorry so to summarize what was just

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:06,920
just said all to all of people because

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,930
no I guess people who were not using

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,480
stuff and haven't yet sign anything

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:14,300
might feel confused so basically when

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,100
you I will advise everybody especially

00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,960
those people who haven't signed anything

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,000
not to sign anything at the conference

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:26,450
just make notes go home get some sleep

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,890
wash your clothes and then sit sit down

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,410
quietly and

00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:35,210
sign your keys and there is package

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:39,230
called cafe FF in Debian and then you

00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:42,050
give it list of ID's of keys that you

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,960
want to sign then it prints all the

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:47,330
information so you could you should

00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:50,720
check it once again that all emails are

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:53,570
matching or signature or check sums are

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,160
matching and so on and then it asks you

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,820
again if you want to sign this

00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,840
particular key then okay and then it

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,589
sends it doesn't upload those signatures

00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,480
to key servers but it sends it to

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:13,280
appropriate emails and then this person

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,500
who is who is supposed to whose keys is

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,070
supposed to be then this person is

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,820
responsible to get this key and

00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:24,940
integrate this into his or her key

00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:27,440
keyring and then upload this so this is

00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:30,800
secondary check because this way you are

00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,080
checking that email is working and image

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,670
really belongs to this person because

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:40,250
then SAP also encrypt this your

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:43,940
signature with public key of this person

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:48,530
so it's sounds a bit complex so so read

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:51,380
it again as I said at home in quietness

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:54,620
and so on and and then be careful and

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:57,710
another another remark after Jonah's a

00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,020
so different people has slide have

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,030
slightly different approaches to signing

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,300
some some people are more eager to sign

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:08,300
you some people are not no less eager so

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,190
don't be discouraged and don't and

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:14,810
accept that different people use

00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:16,580
different approaches okay question and

00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,710
in the spirit of asking about things you

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,630
don't understand there's been a few

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,910
person on Planet Debian stuff recently

00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,670
about weird problems going on in the key

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,400
server Network can anyone care to

00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:29,780
quickly explain what that's about people

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,540
who don't really understand it like me

00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:35,060
and specifically if that should make us

00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,280
in the room perhaps start doing anything

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,610
differently with regard to GPG and all

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,610
that stuff

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:46,380
the problem with the key server network

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,530
is that it accepts an upload of

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:53,070
anybody's key by anybody else so that

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,230
means you can add signatures to somebody

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,480
else's key and the key server network

00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:00,150
will nicely add those signatures into

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,850
its stored version of that key now these

00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:06,690
signatures can be malicious they can be

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:10,370
ten thousands of random crap and this

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:14,250
then box down the key a lot so that

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:17,850
typical uses of the key like using that

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:19,860
Thunderbird add-on to see whether an

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,670
email was generally signed basically

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:26,790
breaks because Thunderbird tries for 30

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:29,600
minutes to verify that email with that

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,620
broken key which you got via the last

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,260
automatic scheduled

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,070
thank you very much GPG for that update

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:41,060
of that key from the key server so the

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,140
cryptography is not broken GPG is

00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,060
completely broken but from a user

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,370
interface perspective not from a

00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,680
technical perspective and that hasn't

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,560
changed at all the problem is just that

00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,370
there's now more pressure to move to

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:59,190
something else and DSA has done two

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:02,940
things for Debian developers the one

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,980
thing is called wkd that's web key

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,040
discovery protocol

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:11,280
it actually means you throw your key on

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:14,610
to a web server and it can be downloaded

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,590
and in the next iteration of GPG which

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,290
has just been released a week ago also

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:22,800
updated from this web server and that

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:25,710
web servers run for all Dedes by DSA so

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,090
in case you're a DD with a key in the

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,920
key ring that is already available via

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,710
wkd and the other thing is a similar

00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:40,170
protocol based on dns so in there's a

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:44,820
DNS entry now which is called Dane da

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:48,420
and or based on the day in protocol and

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,100
so your key now becomes discoverable via

00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,920
DNS as well so there are two parallel

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,070
ways which would not rely on

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,680
key server Network anymore but still I

00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,540
think somebody needs to fix the key

00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:06,510
server Network and I've written a blog

00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:11,700
post on it so there's no there's no risk

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:14,100
for you except that somebody pollutes

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,260
your key on the keys of a network

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,200
because that somebody is having fun with

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:22,920
that keys of a network if you receive

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,840
such a fake signature yes your GPG will

00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,180
try for an hour to import it and

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,860
depending on how much patience you have

00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,290
it will either achieve that and you can

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:35,520
delete them later or you just press

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:37,680
control-c and nothing has happened if

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,360
you care much about your public key ring

00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,520
so all the signatures you've collected

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,410
from some people you know have a backup

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,210
that's good practice anyway is because

00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,550
restoring from that may be easier than

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,860
cleaning the key cleaning the key takes

00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,810
depending on what a PC you have and how

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:57,600
many signatures we're talking 30 minutes

00:21:51,810 --> 00:22:00,780
to two hours like too much mention

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,360
before shortly different people have

00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,610
different approaches to key signing you

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,980
are not obliged to sign the key of

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:13,890
anyone so apply your own policy of whom

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,980
you want to sign don't feel pressured to

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:19,320
sign anyone's key there are some people

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,950
sending out regular mails you haven't

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,890
signed my key yet rather refrain from

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:28,590
that some people take more time to sign

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:33,450
keys some people just don't want to sign

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:40,160
some people's keys which is also fine so

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:40,160
yeah we're out of time okay

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,760
the CAF F program which which is indeed

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,670
very useful and everybody should use it

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,130
is located in the signing party package

00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:59,100
