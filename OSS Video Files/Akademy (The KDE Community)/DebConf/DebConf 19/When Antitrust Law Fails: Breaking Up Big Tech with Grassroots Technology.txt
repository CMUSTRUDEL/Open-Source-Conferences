From chats apps to cloud storage, the dominant cloud-based services are
designed to be walled gardens: they prohibit inter-operation with other
platforms, they control the flow of your data, and they use network
effects to lock you in. Big tech companies have used this “walled
garden” business model to concentrate market control, leaving consumers
with fewer and fewer real options. In the United States, antitrust law
hasn’t yet succeeded in stopping the concentration of power. But users
want a new way to compute in the cloud: one that is free, open,
trustworthy, and empowering. What should you do while the law catches up
with technology? Free yourself from big tech using grassroots
technology. Enter FreedomBox.

FreedomBox is Debian’s home server system: it is a Debian pure blend
designed to make it easy for anyone to host their own server on
inexpensive, pocket-sized computer hardware. FreedomBox is designed
around the principle that the exploitation of user data and attention
should be technologically impossible. Its simple user interface empowers
individuals to host their own Internet services without technical
expertise, like an encrypted chat server that can replace Whatsapp, a
VoIP server, a personal website, file sharing, a metasearch engine, and
much more. In April 2019, sales of the first-ever commercial FreedomBox
product were launched. The product, dubbed a “Pioneer Edition FreedomBox
Home Server Kit,” is being sold by Olimex, a company which specializes
in Open Source Hardware.

In this talk, you will learn about big tech’s concentration of market
control, how it effects users who rely on cloud services, and why
antitrust law hasn’t succeeded in protecting consumers against this
threat. Next, you will learn why Debian’s world-class software ecosystem
should provide the alternative to big tech. Last, you will learn how
FreedomBox uses Debian to empower people to leave big tech platforms.

This session is targeted at a general audience who is interested in big
tech and the cloud. No prior technical knowledge is required.

	00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,680
he will tell us what happened when

00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:14,920
antitrust law fails thank you very much

00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,369
morning everyone and thanks for making

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:22,029
your way to this session I I traveled

00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:25,149
for 23 hours on three different flights

00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:28,899
to get from New York City to Curitiba

00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:31,630
and I'm very happy that I can finally

00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:33,790
share some of my ideas with you today

00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,469
I'm going to talk about antitrust law

00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,280
how many of you have heard about

00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:41,200
antitrust you know some of you well

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,900
today I'm not going to be delivering a

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,570
talk that is strictly about technology

00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,990
I'm gonna try to relate the Debian's

00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,940
mission to some social and political

00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:57,970
issues that the world is facing right

00:00:51,940 --> 00:01:00,460
now I'm worried about technology and I'm

00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:04,049
worried about its effect on democracy

00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,970
and I'm worried about its effect on us

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,670
at the freedombox foundation I work on

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,520
making technology work for democracy and

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:16,030
I work on making technology work for all

00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,670
of us but I'm not a software developer

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:22,390
and I'm not a software a lawyer I'm a

00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:26,130
software activist and I'm trying to use

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:29,680
Debian to solve some pretty big issues

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,260
here's one of them the economy is

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,780
concentrated and what this means is that

00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:38,350
a small number of companies control

00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,960
entire industries it wasn't always this

00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,960
way in fact in the last two decades over

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,580
75% of industries in the United States

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,280
have experienced an increase in

00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:52,540
concentration levels so here's what that

00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:55,810
looks like it means that industries like

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,119
IT and transportation and finance used

00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,150
to have a smaller proportion of their

00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:03,340
market share controlled by the top four

00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,880
firms but now as you can see from this

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,519
graph a greater proportion of their top

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,650
of their market is controlled by the top

00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:17,560
four firms so we have a problem and that

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,569
is that industry concentration is bad

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,409
it's bad for the economy because it

00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,409
means that there is more

00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:26,659
anti-competitive behavior being carried

00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:28,189
out by these companies and that means

00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:30,500
that you get less investment to new

00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:32,659
ideas that means you have fewer

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,489
competitors and less competition and

00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:37,939
that ultimately means you get less

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:40,459
innovation across sectors but it's also

00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:42,590
bad for democracy and it's bad because

00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:45,140
it means more corporate influence on the

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,480
political system that's possible because

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,389
whenever you have a small number of

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,750
firms within an industry it's easier for

00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:56,329
them to coordinate their activities and

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,250
come to a shared set of principles that

00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:01,310
they want to lobby for in government and

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,980
so if an industry has six major actors

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,349
instead of 60 it's easy for them to come

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,090
together in a trade association and put

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:10,040
all of their money into one lobbying

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,769
firm and lobby for some change in

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,680
government but it's also bad because it

00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:18,250
means more wealth inequality and that

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,849
creates an appetite for extremist

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,849
nationalistic politics

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,910
now we've actually been through this

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,560
pattern before we've been through a

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,680
pattern of having

00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,690
a Gilded Age of having so much

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,880
concentration in industries that these

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,459
titans of corporations can control the

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:46,569
political system here's a cartoon from

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:49,270
the 1890s back in the 1890s through the

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,650
the 1920s there was so much industry

00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,090
concentration throughout the world

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,390
throughout the throughout the United

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,550
States throughout Europe that the people

00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,290
throughout the world wanted something

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,069
different they started to demand extreme

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:05,239
change

00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:06,889
and that's how we got World War 2 the

00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,599
tech industry in particular is

00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,769
concentrated and its story of

00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:15,109
concentration is a little unique uh

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:17,959
here's a graph which shows you patterns

00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:22,729
of concentration in in the tech industry

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:25,729
and ever since 1997 a number of the

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:30,080
sectors in tech like data centers like

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:32,360
like sorry like telephone lines have

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,870
gotten more and more concentrated all of

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,000
the orange dots which are above the line

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,039
indicate that a sub sector with NIT has

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,960
become more concentrated as you can see

00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,539
there are only about four or five sub

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,520
sectors in IT that haven't become more

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:48,520
concentrated since 1997 and

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,300
concentration in IT means that we have

00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,770
fewer alternatives if you're having

00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,780
problems with if you're having problems

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,690
with your telecommunications company

00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,180
like Comcast then you have fewer

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,280
alternatives

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,530
it also means user lock-in because once

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,690
you have network effects on platforms

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,949
like Facebook it becomes really hard to

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,830
leave because that's where all your

00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,780
friends are and it also means less

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,430
interoperability because now these

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,560
companies at the top have so much

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:23,900
control that they can make it difficult

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,930
for others I up starts to make platforms

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,159
that compete with the the major platform

00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,990
by having some kind of an

00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:31,580
interoperability this is why Twitter

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,460
won't make it easy for Mastodon to

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,740
interoperate and it also means less

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,420
freedom for users

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,070
shouldn't there be a law against all of

00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,440
this if we went through this in the

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,820
Gilded Age over a hundred years ago why

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,760
are we putting ourselves through it

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,480
again well there actually are laws for

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,890
this antitrust and anti merger laws

00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,350
antitrust laws are supposed to break up

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,970
companies once they get too big and anti

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,950
emergere laws are supposed to prevent

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,760
companies from joining together to

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:06,210
create a monopoly but the law didn't do

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:11,750
its job and there are a couple reasons

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:13,860
why the first reason is george w bush

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,510
maybe you thought we would never be

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,310
criticizing george bush again after

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,530
Donald Trump became president of the US

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,870
but turns out some of his policies are

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,490
still affecting the world today the Bush

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,250
administration decided that it would

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,430
carry out exactly zero anti anti

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,110
monopoly antitrust cases and it's the

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,300
responsibility of a presidential

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,860
administration to carry out these cases

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,160
through its Department of Justice it

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:42,540
also blocked zero major mergers in its

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,070
eight years in office and the second

00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,100
reason why all of this happened despite

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:50,460
the law is that antitrust ignored tech

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,620
it ignored tech because of a myth the

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,750
myth the myth is that all tech companies

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,460
eventually decline how many of you have

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,960
heard of this myth before that after

00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,220
five years or so Facebook is going to

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,230
fall and someone else is going to take

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,430
its place after all that's what happened

00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,720
to myspace that's what happened to

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,410
Friendster that's what happened to

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,220
AltaVista and the list goes on and on

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:13,020
but that myth turned out to be false

00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:17,190
because concentration happened anyway in

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:19,380
fact Facebook enjoyed 67 unchallenged

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,910
acquisitions of its competitors like

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:27,000
Instagram and whatsapp Amazon 91 Google

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:29,850
214 unchallenged acquisitions this is

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,220
important because it means that the

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:34,650
major companies at the top of the tech

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,560
industry were allowed to acquire a lot

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:41,500
of power that myth that myths had a lot

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:46,060
of force and big tech was born

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:49,660
so the law hasn't done its job we have

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:54,100
to do our job we have to break up big

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:57,850
tech with small tech and now we can talk

00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:02,830
about freedom box freedom box is a small

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:04,810
simple home server most digital services

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,160
are run by big tech almost everything

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,350
you can do on the Internet

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,660
has to go through a major tech platform

00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,360
if you use the Internet in the way that

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,780
most people do messages are run by big

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,210
tech whatsapp Facebook messenger VoIP

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,700
calls are run by big tech social media

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,460
apps are run by big tech blogs calendars

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,200
why can't we run our own services that's

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,140
because most of us don't run a server

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,540
after all servers provide services and

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,280
there are always two parts to computing

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,500
in the digital age there are servers and

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,120
there are clients our laptops our

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,099
smartphones those are the clients that

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,500
we use to access the servers the

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:44,950
server's run the software they have the

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,470
data and they have the log files servers

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,830
are at the center of the web and we

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:55,820
don't control the center of the web

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:57,920
they do to regain control of the web we

00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,750
need to redo centralize it and that's

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,920
where freedom box comes in freedom box

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:06,020
was founded in 2010 because we

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,810
anticipated that the web was going to be

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,880
centralizing freedom box is made out of

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,670
two ingredients a software system which

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,160
is a Debian pure blend and hardware

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:19,430
which costs anywhere from 30 to 100 US

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,440
dollars we target our hardware towards

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,650
single board computers freedom box

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,020
offers 20-plus built-in applications and

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:30,320
services like a mess a messenger voice

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,360
calls a blog a VPN tour and even more

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,250
and it's designed for anyone who wants

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,380
to regain control of their data we're

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,530
trying to make this as easy as possible

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,810
for non-technical users so let's start

00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:44,330
with an overview of the hardware we

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,850
picked Debian to be the base of the

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,830
freedombox system because we wanted our

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,350
system to be Universal we wanted it to

00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,270
be compatible with old laptops old

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:56,950
desktops and inexpensive single board

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:59,510
computers that was a very good decision

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,420
and we also specifically wanted to

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,070
create images that targeted around 10 or

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,150
so single board computers so that it

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,940
would be even easier than just

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,590
installing Debian right now there are 13

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,320
single board computers that we build

00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,510
custom images for and they're listed

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,680
right there on our website

00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,640
and you can build a freedom box with

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,630
materials that most of you probably

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,630
already have it

00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:30,439
but now let's talk about the software

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,239
the software is a Debian pure blend now

00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:33,949
this means a lot of things but first and

00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:36,170
foremost it means that our server system

00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:38,029
is free as in freedom there are a lot of

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,709
competing server systems emerging right

00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:41,959
now which are trying to solve the same

00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:44,360
problem that we are what makes us

00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,929
special is that we're we're totally free

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,420
and we will always be free another thing

00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:52,759
about Debian is that its ecosystem

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,769
invites competition and innovation it's

00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,529
not possible for an ecosystem which is

00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:58,999
based within Debian to have that kind of

00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:01,189
concentration of industries it will

00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:04,040
always be possible for someone running a

00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:06,139
Debian based network infrastructure to

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,790
interoperate and to expand and to give

00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:10,149
the power to the users not the people

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,499
who are providing the servers and

00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:14,949
another really important point I want to

00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:17,540
draw out is that Debian has

00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:19,670
interoperable interoperability built

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,049
into its services this is something that

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,579
we take for granted but I want to spend

00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:26,899
some time about it our servers are

00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:28,910
interoperable because when you have a

00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,779
matrix a matrix instance running on a

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,449
freedombox

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,759
anyone else's matrix matrix instance on

00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:38,209
their freedombox can be made to talk to

00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:39,829
yours if you are and that that same

00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:41,209
thing applies to any other federated

00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,959
service that you want to install on your

00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:43,489
freedombox

00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,660
you're never going to be trapped by the

00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:46,399
software you're never going to be

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,199
trapped by the provider because you'll

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,199
become the provider of the server

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,960
interoperability promotes innovation in

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:59,100
fact copyright law in the United States

00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:03,810
has tended to protect interoperability

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:06,280
as one scholar marc lammle notes

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,900
interoperability is the reason that we

00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,500
can even read documents that were

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,510
written on Mac on a Mac on a Macintosh

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,690
computer the fact that the law has

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:19,120
insisted that our systems protect

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,860
interoperability is the reason that we

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,420
can even do things on different

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,460
operating systems in the first place and

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,410
another argument I want to make is that

00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,050
interoperability may be the best way to

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,730
fight the silos of big tech cory

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,490
doctorow wrote a blog a couple of weeks

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,200
ago for EFS and what he argues is that

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,480
we have two options when it comes to big

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,980
tech the first is we can try to regulate

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,810
Facebook we can try to regulate

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,690
Instagram and whatsapp and we can try to

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:46,769
make them more benign we can try to make

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,829
them behave in more trustworthy ways

00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:52,139
on the other hand what we could do is we

00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:54,629
could insist that they impose some

00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:57,809
interoperable standards so that somebody

00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:59,550
could for example run a diaspora pod

00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:01,860
which interoperates with Facebook and

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,959
enables any Facebook user to migrate all

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,769
of their data to this pod so they don't

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:09,389
have to rely on the Facebook company

00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,769
that's a pretty powerful idea but we

00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:13,649
know that the law moves a little bit

00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,660
slowly so why not just use the software

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:17,790
ecosystem which already exists and

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,519
already has interoperability built into

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:23,970
it that's why I think debian is poised

00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,920
to become the alternative and in an age

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:30,540
in which users feel like they have no

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,699
alternatives and yesterday what I

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,069
learned in Sam Hartman's very moving

00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:37,199
talk was that almost everything needs a

00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:39,989
stable base of dependencies that should

00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,540
be debian I agree I agree if we're going

00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:44,129
to Reedy centralize the web and we're

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,869
going to do it with a single board

00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:47,970
computers and we're trying to make it as

00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:49,829
accessible as possible to everyone

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,779
throughout the world then the base of

00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:54,139
that software system should be double

00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:56,040
yin because debian has a track record of

00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,959
promoting freedom promoting

00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,290
interoperability and gaining the trust

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,079
of its users so let's talk a little bit

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,999
more about the software in freedombox

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:08,519
the user interface is democratized it's

00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:10,019
designed for non-experts it's also

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,059
simple we want to make it as easy as

00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,040
possible to install an application and

00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,600
it's streamlined we want to automate

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,939
whatever can be automated so that

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,490
administering a server doesn't require a

00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:22,649
lot of work here are some screenshots of

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,179
what the first boot looks like when you

00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:25,889
first plug in your freedom box to your

00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:28,709
router you go onto your computer and you

00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:34,199
type freedom box that local or you type

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:35,939
the local IP address 192.168.1.1 it says

00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:37,799
start setup so you click you click that

00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:40,169
button and then you get this prompt

00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,269
enter a user name and enter a password

00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:44,879
you're now creating your administrator

00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:47,399
account wait a few seconds and then here

00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,829
you go user account created you are now

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,869
logged in setup complete now you have

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:53,489
your own private server so you click on

00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:55,949
the button that says install apps and

00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:57,269
you see our page of apps these are all

00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:58,580
the apps which you can install with one

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:01,519
click

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,130
there is a matrix server for chat there

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,990
is an icky wiki server for a blog

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,779
OpenVPN you can run a tor relay you can

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,760
run a calendar tons of things and we

00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:13,519
also have system options like backups

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,399
and like configuring a free sub domain

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,380
at freedombox rocks so anybody here

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,019
could make their own sub domain using

00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,820
the settings with inner freedom box for

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,790
example if your name is Carter you could

00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:29,570
do Carter dot freedom box rocks as long

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:31,339
as that is available and here's an

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,980
example of what the installation process

00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:35,120
looks like if you want to install an IRC

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,829
client called quaza

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,300
you just go to the applications page and

00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:41,180
you click the install button and that's

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:44,120
it now here's what freedom box can do

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,910
here are some examples messaging matrix

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,279
and riot on freedom box can be used to

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:53,390
replace whatsapp here's a screenshot of

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:56,120
a real chat that I ran using a freedom

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,920
box that looks exactly like this I was

00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,839
running matrix on the freedom box and I

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,000
had three different client devices which

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,490
had the riot application running I had

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,860
two mobile phones in one desktop and

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,720
here's a chatroom akhil and Carol are

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,380
speaking with the admin and they even

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,329
decided to have a VoIP call another

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,399
application called sin thing can replace

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:18,350
cloud storage so now you can have in a

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,390
folder on your freedom box which

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,880
synchronizes its contents with that same

00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,329
folder on any client device that you

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,310
have

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:27,170
same thing I installed on same thing is

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,600
available on desktop it's available on

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,300
Android it's available on f-droid so

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,089
same thing is a real option for someone

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:38,660
who wants to have some file backup on

00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:40,310
their freedombox radical is a calendar

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,620
application that you can use to replace

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,899
Google Calendar I use radical every day

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,930
my calendar is hosted on my freedombox I

00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:50,060
have a smart phone which has the stock

00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:53,149
calendar app and the stock calendar app

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,459
is compatible with my freedombox

00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:57,500
calendar server there's no magic

00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,510
involved here it's pretty easy

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,880
Nikki wiki can replace centralized

00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,290
blogging this is what a Nikki wiki blog

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,790
looks like when it's right out of the

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,200
box but once you do a little bit of work

00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,820
and customize that you can make it look

00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,980
about as pretty as the freedombox

00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:13,250
foundation's website which is running on

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:16,760
a key wiki media wiki can replace

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:19,130
centralized teaching platforms it always

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,730
amazes me how easy it is to install an

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:26,390
encyclopedia onto your private server

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:28,160
one button and the good news is you can

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,350
actually buy a freedom box freedom box

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,300
is not just a free software system which

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:37,040
you can install on any hardware you want

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:39,500
it's also a product now elemex in April

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,230
launched the first-ever freedom box

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,680
project and here it is I'm holding it in

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,600
my hand it's made out of a lime two

00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,910
single board computer which has a gig of

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,290
ram and about a gigahertz in processing

00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:56,360
speed yesterday I heard Jon Maddog hall

00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,580
deliver a talk about his company kini

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,460
knows Lucas and he contrasted it with

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,670
the original Raspberry Pi he says that

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,310
the Raspberry Pi is slower than molasses

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,660
on a cold day you're not going to have

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,220
that problem with a single board

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,870
computer like this I use this every day

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,330
and I don't have any issues with it

00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,190
the case is a black metal with a laser

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,840
engraved freedombox logo and anyone who

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,990
wants to see it afterwards can come up

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,760
and see it we also have a battery inside

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,520
of the device which gives you five hours

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,910
of standalone operation if you ever have

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,190
a power outage I when I lived in the

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,350
Bronx New York for a year I used to have

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,630
frequent power outages and whenever you

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,980
have a power outage you worry that maybe

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,900
your server is going to have some data

00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,670
corruption in the process it's good to

00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,040
make it's good to have a server which

00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:44,260
doesn't shutdown whenever the power goes

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,360
off

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,690
and it also comes with a 32 gigabyte

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,010
micro SD card with some of the fastest

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,990
to read and write speeds that you can

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,340
find at this price point and of course

00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,039
that comes with the cables and right now

00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,100
are the costs is 82 euros or 93 US

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,080
dollars for the entire thing of course

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:06,850
you can also build your own freedom box

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,500
for around 50 US dollars using your own

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,299
materials that you buy or maybe that you

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,789
already have but this is an option that

00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:14,289
we made just so that it's easy for users

00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:18,789
who don't want to build their own

00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:21,610
freedom box with freedom box you can

00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:23,799
break up big tech the people in this

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,500
room you can start a movement to

00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:29,350
decentralize the web which will force

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,090
people or rather which will force big

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,190
tech to make it standards more

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,570
interoperable so they can compete with

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,769
the services that you are providing your

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:41,350
friends and some people argue that small

00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:43,779
can't replace big some argue that it's

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,760
impossible that a network of freedom

00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:51,519
boxes could ever overcome the might of

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:53,649
whatsapp well no one dreamed that the

00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,899
personal computer wants little more than

00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:58,419
a toy for hobbyists would displace the

00:19:55,899 --> 00:20:02,799
mighty mainframe that's what Tim woo

00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:04,690
says and as you all know the personal

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,370
computer did displace the mainframe most

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,330
people my age don't even know what a

00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:15,309
mainframe is personal computers

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:18,399
displaced mainframes personal servers

00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:20,200
can displace centralized servers but

00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:22,149
that's only if we do something about it

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,580
so let's make it happen with freedom box

00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:28,690
let's make it happen with Debian's own

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:31,389
private server system so what can you do

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,309
today well if you're inclined you can

00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:35,260
buy a freedom box and start using it you

00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:36,549
can make your own as well if you're

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,470
inclined you can donate to the

00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:41,490
freedombox foundation so that we can

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,710
continue to host our own infrastructure

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,799
you could also lead you can become a

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:49,830
network manager that is you can become a

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,870
volunteer who runs your own network of

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,120
freedom boxes for your local community

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,700
and what the freedombox foundation will

00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,500
give you in return is free consulting

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,809
free advice and maybe even free hardware

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,940
we have two network managers right now

00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,620
one is based at Yale Law School another

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,539
is based at Cornell Law School and

00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,179
they're using their freedom boxes to

00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:11,789
provide services to their legal

00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,289
communities we are open to anyone who

00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:16,860
wants to run a freedom box in any

00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:18,510
context talk to me I sent an email to

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,940
the foundation if you want to learn more

00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:25,830
about this there's the contact info

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,140
another thing that we need is code now

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:30,690
the real reason I travelled across the

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,270
hemisphere to deliver this talk is that

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:36,299
I knew that I would meet a lot of Debian

00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:38,760
developers in this room and we need more

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,320
Debian developers most of the developers

00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,240
for freedom box come directly from the

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,809
Debian community because we're a Debian

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,140
pure blend ah and it would be a really

00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:50,250
natural and logical next step for the

00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,760
people in this room to join our

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:55,590
community specifically in 2019 we're

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,230
trying to add an email server to the

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:00,240
freedombox system we're also thinking

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,190
about event management software so that

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,909
people can replace Facebook events and

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,679
Eventbrite and it's easier to organize

00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:09,630
political activity using event

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,630
management software and we're also

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,279
trying to package some Fetty vers social

00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,649
network applications something maybe

00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,529
like mastodons maybe somebody could help

00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:21,600
us try to package Mastodon for Debian

00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:22,640
that way it'd be really easy to put in

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,529
freedombox

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,679
if anybody here wants to help us with

00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:30,779
these or any other tasks please look us

00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,850
up find us on our forum on our IRC

00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:37,200
Channel join our community we really

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:39,630
really need you at this time so let's

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,730
break up big tech with small tech thank

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:46,440
you very much

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:51,040
[Applause]

00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:53,880
okay here are my citations and now we

00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,880
can move on to some questions

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,330
you know maybe I miss it but what

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,730
architecture is it running on that

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,019
specific hardware and in general sorry

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,700
could you I couldn't hear you could just

00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:19,610
answer the mic okay I think it's on now

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,139
maybe I think it's okay now right I

00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,240
think people should use it so which

00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:26,809
architecture is it running is it amd64

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,090
our arm and then specific this box that

00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:31,159
you just showed it can run so this is

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:34,149
arm but it can run on anything that

00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,149
Debian can run on

00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:54,549
so small follow-up to previous questions

00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:56,919
so let's assume that I don't want to run

00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:59,289
pure freedom box but I already have some

00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:02,679
Debian computers so how easy it would be

00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:04,720
to install applications in similar way

00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,779
that freedom box runs to have some

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,929
compatibility or to be able to provide

00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:13,149
you feedback if something is wrong okay

00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:14,980
so you're asking how easy would it be to

00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:18,340
install freedom box on an existing

00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,320
Debian installation or just some of the

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,510
apps yes just some of the apps okay

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,340
so if you want to install just some of

00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,980
the apps on an existing Debian

00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,049
installation then it will it should be

00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,789
very easy to make those interoperate

00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:32,590
with the apps on somebody else's freedom

00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:34,779
box and that's because they're running

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,539
the same packages so if you want to

00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:39,399
install a matrix server on some old

00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:41,230
Debian laptop without installing freedom

00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:43,330
box on it then just install all the

00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,440
packages that freedom box installs which

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,960
should be easy because they're all from

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,940
Debian and then from there we're pretty

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,940
much operating in the in the same realm

00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,850
so are you providing a poster or some

00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:01,960
virtual packages to install all that's

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:05,710
needed so I don't have to hunt for which

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,270
packages are you installing well right

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,070
so if you want more information about

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,779
what what packages were installing

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,870
what's bundled within the system you can

00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:15,610
go to our wiki its wiki Debian org slash

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:20,559
freedom box and you'll see a very

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:22,230
extensive manual yeah ok another thing

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,360
is that when you install applications

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,450
within the freedombox system above the

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,370
status bar it actually flashes the text

00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,990
of the individual packages that are

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,640
being downloaded and installed as

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,140
they're being installed so that's

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,350
another way to kind of look under the

00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,269
hood and see exactly what you're getting

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,070
so another follow-up question to that

00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:43,080
you mentioned that freedombox is a pure

00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,210
plant so are you actually implementing

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,710
the apps as task packages or something

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,860
or is that some freedombox specific

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,990
thing the way that you bundle apps into

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,690
probably Debian packages and some

00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:57,210
configuration or can you elaborate on

00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:59,970
how the app install is different to an

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:03,889
app get install basically well it's the

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,889
same it's the same okay so same

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,249
at least the last time I looked at it

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,669
there was a package called plinth that

00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:20,830
has basically the configuration GUI and

00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:22,600
and basically they've written a system

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,909
management interface which is again

00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:28,990
since its Debian pure blend it's part of

00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:31,120
Debian that makes that allows you to do

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,220
the there basically makes Debian easier

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,549
to use for that community

00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:38,110
and you know you can go take you can go

00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:39,070
take a look at the source of that or go

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,110
take a look at it running on the

00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:43,110
freedombox image thanks

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,169
yeah I think I was just basically asking

00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:52,639
whether there's a one-shot package you

00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:55,159
would install on the hood or is there

00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:56,960
like a set of packages but never mind um

00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,159
I have another maybe more controversial

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,049
question so okay

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,309
you mentioned the Xero merger box by the

00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:03,289
Bush administration

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:05,600
do you have any data on how much the

00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:07,159
Obama administration actually blocked

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,889
because I'm not sure how much better it

00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:12,620
was in the end yeah so the question is

00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:14,720
if the Bush administration did

00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,610
absolutely nothing about antitrust what

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,980
about the Obama administration they had

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,200
eight years in office as well there is

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,240
data about that I don't have it I know

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,250
that they did do more than the Bush

00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,919
administration however it still wasn't

00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:31,039
enough because the Obama administration

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,799
also operated under the same myth the

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,769
myth that big that tech moves quickly

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:39,350
that there is a five-year cycle of

00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:41,419
companies rising and falling and so

00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:43,340
that's why even after we had somebody

00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:46,789
who believed in antitrust to take office

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:49,330
it wasn't enough that myth was still so

00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:49,330
powerful

00:27:56,349 --> 00:28:04,809
we have seen this year also movement

00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:08,169
from from IRA's trip to like children as

00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:10,649
they say trusted services and service

00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:13,570
that don't spy on users how do you see

00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:15,729
this relationship between having

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:19,029
everyone have their own feeding box at

00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:20,739
home and having companies providing

00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:25,119
services for maybe a larger set of

00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:27,849
people okay then you could reasonably

00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,639
host on a single freedombox for Isis so

00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:33,099
the question is if I if I heard it right

00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:36,039
right now there are some more trusted

00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:38,289
services that are emerging and they're

00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:41,619
supposed to be an alternative to Google

00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:44,139
Drive for example what would I say if

00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:46,089
somebody asked me should I use this new

00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,279
trusted service which is hosted on

00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:52,509
someone else's servers or should I run

00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:55,149
it on a freedombox my stance still is

00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:57,969
that if given a choice you should run it

00:28:55,149 --> 00:29:01,330
on a freedom box because you control the

00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:04,719
data you control the logs one of the the

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:06,909
reasons relates to the way that the law

00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:09,940
works in the United States in the United

00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:13,929
States you have a Fourth Amendment right

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:17,019
to have some some privacy to materials

00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:18,849
which are in your own home so if you

00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:21,729
have a freedom box server in your own

00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:23,559
home and law enforcement wants to get to

00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:25,119
it they need a warrant they need a

00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:28,570
warrant to enter your home and then get

00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,489
to the freedombox if instead that same

00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:33,309
data is being hosted on somebody else's

00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:35,440
servers the law enforcement isn't going

00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:36,639
to need a warrant the same kind of

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,679
warrant to get to it so it'll be easier

00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:41,080
now they can have some sort of data

00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,450
sharing agreement with that company so

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,309
that they can look through the data now

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,799
these companies which are trying to

00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:50,049
provide trusted services are trying to

00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,789
find ways around that but at least in

00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:54,909
the u.s. the safest way to have your own

00:29:51,789 --> 00:30:01,210
data safe is to keep it in your own home

00:29:54,909 --> 00:30:03,700
and another reason why I still really

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,320
think that we should be using freedom

00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,549
boxes instead of these centralized

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,600
trusted alternatives

00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:14,749
is that they solve the problem of a

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,879
centralized web what good will these

00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:19,999
trusted services be if they're still

00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:22,669
just as centralized as the status quo if

00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:25,190
we have all of these if mean if Matt

00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:26,929
mastodon would be great if everybody on

00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,429
Twitter moved to Mastodon but it would

00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:31,070
be even better if everybody on Twitter

00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:33,440
moved to 1,000 different Mastodon

00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:35,840
instances so I think that we should

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,720
still strive to spread our digital

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,029
assets as widely as we can because when

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,519
we put them in one place and then

00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:45,289
they're all running on the same software

00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,269
and when there's one bug that affects

00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:49,820
that one software system then it affects

00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:52,789
everybody's data one of the reasons why

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,379
Linux is is considered social Security's

00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:55,999
that people are running so many

00:30:54,379 --> 00:30:58,279
different distributions that if there's

00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:59,419
some zero day that somebody finds it's

00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,889
unlikely that's that it's going to

00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:02,269
affect everybody running a Linux

00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:04,909
distribution there are so many of them

00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:06,950
and so if you want to spread everybody's

00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:08,809
digital assets in a safe way let's have

00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,700
an ecosystem of different private server

00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:12,679
systems there will be freedom box over

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,999
here why you know host over there and a

00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:15,409
bunch of other ones and now it's going

00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:18,590
to be even harder to take all of them

00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:20,769
down at the same time hope that answers

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,769
your question

00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:27,859
how about data encryption I can't

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:30,499
imagine how to boot one of these things

00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:33,350
up and enter a password but I like it to

00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:34,609
be all encrypted yeah yeah good question

00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,259
so the question is what about encryption

00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:38,029
now I'm not a developer and I don't

00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:39,440
specialize in any of this so all I can

00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,600
tell you is the current status the

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,179
current status is that we do not yet

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,149
support full disk encryption there isn't

00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:48,470
yet full disk encryption but there are

00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:50,929
other security measures that we take

00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:53,470
that you can look look through on our on

00:31:50,929 --> 00:32:04,059
our web on our wiki and on our website

00:31:53,470 --> 00:32:06,460
I I thank you for your talk very

00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:09,520
interesting project congratulations the

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:13,659
motivation of it inspires at least

00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:15,010
inspires me a lot and the package seems

00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:16,809
seems pretty I would like to see it

00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,370
afterwards I would like to ask you a

00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,679
little bit more about the the network

00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,210
managers thing you said yeah connecting

00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,940
to the previous question that your

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,549
previous answer what how does it work in

00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,530
terms of trying to spread this trying to

00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:31,840
create a network if I understood it

00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:34,299
right you are also trying to create a

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,210
network of freedom boxers I mean to try

00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:38,530
to use the system to spread this idea of

00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,820
distributing things how are you

00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:42,460
connecting this you said there are two

00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,260
to play with them yeah so the question

00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,600
is how are we going to connect all of

00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,059
these network managers so right now the

00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:52,330
goal is not to make each network manager

00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:54,190
Fedder a twith the other one so our two

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,200
network managers at Yale and Cornell as

00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,909
far as I know none of their services are

00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,640
federated together they're actually just

00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,049
serving their local communities and they

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,370
have more than one freedom box that are

00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:09,400
running together you have something that

00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,990
connects them to you because you know we

00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,299
don't know that's a great question let

00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,950
me clarify so the question now is aren't

00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:16,780
all of these network managers connected

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,870
to us at the freedombox foundation and

00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:22,150
the answer is no and that's because they

00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:25,090
run all the software on their own and

00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,679
they host it on their own server which

00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:29,620
we don't see we don't touch we don't

00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,450
know about we don't gather usage data we

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,070
don't gather statistics about how many

00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,200
downloads there are of our image that's

00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,340
why I can't tell you how many thousands

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,960
of freedom boxes there are in the world

00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,580
oh we don't want to know how many

00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,669
freedom boxes there are because we want

00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:44,380
you to have that information private and

00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:46,600
so this is a really important point that

00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,549
III get asked about at conferences a lot

00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,710
what good is freedom box if it's just

00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:52,630
gonna be the next Google umm well the

00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,950
good news is we can't be because we

00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,530
don't control your data at all it's like

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,789
if I sell you a Swiss Army knife you can

00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,770
do what you want with it I'll never see

00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:02,410
I don't know

00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:04,510
yeah sorry I don't know if I'm getting

00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,730
too much time this is a simple question

00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:12,000
in terms of hardware what what do you

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:15,700
have inside that box mostly so so if

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,460
this is running a lime to single board

00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:21,550
computer it's made by a company called

00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,530
all MX all MX makes open-source hardware

00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:27,669
that's what we wanted to do a deal with

00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:30,610
them you can also run a Raspberry Pi 2

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:32,919
you can also run boards made by Pine 64

00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,409
or the the banana Pro there are there

00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:36,940
are all sorts of them but in case you

00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:39,720
don't know a single board computer is

00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,379
basically it's it's just all the

00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,780
material that you need to have a

00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:45,790
computer condense down to one board you

00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,129
can imagine a smartphone from 2012

00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:55,690
that's basically what this is except

00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:57,580
without the screen on it yeah good

00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,320
question no we don't we used to have own

00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,330
cloud on it back when it was a debian

00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,890
package but we don't have next cloud

00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:05,380
because next cloud is not a debian

00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:07,660
package that's one of the drawbacks of

00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,359
being a W in pure blend I've spoken with

00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:13,090
the folks the higher ups at next cloud

00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,710
and they're enthusiastic about

00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,410
freedombox and next cloud coming

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,840
together but they aren't so enthusiastic

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:22,030
about making next cloud into a debian

00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,650
package because that represents a set of

00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:26,050
commitments that I don't think they're

00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:28,359
ready to make so if somebody here wants

00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,310
to package next cloud for Debian you'll

00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,540
do the world a great service because now

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:38,050
we can make it a freedombox package

00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:41,710
because if you you you need such a cloud

00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:44,470
service to store your perfect data in in

00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:48,700
your hand so it would be the small

00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:50,770
computer would be too small it's like 32

00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,790
geek you have there yeah good question

00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:56,290
so the question is isn't the freedombox

00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:58,390
gonna be too small to host all your

00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:01,240
private data well it depends on how much

00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,530
your data you're trying to host and it

00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,290
depends on what you're using for storage

00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:06,940
so this has a 32 gigabyte SD card in it

00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,770
it is going to be too small to host all

00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,200
of my music but what I could do is use

00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:12,670
the SATA port to plug in an external

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,109
hard drive

00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:18,430
sit that right next to the freedombox so

00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:22,119
now it does have the storage do you know

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:24,520
if freedombox cool run on candy nose'

00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:27,160
locals or have you ever try or someone

00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,470
in the team developing freedombox have

00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,270
ever tried running on kirino's locals

00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:33,180
yeah so the question is what about Kenny

00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:35,980
knows leuco scant freedombox run on that

00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,200
the answer is we haven't tested it yet

00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,059
but probably and the reason I say

00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,980
probably is that Caminos glucoses being

00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:43,839
targeted for debian specifically they're

00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,760
trying to make debian fully compatible

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,410
with it and if debian is fully

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,059
compatible with it then freedombox will

00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:54,010
be I would love to work with the fine

00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:57,069
ladies and gentlemen of Caminos Lucas to

00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:58,240
deliver freedombox to Brazil if they

00:36:57,069 --> 00:37:02,740
want to work with us we'll work with

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,930
them what about updates we have this

00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:11,109
tiny little box and it's doing how to

00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:13,390
update so yeah good question so what

00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:16,270
about updates there are two things to

00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:18,579
say here this gets automatic security

00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:20,410
updates whenever they are pushed and

00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:21,849
they're pushed from the upstream Debian

00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:24,040
packages so we don't have to control

00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:26,079
that ourselves and that is true of the

00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,930
stable images that testing the unstable

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,930
the experimental arm and there is also a

00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:33,670
page where you can manually click the

00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,099
Update button and see if there are any

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,450
new updates to any of your packages one

00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:41,740
more point I want to make about updates

00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:43,059
is if your this will be obvious to a lot

00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,220
of the people in the room but if you're

00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:47,230
running the stable image then you're not

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:50,260
going to be getting the latest updates

00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:52,210
that we're pushing to our testing branch

00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,040
if you're running the testing image then

00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:56,280
you're going to be getting new software

00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,339
features once every two weeks actually

00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:03,700
now we did enable back ports on the

00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:06,430
latest buster stable release which means

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,619
that hopefully we can push some new

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,290
features into even the stable versions

00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,819
on a regular basis but generally your

00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,180
software if you're running the stable

00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:17,410
image your software should look pretty

00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,680
normal shouldn't change at all for about

00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,680
two years

00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:25,980
how does freedombox handle when a new

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,530
Devon release is made for instance if I

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,110
had a freedom box a couple of months ago

00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:33,660
for any stretch what does how do I have

00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:38,370
ready to Buster does it work did anybody

00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:40,110
try it yeah so it depends yeah so this

00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:41,730
is a complicated question and I'm not I

00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,170
don't have a great answer for it because

00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:47,070
we're actually still working it out

00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:49,860
right now if your freedom box is set to

00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:51,360
get its software from the testing

00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:55,020
repository then it'll continue to run

00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:58,770
testing but if it's pointed at buster

00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,450
then once Buster went stable people

00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:03,900
needed to manually SSH into their

00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:07,200
freedom box and I answer a prompt which

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,910
said I do you approve of the upgrade

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,720
from testing this table and they had to

00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:16,740
enter Y for yes and then and it updated

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,290
to the latest table image unfortunately

00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,580
that was an oversight we we could have

00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:24,210
avoided that we could have made a

00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:27,000
frictionless update from I buster

00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:30,510
testing to Buster stable but that was a

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,610
mistake sir our developers made no what

00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:34,260
I meant was from from the previous table

00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:36,750
to the current stable so we're running

00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,570
stretch and then buzzer lizard and I

00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:42,390
want to run debian stable then you were

00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,890
stable because I'm not sure why you're

00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:50,340
doing this but nobody should be running

00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:52,290
servers on testing yeah I think so yeah

00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,700
when you say that that was a mistake

00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,220
your developers made no that was a

00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,400
mistake we as a community made we I

00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:01,590
think there were many of us who were a

00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,240
little bit surprised release morning or

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,380
release you know next day release

00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:08,580
morning to get that little message

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:11,220
prompt and I think this is an area where

00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:14,040
we is Debian need to do a little bit

00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:18,600
better testing of changes in a certain

00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:21,900
area and I think that your story is an

00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,000
excellent illustration of how Debian has

00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,790
some really great testing but we need to

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,410
even have better testing around things

00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,930
that affect the archive like that so

00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:32,140
that your developers had some chance of

00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:35,560
being aware

00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:38,380
thank you if anyone has more questions

00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,640
about that issue please direct it to our

00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:46,930
forum or our mailing list

00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:49,480
I think we're thank you very much for a

00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:52,330
very very interesting presentation just

00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,430
one of the finest say many thanks for

00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,740
actually going to pure blend of the way

00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,210
and not having third-party repositories

00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,160
and doing it in Debian I think that's

00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,460
very much appreciated thanks a lot for

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:09,969
all your work thank you

00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:09,969
