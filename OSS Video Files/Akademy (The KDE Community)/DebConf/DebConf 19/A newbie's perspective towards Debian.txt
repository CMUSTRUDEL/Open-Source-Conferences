https://debconf19.debconf.org/talks/28-a-newbies-perspective-towards-debian/

This is mostly a journey talk, where I talk about why I took the "Debian
road" and how the meaning of Debian evolved over months for me.

From the technical things to the philosophical side, expiating the horrible
mistakes I made all the way, I share the story of a 19 y/o who, with no
prior experience in Ruby, JavaScript, Golang, and Perl, helped in over 200+
packages and became the youngest Debian Maintainer in India in less than 90
days.

With this, I hope other new people would get on-board with the Debian
project :)

00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,920
took a Debian road and how the meaning

00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,240
of Debian evolved Erlich months for him

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,189
he's covering a technical to the

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,790
philosophical and all the horrible

00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:27,619
mistakes hopefully not too many he's

00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:32,450
with no prior experience in Ruby

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,160

00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,960
class packages that became the youngest

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,859
event maintainer in India in less than

00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,769
90 days

00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:45,530
I hope this'll be as exciting hello

00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:50,839
welcome to a new beasts perspective

00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:53,059
towards Debian so Who am I I am a 19

00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:55,760
year old Evan maintainer I'm also a

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,489
second year undergraduate student and

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,140
I'm a community dot programmer and I

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:02,839
also contribute to a couple of open

00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,269
source projects I'm a PSF member and a

00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:08,210
contributor I am also doing gee sock

00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,710
with Debian this year and I go by the

00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,160
handle of gosh two one zero two across

00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:15,650
the web and in my free time I love

00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,930
poking my Linux system and it loves

00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,690
poking me back

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:23,270
well why this talk that's kind of a

00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,920
funny story I mean I don't know why I

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,620
submitted this talk enough in the very

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,200
first place but then I mostly forgot

00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,050
about forgot about the stock until I

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,190
received the acceptance mail and it

00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:40,430
really freaked me out so when I went to

00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:42,770
cancel this talk a wise man told me who

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:47,240
goes by the handle terzilio he told me

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:49,880
that for anyone who's a new comer here

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,900
and he starts going to be in Debian it's

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,050
already a win so yeah and that's the

00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,050
hope

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:03,960
[Applause]

00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:07,750
okay so there is no reason well that was

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:11,020
solely because things went haywire with

00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,800
me I mean that's actually where it all

00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,980
started

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,040
so I was in my first year of

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,240
undergraduation and I started

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,280
contributing a couple of open-source

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,070
projects mostly because open source was

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,280
a thing back in India and it still

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,890
pretty much is and so yeah but then

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,470
hoping hopping from one project to

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,150
another didn't really benefit me much

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,330
because you know doing a couple of dog

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,950
fixes and adding or subtracting a couple

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,840
of imports in Python doesn't really

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,780
count does it

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,180
so yeah and weirdly enough other sectors

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,260
of my life like a car makes friendships

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:53,470
relationships everything were slipping -

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,320
so who helped well I was in kind of a

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,360
mess so I went to a therapist and she

00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,640
did help a bit

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,430
later I met Raju

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,930
he's about to be a DD now this gentleman

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,989
sitting right here

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:14,620
he offered help for making me contribute

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:17,140
to Debian so after we started talking we

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,480
decided to install Debian and back then

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,360
I was an arch linux user mostly but

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,680
again because arsenic's was a team I

00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,840
guess still is anyway so he helped me

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,200
learn packaging and helped me in knowing

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:37,090
Debian in a much better way so after a

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:40,360
couple of days I moved to IRC and then I

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:43,540
met the pirate Praveen I don't know who

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,620
all know him but then if you know him

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:50,110
you would know what I mean so so I he

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,560
helped me in reviewing all my packages

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:56,170
and we can we conversed for you know

00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,540
hours and hours each day every day and

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,959
so by the end of the first month and a

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,390
half I had done over 84 packages working

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:08,769
14 hours a day solely because I needed

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:10,960
escapism well also I got to know yard

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,600
his name is Xavier he

00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,090
well everyone knows how horrifying or

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,000
terrible JavaScript can get but then

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,859
this man got my back he helped me fixing

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,860
all the test failures and with their

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:27,370
help I saw the good amount of bugs and I

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,500
learned sysadmin skills etc it was

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,410
adventurous but I did commit horrible

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,230
mistakes and that's where the

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:39,670
philosophically site comes into play

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:42,730
well it started when I was asked to you

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,280
know back up my GPG keys and I uploaded

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:52,030
my master private GPT key to the Google

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:54,820
cloud so then then you know

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,850
pravin told me the significance of GPG

00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:01,750
and give me gave me a good lesson and a

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:07,750
lecture and then i learn of course about

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:09,580
GPG significance and also and also from

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,830
there the meaning of Debian changed I

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,500
mean I learned why Debian is different

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,930
for from other operating systems and how

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,220
they've been values its users and its

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:23,470
policy so and finally I was told I mean

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,500
after learning all these things I he

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,229
made me go through DFS G guidelines

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,930
social contract and other Debian

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:34,180
policies and finally when when I had and

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,000
I was prepared he told me I could apply

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,100
to be a DM and that was my 71st day of

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,600
contributing when I became contributing

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:46,570
to Debian well we had a mini Def Con in

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,630
Delhi where you know pravin right here

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,430
and shruti and other people were there

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,380
and of course we had the key signing

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:58,900
party that was needed for me to become a

00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:02,160
DM whoo and as a result I became the

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:06,160
Debian youngest a pin maintainer India I

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,560
solved more bugs and fix some CVS upload

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,590
in my own packages sponsored a few I

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,290
also got the opportunity to do G sock on

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,900
the Debian and more and most importantly

00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:22,029
I got a chance to attend that
