This is mostly a journey talk, where I talk about why I took the "Debian
road" and how the meaning of Debian evolved over months for me.

From the technical things to the philosophical side, expiating the horrible
mistakes I made all the way, I share the story of a 19 y/o who, with no
prior experience in Ruby, JavaScript, Golang, and Perl, helped in over 200+
packages and became the youngest Debian Maintainer in India in less than 90
days.

With this, I hope other new people would get on-board with the Debian
project :)
