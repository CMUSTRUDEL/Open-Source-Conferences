During the DPL campaign, there was discussion of two related issues.  First, we discussed moving our packaging to Git repositories on salsa.debian.org presumably as a matter of policy.  Second we discussed moving away from source packages and to a model where `git push` is used to upload packages.
This is a requirements collecting BOF for that discussion.  We'll discuss what people would like out of such and experience, how we might meet those requirements, and problems meeting the requirements.
Deciding whether to make this changes is out of scope: that belongs on our mailing lists.  But if we were going to do it, what would people want?  That belongs here.
Requirements will be conflicting.  Choosing which conflicting requirements to meet is out of scope beyond noting the conflict.  This is a brainstorming session.
