Have you already heard about Open Educational Resources (OER)? Do you know how an Open License works? In this talk, we will discuss those topics and learn more about why those things are so important for education. This talk is built for anyone who wants to get more involved with open education and wish to apply its concepts for any material under open licenses.

We will take a brief look at the history of the Open Educational Resources and the open licenses (specifically Creative Commons), we will discuss the results of a survey with future teachers about their previous knowledge about OER and Open licenses, and we will talk about how we can change this scenario.

thanks for mozilla for bringing me here

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:53,269
I am a Mozilla volunteer as I will say

in a few minutes and I will talk today

00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:57,739
about open licenses and open educational

00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,280
resources and why we should care about

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,640
it

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:05,360
so before we start English is not my

00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,090
first language so if you are try to add

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,070
a lot of text to my slides so if you

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,680
don't understand something I say maybe

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,470
you can find the same text in this light

00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,210
and you can understand better this is

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,770
the third time I'm doing a talk in

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:24,050
English so please be kind to me this is

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,640
easy when I'm doing Portuguese but it's

00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,630
really hard when I am doing in English

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,800
and before we start I want to say Who am

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,480
I so I am a professor I work at Fatah ki

00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,990
Fateh ech is a university or a college

00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,990
in a small town called taka teaching in

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,080
some Paulo state and I am a web

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:50,360
developer and a mozillian I started

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:52,730
working with web development in 2006 at

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,130
least getting paid for doing stuff like

00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,070
before that I do some stuff for the web

00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:03,470
but I don't receive money so my first

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:05,390
web site was made in 2001 in 2014 or

00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,820
five years ago I joined the Mozilla

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,009
community and I started teaching at the

00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,720
same time so I started working as a

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:15,230
professor at the same time I joined

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,640
Mozilla I work it inside Mozilla in a

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,840
lot of different projects like web maker

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,880
was a project to bring more people to

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,360
the web to know how they can develop

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,880
things they can work in the web I joined

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,550
some time during I also helped it with

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,890
the Mozilla campus clubs and Mozilla

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,750
clubs another program to be bring more

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:41,820
people to the web environment and in

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,890
2017 I became a Mozilla tech speaker

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,950
that Mozilla tech speaker is a program

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:51,690
that Mozilla developed to give training

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,970
and tools for speakers so they can talk

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,120
about Mozilla and technologies that

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,610
Mozilla supports in event so I'm here

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,070
today because Mozilla is funding me to

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,830
be here helping me to travel from my

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:08,040
city to here and Kosmo Zillah gives me a

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,440
lot of technologies and stuff during

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,239
those time that I am a tech speaker so

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,450
it's really nice to be a tech speaker

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:19,739
and it's a really nice to be a mozillian

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:23,130
and one year ago I started a master's in

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,739
education so I am researching about open

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,590
educational resources and open license

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,830
at my Master's so this is basically what

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,590
I am doing I try to combine two things I

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,920
use a lot like I talked about a lot open

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,489
licenses because of Mozilla usually I do

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,180
talks about web PR and virtual reality

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:51,810
that's my field outside of the masters

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:54,900
but I tried to bring what I use commonly

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,390
in my daily basis as a tech speaker and

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,950
what I'm doing master's to be something

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:04,200
like more enjoyable to me for the events

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,610
and people will participate during the

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,100
research so for we start I want to say

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,650
that we have to be clear about education

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,859
is about sharing so if there's no

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,169
sharing happening there is no education

00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:21,780
no education happening teachers share

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:24,060
their knowledge and skills with students

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,300
and students share their questions and

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,190
drafts with teachers we have a similar

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,099
process where students share knowledge

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,770
with

00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:35,319
teachers also I believe that it's a

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,080
two-way road so we learn and with each

00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:40,869
at the same time those teachers share

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,990
feedback Critias and encouragement with

00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:45,909
their students and oh it and on it goes

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,369
so basically when we talk about

00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:51,520
education we are talking about sharing

00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:55,210
we are talking about sharing experiences

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,419
and sharing knowledge in when we talk

00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:02,199
about open education it's a term that

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:06,129
gained a lot of strange in the last

00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:08,110
decade so various sectors of society has

00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:11,259
internet in digital technologies

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,839
advances started to talking about open

00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:16,749
education and to provide open education

00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:19,539
and open education seeks to promote the

00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:22,959
freedom to use change combined and

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:25,479
redistribute educational resources from

00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,729
the use of open technologies so the

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,339
concept also involves principles related

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:33,459
to open pedagogical practice so it's not

00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:36,610
only technology it's involved practice

00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:39,749
as well so we need that professors and

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,399
teachers they know that we can use open

00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:44,289
pedagogical practice to involve more the

00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:49,169
students and to share their work with

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:51,610
more people and open education movement

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:53,379
involves the search for alternatives to

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,599
some of the obvious barriers to the

00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,550
right to quality education and it's

00:05:55,599 --> 00:06:01,149
aligned to the 40 United Nations

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,180
sustainable development NGO it's one of

00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:07,959
the most important things from to the

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,620
United Nations is the openness access to

00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:13,509
quality education so using open

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,930
education we can promote that we can

00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:20,379
help to promote open a quality education

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,169
for everyone and when we talk about open

00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:25,389
education we are also talking about open

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:28,110
educational resources this is the logo

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:32,800
from the open educational resources and

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:36,300
the foundation of open education are the

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,069
open educational resources so our

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,469
materials and stuff like that that we

00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,350
use like resources that we are free of

00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,720
course

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,360
and access barriers and we chose to pair

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,640
lego permissions for open news so we can

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,860
use the open educational resources in

00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,270
your practice and we can share those

00:06:51,860 --> 00:07:00,910
content with all people the o er can be

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:04,880
books book chapters software video games

00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,920
reviews papers manuals videos almost

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,380
anything you think about can be a open

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,280
educational resource if you add with

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:15,560
open license so the main idea of the OE

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,440
R is that any learning resource that a

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,960
person publishes can be used it and

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,080
recombine by other people in different

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,950
way as a way of expanding knowledge so

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,170
if you like you make a class you know a

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,940
material for a class and you want to

00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,580
share with other professors or teachers

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:38,540
you can add an open license and make

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,900
this we are and when we talk about open

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,540
licensing we are generally the

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,880
permissions is granted that using one of

00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,070
the open licenses so Creative Commons is

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,040
one of the best examples of those

00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:54,770
licenses which aloes anyone to freely

00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,500
use adapt and share the resource anytime

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,450
anywhere in open permissions are

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,270
typically defined in terms of the five

00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:05,540
hours it's common to see references to

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,980
four hours also probably you know some

00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,000
of them because of the four freedoms

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:13,640
they are similar so the fire the five

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,250
hours activities first one retained the

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,710
right to make own and control copies of

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,190
the content like download duplicate star

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:24,470
and manage those Oh a ours the second

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,200
one they reused the right to use the

00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,560
content in a wide range of ways in a

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,810
class in a study group on a website in a

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,800
video if we think about top right in

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:39,680
Brazil for example you can use text

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,680
inside the class if you read the

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,980
copyright in their food terms they have

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,040
some briefs or they have some space for

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,010
like use something for education it's

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,710
very very cloudy and you can't see what

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,750
exactly you can do or you can do using

00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,280
our open it

00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,830
when you using our open educational

00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,930
resources this change because the outer

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,950
give you the permission to do that

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,530
or to use those material the third one

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,350
is revised the right to adapt edges

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,940
modify or alter the content itself like

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,250
translate the content in another

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,630
language I believe this is one of the

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:21,220
best of one of the best uses of open

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,370
educational resources you can have a

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,290
good content in English or in Spanish or

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,750
in any other language and you can

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,060
translate our local language and use

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,470
like a language that are more accessible

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:38,920
to your students or the people will join

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:41,140
or use those educational resources the

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,300
right to remix the right to convene the

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,220
region our revised it content with order

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,560
material to create something new like

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,940
incorporate the content into a mashup

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,650
and the last one is redistribute the

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,500
right to share copies of the original

00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:59,320
content your revisions or euro mixes

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,660
with others so give a copy of the

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,930
content program to a friend so it's very

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,820
similar that we use in software like the

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,400
freedoms of the open educational

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,620
resources that are similar to the ones

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,890
you already know from the four freedoms

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,230
in the software but here we are talking

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,890
only about content so the Creative

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:24,910
Commons will help us to bring more

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:27,430
openness to those contents so how can I

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,880
have my material under the five hours

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:33,160
that discuss it here you can use the

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,800
Creative Commons for example so when we

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,730
share everyone wins

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,030
Creative Commons is a nonprofit

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,980
organization that allows the sharing and

00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:45,430
the use of creative and knowledge to

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,620
feel free legal strohman Creative

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,350
Commons licenses they are not contrary

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,830
to copyright they are they work in

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,170
addition to copyright to in allow you to

00:10:53,830 --> 00:11:00,040
modify your copyright terms to best suit

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,560
your needs so if people share a material

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,779
in the web and they don't add licenses

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,120
it's by default copyright so

00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:12,139
use those materials and remix those

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,560
metier and creative commons brings a lot

00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:17,779
of terms and helps to us when we want to

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,060
share something and we want to give

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:22,160
permissions to people to use our content

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,579
and to share this content with other

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,879
people keeping or not the same license

00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:31,879
we will talk about that because for

00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:34,639
technical choices make open content less

00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:38,660
open so we can have open content that's

00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,850
not so much open like half open or we

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:45,589
can improve the openness of accountant

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:49,100
if we take a close look to some choices

00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:52,699
we made during the material building

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:56,029
process for that we have the Elms

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:58,399
analysis they've really developed the

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:02,089
Elms analysis as a framework for

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,430
thinking about this technical aspects of

00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:07,970
localization Elms is an acronym that

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:11,110
stands for access to editing tools level

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,879
of expertise required to revise or remix

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:17,720
meaningfully editable and source file

00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:20,120
access so what is access to editing

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,220
tools we have to ask is the open content

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,910
publishing a format that can only be

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,129
revised or remix it using those that are

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,029
streaming lis expensive for example

00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:34,639
someone built a nice poster or stuff

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:38,689
like that in Illustrator from the dog

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:41,540
you have to pay to remix this this

00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:45,079
document may be the outer want to make

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:48,050
it open but use it a closet format so

00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:51,050
you have to pay to edit this document so

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:53,629
we have to ask if this is really open is

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,569
the open content publishing an adopted

00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:59,360
format that can only be revised or mix

00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:02,089
it using tools that run on an obscure or

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,970
its continent platform maybe you use a

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:07,309
software that doesn't it doesn't exist

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,649
anymore and you share it as an open

00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:11,959
content but people will have to find

00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:13,250
those as object software to edit your

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,620
content to

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:20,360
make changes and edit the stuff you

00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:22,579
share also is the open content

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,709
publishing afirma that can be revised or

00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:27,399
mix using tools that are freely

00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:30,439
available and run on all major platforms

00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,439
so maybe you build a presentation like

00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:36,680
this one and you use it PowerPoint for

00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:38,930
example people will have problem to it

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,290
those present the this presentation you

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,209
built because it's not a software that

00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:47,720
are available and run on all major

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:51,439
platforms probably with LaBrie FC and

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:54,439
Open Office II you will get almost the

00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:56,540
same sensation when you open the the

00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:59,750
content the first time but it's not

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,819
really really open you have to adjust

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,370
something maybe you have to change a

00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:06,680
font you have to change some the size of

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:10,009
stuff that will break because of the

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,829
conversion and when we talk about the

00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:14,720
level of expertise required so is the

00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,910
open content publishing afirma that

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,279
requires a significant amount of

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,809
technical expertise to revise or remix

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:26,660
sometimes this is not how can I say

00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:29,600
maybe you build like blender model and

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,029
people who want to change this blender

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,829
model will have to know blender I have

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:36,740
to know the software who have to make

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:41,329
have skills using that software to make

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:43,209
meaningful changes to that material but

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:45,920
sometimes this is innovative in

00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,720
inevitable so you can do anything you

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,899
have to use blender or you have to use

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,689
that software to build this but if you

00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:56,569
can you have to prefer to use something

00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:59,240
that are easy to maintain easy to change

00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:00,949
is to use so is the open content

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,620
publishing a format that requires a

00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:06,079
minimal level of technical spare ties to

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,220
revise or remix for example if you build

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,949
a text and share you know like using a

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,319
text editor you can change the text and

00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:17,209
make changes to do those open

00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:19,339
educational resources with no problem

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:22,459
you don't have to be an expert about

00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:24,920
technology to change anything in a text

00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:27,900
document

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,850
so it's the open content publishing in a

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,920
manner that makes its content

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,170
essentially impossible to revise or

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,620
remix so maybe you want to share

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:40,710
something but you use a scanned image of

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,560
a document people will not be able to

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:46,020
remix those document they have to write

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,880
all again using another software and

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,790
then they can abuse the content and then

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,110
make changes so is the open content

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,320
publishing in a manner making its

00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,870
contents easy to revise or mix and set

00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,870
sample a text file it's something easy

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:04,400
that anyone can go there and make

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:07,740
changes and redistribute those changes

00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,740
and when we talk about self sources is

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,110
the format preferred for consuming the

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,080
open content the same format preferred

00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:20,310
for revising or mixes the open content

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:24,150
present for example HTML you edit HTML

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:27,570
and you share it and use it as HTML so

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:30,980
you can make share your work and people

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:33,720
can HTML document with no problem

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,760
it's the format preferred for consuming

00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,800
the open content different from the form

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,190
and prefer for revising or maxing the

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:46,620
open content for example flash and SWF

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:48,360
so if you share a flash I know you do

00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,180
not do this anymore because flash

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,270
doesn't doesn't have to be shared

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,730
anymore but if you do you share like the

00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:00,270
the format let the flash they do table

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:03,060
but when you will use the flash you use

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,880
the SWF so is that different format we

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,730
can do this like with videos if you

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,980
build a nice video and you shared as a n

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,590
before people will not be able to edit

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,330
those videos because they are closing

00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:18,750
those from it that you share

00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:21,180
so the ALMS analogy is basically those

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,700
questions that you have to do before you

00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,290
want to share our open educational

00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,080
resources so if I want to share

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:30,570
something I have to ask for me those

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:35,520
questions and see if my content will be

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:37,240
really really open I believe that we are

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,030
in a stairway so if

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,920
we are sharing we are better than we are

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,350
before that when we're not sharing any

00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,620
things like I shared something that I

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:50,170
build using PowerPoint okay if you add

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,080
the license if you add the Creative

00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:55,390
Commons license it's better than not

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,330
sharing at all so we are moving forward

00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:00,880
maybe we will we will reach those point

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,980
where every question here will be okay

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,309
and open educational resources will be

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:09,220
amazing that anyone can achieve those

00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:11,950
contents remix and anything like that so

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,480
we will reach there one day but think

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,700
about that when you want to share

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:21,010
something like a material think about

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:24,640
arms to check if this is really open and

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:27,309
what I'm doing at the Masters so what

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,100
the undergraduate students or future

00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:33,460
teachers in those case know about open

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,370
licenses and oh we are so in the first

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,800
half of this year I started my research

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:42,280
with those future teachers they are

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,320
biology teachers so they don't have like

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,480
much contact with technology during

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,670
their graduation they have contact with

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,520
technology during their daily basis like

00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,860
using their cell phones using a computer

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,470
access the internet and stuff like that

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:59,590
but they're not used like the technology

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,570
inside their graduation and we did some

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,940
activities during the semester to

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,240
collect some information about them

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:10,390
about how they what they know about open

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,370
licenses in oh we are so regarding the

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,550
characterizations of those participants

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:19,120
they are between 20 and 24 years in

00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:22,179
majority 17 students attending the first

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,280
degree only nine of the individuals do

00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:28,030
not have any kind of experience as

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,929
teachers so they are 21 students during

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,990
this research

00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:35,399
the participants technological profile

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,080
provided essential data for the

00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:39,720
understanding of the subjects

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,049
experiences with technology so 15

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,320
individuals used a computer one or more

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:50,250
times a day five used three or more

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,559
times a day in in the week and only one

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,590
use less than three times a week and the

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,630
option rarely was not selected by any of

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,240
the participants so they have a lot of

00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,820
they use a lot of technology during the

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,679
daily basis and complementing this

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:09,299
question 18 participants almost everyone

00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,610
stated that every time they use the

00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,679
computer they also use the Internet so

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:17,940
every time they connected using their

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,620
computer they also use the Internet in

00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,480
the relation to the verification of

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,700
license of content found on the web

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,990
which often indicate the restriction of

00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:30,419
users counted 12 participants reported

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,570
not having knowledge about the ways of

00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:35,130
consulting the license and for answer

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,799
that they did not carry out the

00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,659
consultation so they are not worried

00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:43,470
about the license they simply get the

00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:46,559
content use and they don't care about if

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,870
people share these in an open license is

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,380
this if this is thought right they don't

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:54,330
know how to check that only five stated

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,850
that always verify the license of the

00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,490
publishing material but later when we

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,440
are working during the workshop teaching

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:05,100
them how they can build material they

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,139
can remix material we saw that they

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,559
don't know how to verify the license

00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:15,299
they only think of Internet these three

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:19,679
okay I can use it so sorry for not

00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:22,350
translating the those graphs I tried but

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,559
they are already meshes so another

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:28,590
problem with open formats they are not

00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:31,669
saving lightning in a dateable way but

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:35,000
they are basically to say that almost

00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:38,460
every student say that we search for

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,399
free resources but not free as freedom

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,950
free as free of cost so they don't care

00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:46,649
about this is a open image

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:50,519
and use it in my job I can use this in

00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:52,980
my material I can publish and I have to

00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,080
say who is the author and stuff like

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,929
that they only seeks for something that

00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,510
is free doesn't have a watermark okay

00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:02,820
it's fine to use so they are not worried

00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:07,889
really worried about the openness of

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,870
something so they are use it to tell who

00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:13,230
the author is but because of the

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:15,960
graduation they receive this this the

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:18,090
professor's always ask them to do that

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,970
or you have to say who is the author of

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:24,600
this where you get those texts where you

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:27,570
read that so they are used to that but

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,289
in general they only use the content

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:34,139
without checking anything this other

00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:36,960
questions about if we they think that

00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:41,309
any content can be used in the Internet

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,950
so um the blue area is the the people

00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:47,639
who answer that yes anything can be used

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,200
if you see who is the author it does you

00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:51,000
don't have to check about the license

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,149
you don't have say oh I got this from

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,720
this guy or I got this from someone and

00:22:54,149 --> 00:23:00,299
okay you can use it so almost almost

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,940
half of the students only thing that you

00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:06,899
have only to say who is the author and

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:10,440
okay everything is fine from now on the

00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:13,740
green area is no because some of the

00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,990
resources are under restrictions so we

00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:21,179
have some students that are concerned

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:23,880
with that and in this other question is

00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:26,940
do you know what are the open licenses

00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:31,490
or Creative Commons for example the blue

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:34,230
area is no I never heard about so almost

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,840
more than a half of students never heard

00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,200
about Creative Commons we infer

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,029
sometimes that students have problem

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,889
basically with that it's not like they

00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:46,769
don't want to share they know how to

00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:49,139
share they don't have training in how to

00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:52,919
share they don't have stood yet how to

00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:56,520
share and the head area over there is

00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:59,250
that already heard about but

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,400
it doesn't know what is exactly so uh I

00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:06,020
heard somewhere that is Creative Commons

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:10,980
exists but I don't know what is this

00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:13,080
so we infer from from the data that we

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,840
collected that most participants are not

00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,380
aware of the rules and conditions that

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,630
are inherited to the OE are they

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,910
consider that because it's published on

00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:27,240
the Internet there are no rules so is

00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:29,090
the Internet is free for me to use this

00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,190
confirms the importance of promoting

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:34,620
specific training on the subject for

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,870
teachers so we developed with those

00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:40,350
students two different activities and

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,910
right now we are analyzing the data to

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:45,560
see the results and what can be improved

00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:48,660
in future interventions we did our

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,480
basically a class talking about open

00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:54,780
licenses and open educational resources

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,020
something similar that I did here so we

00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:01,380
show it then what are open licenses and

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,450
what is open educational resources what

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,470
are the benefits so we did something

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:10,470
like that with them and in the second

00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:14,880
activity we did a workshop in the in the

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:17,160
lab so they have presentation that is

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,140
under Creative Commons and they have to

00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,110
improve this presentation to build a

00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,330
better presentation and we try to work

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:26,040
in groups so one group build a

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,140
presentation and then this group

00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,240
presents the presentation to other group

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,780
and together they have to combine this

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,540
presentation and oh it goes on until we

00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,390
have only one presentation but what is

00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:42,060
fun is the first slide when they showed

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:46,860
me the final presentation is using an

00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:49,980
image with a watermark so I toggle and I

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,950
explain it now but we we go to Google

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:55,920
and we choose like only images that we

00:25:52,950 --> 00:26:00,240
can use yeah but you they don't know

00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:02,010
that if you choose like a similar image

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,500
in the Google when you search for an

00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,750
image they shows vitals images and can

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,710
choose I want something that I can use

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:13,559
in my work but in the similar image

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,929
they are not necessarily images that are

00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:19,380
under the same innocence so they choose

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:21,690
one of those similar images and they use

00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,970
it on the the work and we have to talk

00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:27,330
about that in the end of the semester

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:29,820
they have to present a full class using

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:32,429
an open educational resource so they

00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,950
build like entire class they have to

00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:39,149
talk with us show the material they

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:42,779
build so basically the most challenging

00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:45,779
for them was finding the license of the

00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:48,870
material or finding the right image they

00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:53,399
want to show us with the license we want

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:56,640
so for example one of the one of those

00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:59,640
groups presented a talking about animals

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,510
and they are they find hard to find

00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:06,120
images of Brazilian animals that are

00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:08,190
under Creative Commons license so they

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,919
search it in Wikipedia and other

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:14,190
websites but it's hard to find the exact

00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:18,450
image they want to show to the students

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:21,210
for example so in a nutshell the lack of

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,700
knowledge pointed out by participants in

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,860
the available listens formats and the

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,529
rules that they must respect when using

00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,020
an OE R demonstrates the importance of

00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:33,690
preparation for teachers and which stood

00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:36,179
ease and activities on we ours are

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,610
developed right now I am doing something

00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,590
similar to that I am trying to send as

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:43,350
much as as much as possible workshops

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,750
for CNT scientific events in Brazil

00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,570
trying to present open educational

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:51,059
resources and open licenses and trying

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,850
to encourage people to use more open

00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:56,880
software to use free software to try to

00:27:53,850 --> 00:28:00,090
change those the mind of those people

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,340
that always only use like closet

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:05,190
software's so what most of the events

00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:08,190
have like the template is a closet

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:11,039
format like I want to share our paper in

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:15,240
an event in Brazil I believe like more

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:18,059
than 90% of those events only use like a

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,460
dot docx format so they share it with

00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:22,799
you affirmative you can only do it in

00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,600
Word and for me it's hard because I only

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,539
use like open off

00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,519
I have always to check in another

00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:32,519
computer to see if I not broke the

00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:36,960
obtained plate to send my paper to this

00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:38,429
event so this preparation it's important

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,350
because this will be capable of

00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:43,470
encourage the publication of content

00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:45,929
freely and openly test ensuring freedom

00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:49,830
for use and remixing of the materials

00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:52,500
producing and openness is impacting many

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:56,190
areas of education teaching curriculum

00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:59,669
textbooks research policy and orders how

00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,740
will this individual impact synergize to

00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:05,580
transform education this is the question

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:08,100
I want to leave to you those are my

00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:11,759
contacts so I am on github and Twitter

00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,980
and this is my email if you want to ask

00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,450
about anything about open educational

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,399
resources or if you want to share

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:20,669
something cool about open educational

00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:23,190
resources or open licenses I'm free so

00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:27,149
please text me I will love to respond

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:31,169
and I believe we have some times for

00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:33,840
questions I want to say thanks for you

00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:37,919
listening to me I hope that you can

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:40,009
understand my English and thank you for

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:47,299
being here today

00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:47,299
questions we have a microphone over

00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:02,650
thank you very much for the talk you

00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,630
briefly mentioned fonts and I find that

00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,690
this is one of the biggest problems I

00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:10,930
have in trying to use other people's

00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:13,810
materials is that they start off perhaps

00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:16,240
using creative materials of Microsoft

00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:19,330
Windows and using the default fonts one

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,770
of which is Arial and then as you try

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:25,830
and bring them in the fonts of course

00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:29,020
the wrong size and everything doesn't

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:31,540
render properly so if you're going to

00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,770
create a document and particularly if

00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,150
you're going to create a template for

00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:38,980
the document please use an open font

00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:42,220
yeah this is the most important thing

00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:44,740
when I am doing the masters one of the

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,550
one of the classes the professor shared

00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,430
with us

00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:52,630
template and then it only shared a dot

00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:54,340
docx template and I build Oddity file

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,320
and send it to me and say please

00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,590
professor when you add this so people

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,600
can also use an open format and this is

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,240
started changing in the master so it

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,730
depends on us if we are like we are

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,390
doing like a small job every time we do

00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:13,120
this we try to invite people to use

00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:15,850
something open but it's important to do

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,820
it's a multiplying work if you do with

00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:20,440
someone maybe this person will do the

00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,290
same with another one and another one

00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,360
and maybe one day we'll have an open

00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:28,230
format for the templates and will not

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,230
have this problem

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,940
so this is all well and good but why

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,920
can't we just use an image that is on

00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,240
the Internet

00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:47,170
because maybe it's prettier than any of

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,390
the others why is this a problem in fact

00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,520
your let me see if I understand the

00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:55,600
question you are asking why is the

00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:57,880
problem for using the images a copyright

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,110
so it doesn't explicitly say you not

00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,030
allowed to use it it doesn't say

00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:04,030
anything yeah you know because there's a

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,530
lot of those out there and I don't want

00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,930
to use it to make money from because

00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,780
that would be bad and I will say where

00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:13,660
it comes from because I'm trained well

00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:15,520
why can't I use it yeah in fact if this

00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,500
is the first question students make but

00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,710
it's not licensee here

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:24,850
I believe it's open but in fact if we

00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:27,310
read the copyright terms every country

00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,230
has its own copyright terms they say

00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,900
that if you not share with the license

00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:35,350
it's closing so it's not a license

00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:39,010
anywhere it's closed it and and if you

00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:41,860
use it and later like the owner of this

00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:44,080
image try to bring you to justice

00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,270
probably you have some problem with that

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,250
so if you try to build an open

00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:50,650
educational resource for example you

00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:53,200
have to be sure that everything inside

00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:56,590
is open educational resources is under

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,680
Creative Commons or xander open license

00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:02,560
or you have problem in the future maybe

00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:05,920
the author can inquire you why you

00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:08,650
shared its job on the internet like if

00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,140
you maybe this open educational

00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:13,150
resources makes really really huge

00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:16,090
success on the Internet and then you

00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:17,980
became famous of your open educational

00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,260
resources and if you don't care about

00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,840
the images or the content maybe you have

00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,940
problems in the future in that way but

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,760
it's a good question with the outer our

00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,400
end sometimes it's hard because some

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,160
sites gets the images from the internet

00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:36,070
and they don't care about get the

00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,440
license that are on the on this website

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:41,380
as well so they can bring the

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,750
information all together like the image

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,150
and the license so sometimes it's not

00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:48,280
the fault that it's not outer fault

00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:51,640
it's the fault of the website bring

00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:54,490
those images together but it's something

00:33:51,640 --> 00:34:03,250
that students always ask if there's no

00:33:54,490 --> 00:34:09,700
license why I cannot use thank you very

00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:11,800
much thank you and this material is
