Have you already heard about Open Educational Resources (OER)? Do you know how an Open License works? In this talk, we will discuss those topics and learn more about why those things are so important for education. This talk is built for anyone who wants to get more involved with open education and wish to apply its concepts for any material under open licenses.

We will take a brief look at the history of the Open Educational Resources and the open licenses (specifically Creative Commons), we will discuss the results of a survey with future teachers about their previous knowledge about OER and Open licenses, and we will talk about how we can change this scenario.
