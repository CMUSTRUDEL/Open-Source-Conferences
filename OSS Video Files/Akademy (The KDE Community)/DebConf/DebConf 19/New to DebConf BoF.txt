A BoF especially targeted at DebConf first timers, from DebConf old timers. What to expect, how to communicate effectively, how to get the most from this experience.

This has been done at DebCon15 and DebConf16 before, was received well but unfortunately wasn't continued - and noticed to be lacking during last year's DebConf. So .. here we go again. :)

Room: Audit√≥rio
