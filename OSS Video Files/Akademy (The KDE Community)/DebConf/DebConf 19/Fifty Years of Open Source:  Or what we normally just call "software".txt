2019 is an interesting year.

It is the fiftieth anniversary of Unix, the Internet, Woodstock, the LGBTQ movement in the USA, and Linus' birthday.

1994 was the year that V1.0 of the Linux kernel was released, the Linux/Alpha project started, and Beowulf High Performance Computers were invented.

1999 (twenty years ago) the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) was started, and the Linux Professional Institute was formed.

Many of these projects had a fundamental change to computing, and this talk will discuss what some of those changes were and why they are important even today.

[Applause]

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:16,090
okay so this year is 2019 it's a very

00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:18,759
important year for lots of reasons we'll

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:24,009
see in a few moments but this talk is

00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:26,680
really about ex unix/linux and why it

00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:30,759
UNIX and Linux so important what did it

00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:33,820
really do first of all I have to remind

00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,180
you that UNIX is a trademark of the Open

00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:40,570
Group in several countries is used as a

00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,700
standard - a source code standard for

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,950
systems that if you program them in

00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,500
source code you should have your program

00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,270
work and of course Linux is a trademark

00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,000
of leanest Torvalds in several countries

00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,860
around the world now from time to time

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,829
in this talk you'll see a little

00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,600
asterisk beside a word that usually

00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,120
means that this is a much longer

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,199
discussion that would typically happen

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:09,130
over beers and the more a service there

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,460
are the more beers it takes now first of

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:16,420
all I am really old this year I will

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:19,840
actually be 69 years old I started

00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,329
programming in 1969 I first programmed

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,759
to a mainframe computers and then many

00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:28,420
computers after programming on UNIX

00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:32,439
since 1980 and I first became introduced

00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:35,229
to Linux in 1994 a first time it came to

00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,009
Latin America was in 1996 Caracas

00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,459
Venezuela

00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:42,490
that was pre Chevis I've worked for lots

00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,889
of companies large and small I've had

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:48,159
lots of jobs from programming to systems

00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:50,859
administration I taught computer

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,799
programming and and computer science is

00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:56,950
small - your Technical College but most

00:01:53,799 --> 00:02:00,939
of all I am a business person and I am

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:04,270
pragmatic which means that to me free

00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:07,709
software is not a religion it is simply

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:10,780
a good way of developing software

00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:13,989
I'll also warn you that I'm going to be

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,440
jamming 50 years of history into a 45

00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,390
minute talk

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,270
and my memory isn't what it used to be

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,310
and so maybe I'll remember something

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,890
wrong and you say no no it was it that

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,790
way you can you can use that for your

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,580
talk okay

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,730
or you can talk to me about it over

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,740
beers so let's talk about some of the

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,810
anniversaries that are going on this

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:41,240
year I am the chairman of the board for

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,700
the Lynx professional Institute we do

00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:48,230
certification of open source

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:52,160
professionals too so they can get jobs

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,230
good jobs we separate the certification

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,900
from training so you can gain your

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,090
knowledge any way you want to and then

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,800
you take a test to get a certificate

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,130
which says that you know what you know

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:09,440
that with recommendations and things

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:12,770
like that can help you get a good job 25

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,080
years ago was the version 1.0 of the

00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,270
Linux kernel now if you bring out

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,380
operating systems you know that version

00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:24,260
1.0 means that that's the time that it's

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,300
really useful to people before that

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,459
you're under development it's not quite

00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:32,030
there yet but when version 1.0 comes out

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,360
it's a signal to everybody that you

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:39,230
should be using this to do real work and

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:43,790
in 1994 version 1.0 of the Linux kernel

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,800
came out it was also 25 years ago that

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,720
Beowulf supercomputers were created

00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,959
we'll see a little bit more about them

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,480
later on but this was a major

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:57,110
application for new Linux at that time

00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:02,000
and most of the major distributions came

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:03,650
out either in 1993 or in 1994 some of

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,019
those distributions are no longer with

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,959
us distributions like soft landing

00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:10,610
systems and age yourself but some of

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,150
those distributions are still with us

00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:17,239
and Debian of course is one of those

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:21,410
Debian was formed in 1993 and had his

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:24,380
first major release in 1994 it's also

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:26,390
been 30 years of the world wide web Tim

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,780
berners-lee developed that at CERN and

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,430
it's been three

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,060
years that the worldwide web has been

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,010
here and helping people use the Internet

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,200
it's also been 30 years of the UNIX

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,130
license plate and there's lots of beer

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:45,150
stories about that and what that means

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:48,360
but going back even further to 1969 as

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:52,139
you know it was people walking on the

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:56,520
moon and the entire world came to a halt

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:59,940
in these days 50 years ago when we

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,460
allowed ourselves to imagine that we

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,850
could leave the planet and walk on the

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,380
moon Woodstock a big music festival in

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,860
the United States with a lot of the

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:14,310
bands that maybe maybe or fathers or

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:18,330
grandfather's know Jefferson Airplane in

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,640
the Eagles and the Grateful Dead came to

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,090
Woodstock to play Jimi Hendrix and

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,040
others in New York City at the Stonewall

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,620
Inn was the beginning of the LGBTQ

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,080
movement in the United States where

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,040
people were treated badly by the police

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:38,370
and rioted to have their rights and in

00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,400
New Jersey at Bell Laboratories two

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,080
people Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,710
started this little system called UNIX

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,350
and we'll see more about that later the

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,330
internet was started with a project from

00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,560
the government of the United States

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:58,080
called ARPANET we had a 15 bit address

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,900
space at that point because nobody ever

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,000
thought that billions of computers would

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,770
be hooked together by this thing called

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,169
Dean ARPANET and leda's Torvalds was

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,500
born yes leanness will be 50 years old

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:17,100
this year in December which makes me

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:21,210
feel incredibly old I wrote my first

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:26,100
program in 1969 when an IBM 1130

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,419
computer in Fortran with cards and I

00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,350
programmed the whole series of different

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:33,000
computers since then and finally 50

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,840
years ago was the last time I ever

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,729
shaved

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:41,500
now in the beginning computers are

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:44,569
physically huge and logically very small

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,000
memories are measured in kilobytes not

00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:50,599
megabytes or gigabytes gigabytes or

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,490
terabytes but kilobytes I programmed on

00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:55,729
the computer that had four thousand

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,409
twelve bit words and it had switches and

00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:01,400
lights on it because that's how you de

00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:03,620
bugged your programs the if there was an

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,400
operating system it was an extremely

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:09,830
simple one and then over time where

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,400
complex operating systems were created

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:16,039
to help people use these incredibly

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,639
expensive and by today's standards

00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:23,539
incredibly small and incredibly slow

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:26,840
machines now there was a lot of people

00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:28,550
who thought that different vendors

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,090
brought out different operating systems

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:35,000
to block their customers in to their

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:38,750
system to make their customers buy only

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,199
their system I was in those companies

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,599
I never remember that discussion what I

00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,599
remembered was engineers trying to

00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,819
figure out how to make their systems

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,020
more efficient how to help their

00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:55,699
customers solve the problems better

00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:00,080
because if you if you wanted to lock

00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:02,810
your customers into your system you only

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,080
needed one operating system on your

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,069
piece of hardware and as example the

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,460
pdp-11

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:13,490
hardware system from digital had 11

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,110
different operating systems on them some

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,240
were for badges somewhere for time

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,240
sharing some were for real time and yes

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,930
they even had a fledgling UNIX system on

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,759
there so why would you take the bother

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,919
of supporting all these different

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,349
operating systems to lock your customers

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,909
in when you could have done it with only

00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:36,890
one so this is an urban legend maybe the

00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:43,399
marketing people had those discussions

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:47,620
but the engineers never did now it is

00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,560
time of 1969 most software was just

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,020
in source code for you did not

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,120
distribute a binary distribution because

00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,990
it took a lot of effort to make that and

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,450
almost every computer that was out there

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:04,210
was a different architecture and maybe a

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,710
different operating system so it really

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,280
didn't make sense to go through the

00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:11,170
process of developing that in addition

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,080
there was no really such thing as a

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:16,000
professional programmer if you were

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,290
writing code it was because you were a

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,050
physicist or a chemist or an educator or

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,590
maybe some type of business person who

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,210
needed the software for their own use

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:31,120
you didn't write software for other

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,040
people maybe you worked for a computer

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,710
company and you wrote one of these

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,170
fledgling operating systems but that was

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:41,440
slightly different

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:45,430
there was also no software copyrights or

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,320
patents in that time frame if you wanted

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,450
to protect your property your

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,170
intellectual property you did that

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:55,690
through a contract and so if you wanted

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,780
to buy a compiler from some company that

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:04,950
made one and by the way that compiler

00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:07,810
might cost 100,000 US dollars in 1969

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,410
you would first call up the company and

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:14,070
you would negotiate with them a contract

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:17,020
your lawyers would talk to their lawyers

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:20,230
to figure out what your rights were in

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,880
the use of that software and eventually

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,610
you'd sign the contract you would pay

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,620
the money and an engineer from their

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,750
company would show up with the magnetic

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,020
tape to put that on your computer and

00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:35,670
get that piece of software working on

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,990
your computer that might take a week and

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,820
you might run it through a series of

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:44,080
tests to make sure the software was

00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:47,800
working properly and then you would keep

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:50,890
the source code in a safe in case that

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,040
company went out of business because you

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,510
had purchased the software and the

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,520
contract would tell you what you could

00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,740
do with that

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,940
soft often this would take months of

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:07,480
negotiating time there was also many

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,890
points of scaring of code after you

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,190
wrote your program if you were

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:15,100
physicists or chemists you say what am I

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:19,810
going to do with this am I going to sell

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,820
it selling software is hard work because

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,400
people expect bug fixes and

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,230
documentation and there wasn't a way

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,360
there was no internet back in those days

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,720
so you had to advertise your software

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:36,100
some way and that was expensive and so

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:38,230
these people joined user groups like

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,910
dicus the Digital Equipment Corporation

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:46,450
user society or share that was IBM's use

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:50,170
a society or brainstorm that was novels

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:53,260
user society or they contributed their

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:56,200
software to a bulletin board and from

00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:01,780
there people could copy this software

00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:04,690
for free and use it themselves and maybe

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,830
they would contribute bug fixes to it or

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,440
ideas to it

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:16,440
to make it better and this was the way

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:19,840
it was done in 1969 - around 1977 now in

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,110
1969 in New Jersey there were these two

00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:26,050
guys Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie who

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,760
wanted to work in operating systems ken

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,040
Thompson had been working on a large

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,410
project but was removed from that

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,130
project and brought back to Bell Labs a

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:38,110
research organization and they found a

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,270
cast-off pdp-7

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:44,230
computer in the hallway nobody was using

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,640
it it was turned off and they said could

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,010
we use this to work on our little

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,520
operating system

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:54,220
now the pdp-7 was so small and so

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:57,760
miserable as a computer system that it

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,860
didn't even have an assembler for it so

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,250
they had to do a cross assembly from

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:06,220
writing the UNIX kernel from one machine

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:09,400
punch it onto paper tape and load it

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,570
onto the PDP 7 and then debug it with

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,870
switches and

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:16,270
so in the front panel and they did this

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:21,160
and they said well we're going to break

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:23,080
this small kernel and we're going to put

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,930
just a small amount of functionality in

00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:29,140
there one reason was because the pdp-11

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:32,410
was so small they couldn't build a

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,240
gigantic kernel it was big enough to

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,940
hold one so they created a small kernel

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,000
and a lot of things are out in user

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,400
space this was different than a lot of

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,920
operating systems of the day when larger

00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,470
were expensive machines because they

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,270
would put all that functionality into

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:54,490
the kernel of the operating system

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:56,860
itself which made it unstable and so Ken

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,200
and Dennis thought no we're gonna make a

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,320
small kernel and we're gonna have a lot

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,940
of the other functionality in libraries

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,290
and things like that out in user space

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,500
now the first double couple of

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:15,220
conditions of unix were written in

00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,590
assembly language for the PDP sub but

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,490
eventually the PDP 7 was too small and

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:26,430
too slow so dint kena's Kenan Dennis got

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:30,490
a PDP 11 which was a little bit larger

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:34,050
64,000 bytes of address space has

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:38,020
separated out into instructions and data

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:40,660
system and user space so actually the

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:46,660
total amount of memory was for that four

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:48,360
times 64 K and once again they had to

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,640
rewrite the kernel completely

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,820
differently completely again because the

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,040
pdp-11 was a different architecture with

00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,640
a different instruction set and of

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,480
course a different assembly language and

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:06,430
so they rewrote the kernel again in

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,360
machine or assembly language and Dennis

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:13,000
said this is too hard I'm gonna write a

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,940
language that we can program in

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,030
something higher level than assembly

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:23,260
language and so he wrote the language C

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:26,230
and so they rewrote the kernel again

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,820
you see and if at all thank goodness

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,430
we're finished we never have to do this

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,530
again and then somebody said well we'd

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:37,060
like to have it on the inter data 8:32

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:40,060
oh we just have to recompile it no it

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,870
has a different architecture different

00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,510
devices

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:48,550
you can't just recompile it and say ah

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:52,300
well baby we can separate the kernel

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:56,170
into two parts the parts are standard

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:58,090
like scheduling processes and upper

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,550
level management of memory from the

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,340
parts that are dependent on the hardware

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:06,280
like the device drivers and the bus

00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,950
structure and if we do that then we have

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:13,180
to rewrite less of the kernel every time

00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:15,610
and as a took the kernel from computer

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,770
to computer the kernel and the operating

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:23,710
system became more and more portable as

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:27,130
it went along now in the beginning the

00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:29,290
telephone company AT&T Bell Labs didn't

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,780
pay any attention to what Ken was doing

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,690
and Ken loved to go out to universities

00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,910
and talk about operating systems and he

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,450
would take along a tape of his favorite

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,460
operating system UNIX and worked with

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,890
the students at the university so they

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,270
could see how the operating system

00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:48,940
worked and they could perhaps make

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,890
changes to it and there was no charge

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,640
for this because he just gave them the

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:58,300
code but eventually Bell Laboratories

00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:01,240
kind of woke up to this and said no this

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,490
is our intellectual property we're not

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,820
going to let you do this anymore we're

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:09,700
gonna license it to the universities for

00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:12,280
a very small amount of money now if

00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,560
you're a research university like

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:19,660
University of California Berkeley or

00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:22,960
Columbia or MIT or Carnegie Mellon you

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,780
got the the code for three hundred fifty

00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,930
dollars to use over every computer in

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,420
your campus but if you are not a

00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:35,290
research university you're a government

00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,550
agency or the military or a commercial

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,770
company

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:43,150
or a small two-year Technical College

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:50,770
the price was 160 thousand US dollars

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:52,780
per CPU for for Unix I know because I

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,930
tried to buy it for my little two-year

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,930
Technical College and you had to tell

00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:02,050
them what your serial number was now I

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,460
want to see a raise of hands how many of

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,540
you know the serial number of your

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:12,100
laptop computer that's what I thought

00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:13,960
you're slackers you know but you had to

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,030
know that if you wanted to get unix for

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,860
it and if your if your laptop computer

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,560
broke you want to transfer to another

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:24,310
laptop computer you had to call them up

00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,530
find the person inside of AT&T tell them

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:29,770
what the new serial number was and then

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:34,810
you could transfer that it was almost

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:37,890
impossible but because this UNIX thing

00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:40,690
was becoming more and more portable

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:43,660
there was a trade-off at this point in

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:47,050
time that computers are becoming fast

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:50,920
enough and cheap enough and the memories

00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:54,550
were big enough that that the movement

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:57,040
moved from trying to save the computer

00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:00,130
and can get the extra cycles out of it

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,680
to recognizing that retraining human

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,140
beings in different operating systems

00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:08,740
was more expensive than simply buying

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:12,040
another computer and so the beat the

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:15,070
focus was shifted from making the

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:18,430
operating system squeezing every cycle

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,470
out of the computer to making it so that

00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,750
you could do the same instructions the

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:26,140
same commands as you went across

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:30,250
different computer systems and this was

00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:32,920
very important now other types of

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:36,000
contributions of UNIX were things like

00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:39,370
taking the command interpreter and

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,060
moving it out of the kernel and making

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:46,240
it a user level process so the shell as

00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:49,780
we call it and it used to be shell

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,410
within C's show and then the K shell and

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,880
then four inch

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:58,090
well endowed the born-again show bash

00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:00,250
the shell was a separate process and the

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:03,220
shell allowed you to use these things

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,770
called pipes and filters which was a

00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,570
very unique concept the ability not to

00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,300
have to create a bunch of temporary

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:13,540
files to hold your information but still

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,360
to take the output of one command and

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,090
feed it directly into the input of the

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,390
next command and this was such a radical

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:25,750
concept that a man named Doug backer boy

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:28,780
who came up with it had to work to teach

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:32,680
ten Thompson and Dennis Ritchie what he

00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,180
was talking about but now most people

00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,250
when they use the command they think

00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,920
pipes and filters oh man that is the

00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,050
greatest thing in the world but it was

00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,320
Doug McIlroy who came up with that

00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:46,390
concept other things over the years that

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,990
UNIX and Linux came out with network

00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:51,940
file systems like NFS I still remember

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,250
the year of the network file systems

00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,130
where people talked about RFS and GFS

00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,860
and everything else and NFS seemed to

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,450
with all of its warts seemed to become

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:05,260
the thing that captured people's

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:08,140
imagination the X Window System as a

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,510
client-server relationship over the

00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,270
internet over networking also came out

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,430
and there were many more interesting

00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:22,540
concepts of computer science they were

00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:28,240
first introduced to UNIX systems now by

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:31,090
1982 the proprietary system era was

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:36,370
still in full force Digital Equipment

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:39,550
Corporation had VMs hewlett-packard had

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:42,700
their proprietary operating systems IBM

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:46,300
had MVS and others but there's this

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,670
little company in California at Stanford

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,880
that had this little single board

00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:55,180
computer that was very powerful and very

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,130
cheap and his company became known as

00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,280
Sun Microsystems and they wanted an

00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,230
operating system to go on that and first

00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,090
they went to Dec they said could we buy

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,120
VMs from you and Dec kind of fly

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,309
at them and they looked at CPM another

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,850
operating system but that was weak and

00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:14,860
miserable and so was ms-dos come to

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,940
think about it ms-dos is still weak and

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:20,559
miserable and but they went to the

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,940
University of California Berkeley they

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,559
saw this thing called Berkeley UNIX and

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,029
there was this guy named Bill joy who

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,250
had been on the Berkeley UNIX team and

00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:33,940
he came to Sun Microsystems and he

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:37,000
helped them port Berkeley UNIX to their

00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:42,970
little single board computer but it was

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:46,600
still $160,000 for a license for UNIX

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:49,090
and so they went to AT&T and said if we

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,549
only put this in binary form if we don't

00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:55,049
distribute the source code could we

00:22:51,549 --> 00:23:00,159
distribute it for a lot less money and

00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:02,860
AT&T said yes we charge you only $350 if

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,279
it's admired every form and so Sun

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:10,419
started selling these workstations with

00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:13,029
UNIX on them for $350 for the UNIX

00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:16,450
license now back in those days the

00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:18,909
workstation was still five or six or ten

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,909
thousand dollars so $350 for the

00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:25,539
software license was not a lot of money

00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:26,850
and for that you got a two years or

00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:30,970
license

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:33,490
that's strange why two users well you

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:36,730
have the the general user who's logged

00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:40,630
in doing their work but the second user

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:44,620
might be the root user or it might be

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:46,750
uucp logging in to transfer data or any

00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,340
number of other things a byte login in

00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,340
the background to do this and that's why

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:53,200
you needed two users but you also had an

00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,940
unlimited user license that you could

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,100
purchase for a little bit more money and

00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:02,110
people could log in over the ethernet

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:05,409
now other companies started to see this

00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:07,510
and say hey this is a great idea Digital

00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:09,490
had been supporting UNIX but only from a

00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,380
hardware standpoint they would fix the

00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,360
hardware if it was broken

00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,630
they did not distribute eunuchs

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,090
themselves they did not sell services

00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:21,549
for UNIX but they saw Sun Microsystems

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,679
doing this and they said yeah we'll

00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:26,770
bring out our own version of UNIX in

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,770
binary form to take advantage of this

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:32,530
licensing deal and so that's why a lot

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:36,220
of these UNIX vendors started putting

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,780
out unix in binary only form not

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,690
necessarily because they were trying to

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,370
protect their intellectual property

00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:47,830
boughs because they got a cheaper

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:50,530
license from AT&T at that time there

00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:53,080
were two different types of UNIX systems

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,539
there was one that you could get from

00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,090
Bell Laboratories decom telephone

00:24:55,539 --> 00:25:00,429
company called system v regionally was

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:04,600
system 3 then system for then system 5

00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:07,750
and but system 5 only had a swapping

00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,320
type of virtual memory subsystem so the

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,870
largest program you could possibly hold

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,710
was limited the amount of RAM that you

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:23,080
had main memory they gave you two

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:24,880
compilers one C and one Fortran 77 but

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,049
their networking was limited to

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,360
something called uucp UNIX to UNIX copy

00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:34,299
that basically would use a serial modem

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,409
to call up another system transfer your

00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:41,860
whole file transfer your mail and then

00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:45,039
shut it down and that system would then

00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,250
send it to another system this is called

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:51,159
store-and-forward

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:53,470
Berkeley UNIX however also known as BSD

00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:57,669
Berkeley software distribution had

00:25:53,470 --> 00:26:00,850
demand page virtual memory so your

00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:03,669
program was not limited to only the size

00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:07,120
of your physical memory anymore but was

00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:12,730
limited to the address size of your CPU

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:17,230
and so it is a 32-bit CPU it could be 4

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:21,630
billion bytes in size they also included

00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:24,520
three compilers C Fortran 77 and Pascal

00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,030
Pascal was used a lot by educational

00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,370
organ

00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:31,800
since and it was a nice little compiler

00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:34,660
but most importantly it had tcp/ip and

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,210
with that you could have not

00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:40,240
store-and-forward but you could have

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:43,000
packet switching to be able to transfer

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,640
data huge size it had Ethernet support a

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,090
lot of things that system five did not

00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:52,270
have and so most of the vendors went

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:55,450
with Berkeley UNIX instead of system

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:57,160
five now at Digital Equipment

00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,770
Corporation we had a big discussion

00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,090
about what we should do system five were

00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:07,120
Berkeley we almost went with system five

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:09,220
for one reason we realized that the

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,180
University of California Berkeley did

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:15,190
not have an advertising budget but AT&T

00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:19,060
would continue to try and push system

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:22,360
five for four or five years with

00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:26,530
advertising every week every place but

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:31,540
still Berkeley was the better system now

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:34,390
there was one person at MIT who didn't

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,720
like the concept of a binary only UNIX

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:39,430
system having been at MIT they were used

00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,500
to getting the source code for these

00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:44,140
UNIX systems because they were research

00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:47,380
university and they had a source than a

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:51,940
source code licensed for UNIX that was

00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:53,830
across the campus and he started getting

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,360
these binary systems from these

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,910
different vendors and he would ask for

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,190
the source code they said now you know

00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:02,740
yes you have the source code license for

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,870
from AT&T but you need to get our source

00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,730
current license also and that'll cost

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:09,340
you an additional thirty five thousand

00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:14,710
dollars now to put this in perspective

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:17,740
in 1973 my parents bought a

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:20,570
three-bedroom house when a quarter acre

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:23,990
of land all brick

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:28,670
with a kitchen a family room it'll you

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:31,040
know just a nice house for $32,000 so

00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:33,680
the source current license for Unix

00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:37,730
in those days was more that my parents

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,400
paid for their house and he said oh no

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,380
I'm not gonna stand this I'm gonna

00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,570
create this operating system that's

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,080
going to be a complete operating system

00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:57,140
available in source code and I'm going

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:59,420
to call it good new good new okay and of

00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:02,450
course that person was Richard Stallman

00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:06,460
and in 1985 he started the Free Software

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:09,260
Foundation to act as a funding and and

00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:12,560
logistical a place for developing this

00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:16,210
software system now the interesting part

00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:20,270
of this is he didn't start immediately

00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:23,270
writing a kernel because he had writing

00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:25,790
her kernel back in 1984 the kernel have

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:28,340
been obsolete by the time anything ran

00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,950
on top of it so instead he started

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:34,250
writing applications that people could

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:37,460
use on top of any operating system and

00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:39,530
the first application he wrote was Emacs

00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,150
and some people say he could have

00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:44,480
stopped with Emacs because it was a

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:46,340
complete operating system itself but he

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,290
continued on and they would compilers

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,870
Suites have been generated and utilities

00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:54,890
generated and the thing was you could

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:56,660
use this one VMS you can use this on MVS

00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,910
you can use this on all these other

00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:02,060
systems on top of UNIX systems and

00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:04,790
people said all the same commands and

00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:07,520
the same software and the same

00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:12,890
programming interfaces across all these

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:15,260
different systems and this that allowed

00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,300
the people to be more portable across

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:21,980
all these systems you might microphone

00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:25,820
is falling off from there we go now this

00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:28,430
code also allowed little companies to

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:31,100
started up they prepackaged to code and

00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,720
they were distributed on CD ROMs and

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,590
things like that it company is like

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,159
primetime software

00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:42,840
and bookstores are sold UNIX good new

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:45,840
software on these CDs and books before

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,960
this or rightly existed as a company and

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,590
they were books on how to program UNIX

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,309
systems how to use Emacs you know all

00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:59,460
these things but O'Reilly thought that

00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:02,400
UNIX was dying and so they actually

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:05,010
stopped producing new UNIX books and

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,070
they started producing books on how to

00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:11,309
program Windows NT

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:13,080
how to program Microsoft stuff and I

00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:15,659
don't blame Tim O'Reilly for that

00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,390
because he had a company that he was

00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:20,250
trying to keep going but eventually

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,770
other companies like Cygnus came out

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,890
I've only got 12 minutes left so I have

00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,659
to speed up a little bit but Digital

00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,850
Equipment Corporation was supporting

00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:32,820
UNIX they started to produce her own

00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:36,899
systems and that's why in 1983 I went

00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:39,330
there to join in their concept there was

00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:42,260
also a big battle between UNIX systems

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:45,720
labs which consisted of Sun and AT&T

00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:49,100
battling all the other UNIX vendors for

00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:53,130
to capture the UNIX market and

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:56,690
eventually they merged together but

00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:59,190
before they did they started a lawsuit

00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:02,309
against a little company called BSD I

00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:06,809
that was taking the BSD software that

00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:09,899
still needed an AT&T license and they

00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:12,450
were distributing it for $100 for the

00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:15,210
distribution and the source code and so

00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:20,850
UNIX systems labs started suing them and

00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:25,309
this suit went on until 1994 I remember

00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:29,340
that date it's very important because in

00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:31,679
1991 a university student in Helsinki

00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:35,460
Finland said I'm gonna write an

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:39,260
operating system kernel just for fun and

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:42,750
this kernel became of course Linux and

00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:46,860
they people used all of the BSD code and

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:48,450
code from a I'm sorry all the canoe code

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:51,659
and code from BSD

00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:55,379
and code from MIT to put together Linux

00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:57,779
distributions now why could this happen

00:32:55,379 --> 00:33:02,580
at this time what was so important about

00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:05,039
this because at this time the Intel 386

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,249
processor had been out for a number of

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,190
years and the three the 386 processor

00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:13,799
was the first processor from Intel that

00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:18,269
actually supported demand page virtual

00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:22,799
memory the 286 of 180 60 80 88 and all

00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:26,820
the rest were swapping systems and lead

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:29,609
us had a brand-new 386 computer with

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:32,100
this miserable crappy operating system

00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:35,009
on it from a company we will not mention

00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:37,019
their name and he knew that there was a

00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:40,529
better operating system than that and it

00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:44,960
was called Unix and so he decided to use

00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:48,539
his computer to write this do curdle and

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,249
a lot of other people had these systems

00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:52,499
that were being retired from their

00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:55,470
professional system to a hobbyist system

00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:57,539
a system at home and the internet was

00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,909
now moving to the home it wasn't just at

00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:02,340
universities or companies it was coming

00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:04,739
into the home made it a lot easier there

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,499
was a lot of information or blind about

00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:11,339
how to do great computers and the world

00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:13,589
wide web was maturing so in 1994 10

00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:18,169
years after the canoe project started

00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:23,700
people were able to create this little

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:26,250
UNIX system in 1994 I saw Linux for the

00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,760
first time I bet leanness and I said I'm

00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:32,909
gonna help you move Linux from a 32-bit

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,619
system to a 64-bit system and so I had

00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:40,829
got him a 30,000 US dollar alpha system

00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:42,780
to help do the port and I started to see

00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:45,149
the power of the free and open-source

00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:48,149
software community because people would

00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:52,290
buy these systems themselves and then go

00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:53,800
ahead and port to them and and work with

00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,070
the project

00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,710
and the good new Linux system exploded

00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:03,340
at that point and people started using

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:04,810
it for shell systems ISPs started to use

00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:07,240
it because there's a lot cheaper than

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:11,260
SPARC solaris and did everything that

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,780
SPARC Solaris did and in 1994 Beowulf

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,150
supercomputers came out because the

00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:19,210
supercomputer market was dying and yet

00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:23,350
we needed supercomputers to do various

00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:26,790
projects the most important project was

00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:29,530
actually something called fluid dynamics

00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:32,800
fluid dynamics is everything it's

00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:35,620
whether it's you know even this table

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,590
even though it looks solid it's actually

00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:41,050
doing fluid dynamics heat is fluid

00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:44,080
dynamics everything is fluid dynamics

00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:46,810
and so we needed high-power computer

00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,580
systems to do this and to people dr.

00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:52,440
Thomas Stirling and Donald Becker in

00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:54,940
1994 conceived of the idea of building

00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,960
supercomputers out of commodity systems

00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:01,810
and today the 500 fastest computers in

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,770
the world all run Linux there used to be

00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:11,560
two computers that ran Microsoft but

00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:12,970
they gave up so we've had many years

00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,180
where we promised the eunuchs that

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:18,580
Munich's desktop and that was because of

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,710
fur is have been hard because the first

00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,840
of his only Dossett windows and people

00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:26,650
would actually write down on pieces of

00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:29,550
paper type this in hit return key type

00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:33,220
this in but then what happened was

00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:35,950
browsers came out and browsers were

00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,200
different a scroll bar didn't always

00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,840
look the same a button box didn't always

00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:44,470
look the same so people stopped doing

00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:47,620
that and then we came along with

00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:51,040
something else we came along with iOS we

00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:52,540
came along with apples phones and they

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,910
were different still they were different

00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,490
than Microsoft and people started using

00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:59,650
them and say all I have to learn what

00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,510
the computer is actually doing not just

00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:06,490
how to hit this button or this button

00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:10,200
box and then Android foiled apples plan

00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:12,880
and so I believe that in the future

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,609
Apple will have the same combination as

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,430
they have with Microsoft seven percent

00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:20,380
of the systems will be Apple and they'll

00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:24,490
be very profitable and people really

00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:28,750
like them but the other 90 percent will

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:31,540
be Android because unless you you know

00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:35,170
you cannot make money with Apple unless

00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:38,050
you are Apple if you can say the word

00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:42,880
Android you can have Android on your

00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:46,390
hardware and that's why and now we have

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,490
the cloud and the cloud is doing the

00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:51,910
same thing the proprietary systems did

00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:55,119
before they hide all of the code from

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:56,740
you they're just as proprietary even

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,830
though they're using Linux underneath

00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:04,170
there just as proprietary as they used

00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:07,869
to be and we have to fight against this

00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:11,070
we have to protect people's privacy we

00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:14,680
have to help them understand the issues

00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:17,349
because if they don't then they're going

00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,560
to be exposed to the same proprietary

00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:23,380
stuff that we always have so as a

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,180
summary of this history UNIX created

00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:29,530
portable code but more importantly

00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:32,859
portable people and good new Linux real

00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:35,670
it that save them from Windows NT and

00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:38,440
the server system and on the desktop and

00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,930
created helped to create the free

00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,420
software culture which has been added to

00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:46,540
by Creative Commons and other types of

00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:49,599
free software licenses and when I told

00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:53,410
people at digital that what I was doing

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,380
they laughed at me my managers laughed

00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:59,770
at me and now all of those managers work

00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:04,140
for IBM because they all went to work

00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:09,400
for Red Hat and IBM bought Red Hat

00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:11,470
so the future we have a bunch of users

00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,080
out there and they really don't care

00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:17,110
about Debian they really don't care

00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,990
about free software we have to educate

00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:23,440
them we have to go out there and tell

00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:25,480
them why they should care about this and

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,350
we also have some companies who swear

00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:31,000
that they now love open-source and I

00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,680
will tell you that there's three types

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,260
of love in the ancient Greek there's a

00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,890
copy the love of mother for child the

00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,700
love of you know God for children God

00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,580
for humans

00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,440
there is feliz brotherly love the love

00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:50,470
that we have with our friends and

00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:53,620
colleagues and then there's eros the

00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:56,650
love that we you know the dirty down

00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,480
deep it's love and that's what some of

00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,940
these companies the love that they have

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,830
for free software and before you start

00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:07,960
dealing with them you put on your condom

00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:10,390
we are close to world domination more

00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,810
and more companies are now saying yes we

00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:16,960
should be using free software but we

00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:18,970
have to keep fighting for that what we

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,860
need we have to keep fighting for open

00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:25,540
hardware we have to keep fighting for

00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:28,690
our governments our universities to be

00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:31,030
using free software now I'm working on a

00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,140
series of different projects one of

00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:36,340
which we're going to be talking about

00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:39,130
here kaneda's Lucas another one is I'm

00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,590
the chairman emeritus of whit accompany

00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:43,750
the Kadena's Lucas project is very

00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,550
interesting it's a hardware platform

00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,760
that's being designed and manufactured

00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:51,190
here in Brazil and we hope to the rest

00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,070
of Latin America and was going to be

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:56,800
open so that any other country can use

00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:59,560
what we're doing to be able to make this

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,750
Hardware in their country

00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,840
it's not completely open at this point

00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:07,120
but we are working in that direction and

00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,990
we want to have a completely open system

00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:13,600
that is completely verifiable by any

00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:16,870
country to see if there are trap doors

00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:20,860
or trojan horses or malware in either

00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:23,230
the hardware or the software now when we

00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:26,170
announced that DEP cough was going to be

00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:29,290
here in 2019 I started going around the

00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:33,250
world trying to promote it but Curitiba

00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:36,220
is my second home I have a godson here

00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:39,820
his name is Cowen I have a brewpub here

00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:42,850
it's called ha Patrol and we are here to

00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:45,850
also promote caninus lucas which is

00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:49,540
portuguese for crazy canines there's

00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:51,610
going to be a ball today in room 109 P

00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,130
at 3 o'clock for the people that are
