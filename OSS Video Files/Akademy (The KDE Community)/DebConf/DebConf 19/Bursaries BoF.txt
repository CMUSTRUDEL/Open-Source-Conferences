	00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:13,010
so let's officially start because it's

00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:18,980
one minute posted okay

00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:21,450
welcome to the debconf pessaries bath

00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,460
where shall we start with the agenda I

00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,400
guess the topics that we pasted in there

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,950
or yeah we can do questions generic

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,340
discussions afterwards right I think we

00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:34,590
should I mean none of those things are

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,510
burning for me but why don't you go

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,820
through the subset of the agenda that

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,410
you want to and then go we'll go to

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,719
questions as early as it seems

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:48,510
reasonable cool okay so Samuel isn't

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,940
here but he posted a topic about this

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,339
discuss about the description of

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,359
essential part of travel bursary request

00:00:53,339 --> 00:01:00,170
at the berries page and what that comes

00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,059
down to is that for this year we have

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,700
travel expenses and food and

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,820
accommodation but literally nothing else

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,430
so if you need money for visa that

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,110
wasn't covered if you need snacks and

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,149
refreshments while traveling at the

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,310
airport that's not covered if you need a

00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:19,439
child Kay for your kid or dog that's at

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,380
home while you're coming to them that's

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,969
not covered if you get if you don't get

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,740
paid from your work while you're

00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:28,320
traveling that's not covered so

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,320
literally nothing else except travel

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,780
food and accommodation is covered in

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,789
bursaries and for some people that's

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,689
actually a real problem because I just

00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:41,700
can't afford the visa fees but on the

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,450
flip side is also slided to that because

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,670
if we had paid the visa fees which is

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,179
quite a substantial amount

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,009
there's about all those twenty nine is

00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:57,630
twenty nine to twenty seven twenty seven

00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:59,549
people from South America that we ended

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,740
up paying berries for we wouldn't have

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,390
been able to give them any bursaries so

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,920
there's definitely some trade-off

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,960
between buying some of those additional

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,880
things and giving more people the

00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,920
opportunity to be able to attend the

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,480
debconf and at some point we need to

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,410
decide where we want to draw that line

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,120
and

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,010
I'd be happy to get more feedback from

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,990
people and how they feel about that is

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,140
it is it worthwhile to ship that for

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,840
next year or should we keep it the same

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,310
and I think we have a few people in the

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,950
room so I think I'm also thinking maybe

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,390
we should do some kind of a survey in

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,190
the future where we get why the

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,660
community feedback and what I think is

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,600
more important is it more important to

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,820
give the you know people who really

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,920
can't afford it a bit more accessibility

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,640
to get into DEFCON four is it better to

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,170
give more people at least some level of

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,940
ability to make it out to Deb because

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,680
because everyone who got the best we

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,350
accepted it even despite not getting

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,350
that visa and I I realize that's going

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,330
to still be hard for them but yeah I'd

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:25,120
like to get some more feedback in this

00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:28,690
room Sledge do you ever mic for people

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,310
to go through the visa process to then

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,750
to the extent that I mean I'm sure we

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,820
all saw there were quite a number of

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,500
people coming literally like two weeks

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,690
before the conference saying I've just

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,800
got my visa one bucking ticket oh crap

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,520
the tickets have got a lot more

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,610
expensive I know it's a regular call

00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:49,810
while it's something I appreciate in

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:52,450
this is normal in this room so it's we

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,970
we should be pushing even earlier and

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:58,420
earlier in terms of getting the bursary

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:01,420
stuff in and make a point of saying be

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,209
more open people but for both upfront I

00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,040
guess to say if you need a visa to

00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:10,360
travel to Deb conf you will need to be

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,090
applying now yeah and you know it's the

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,370
the very day that we say you have a you

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,609
have a bursary you must be applying for

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,350
the visa

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:22,660
of course because while it might be

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,790
harsh to people to say you know if you

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,770
leave things too late we're not going to

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,169
pay for you if we warn people good and

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,849
early it then becomes their problem not

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,050
ours

00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:34,660
you know and then of course the flip

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,370
side is also for those folks actually

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,160
make sure that we actually have a

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,430
process in place so we can pay for their

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,949
flights two or three months earlier so

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,990
people then don't have the pressure when

00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:49,690
they're coming with no money of oh god

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,060
I've just spent $3,000 on travel I can't

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,500
that's my money for the year yeah yeah

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,090
there was a few cases where people said

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,860
I'm applying for my visa now and I was

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,060
what you should have done that a month

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:04,389
ago ready but we equally first stuff

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,060
like visas people should be applying

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,680
before they apply for the bursary if it

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,419
comes to if it comes to the front you

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,490
mean okay visas cost money too I

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:15,340
understand has what most freezes or not

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,349
that expensive for in some cases that

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,659
were very expensive this year and they

00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:22,120
required things like invitation letters

00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:24,699
as well which also cost money this year

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,620
yeah and that seemed really really

00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,020
strange but of course equally if we'd

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,880
been able to do that earlier we could

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,250
have we could have sent it more probably

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,550
much more cheap too much more you know

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:39,039
in a better way I agree in a general

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,050
sense that should be a rule although

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,909
this year the rules for India changed of

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,639
the bursaries were approved which

00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:47,469
completely messed us up but yeah yeah I

00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,169
was about to say that visa procedures

00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:53,500
should be more taken into account when

00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:58,240
accepting a bit but if the rules change

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,680
in our feet Daniel did you want to say

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,469
something yeah I wanted to say that you

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,569
can't move too early because in quite a

00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:08,560
number of jurisdictions you cannot apply

00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:11,139
for the visa too far ahead of the actual

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,060
travel date because you basically have

00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:17,500
something like a three months but that's

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,969
been true for every visa I applied for

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,680
so I usually apply three months before

00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:23,520
the type and that's why I said like

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,729
we're not that bad timing wise honestly

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,650
obviously this period in between people

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:31,780
have asked for bursaries and then the

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,479
evaluation and the reporting back that

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,150
should be as short as possible so you

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,529
know if we can make sure that people are

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,599
more on standby and there's more

00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:42,159
resource available we can cut kind of a

00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,270
months out of that and that is a very

00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:45,360
valuable month

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,330
but asking people to apply too early

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,330
does not work for visa in most places

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,800
and it has the risk of people through

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,690
you know changes in their private life

00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,190
and stuff like that and have more of an

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,639
issue of actually then coming to that

00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:03,370
corner so like that don't move it too

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,740
early oh wait we're not moving it to any

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,870
we just want people to pledge basically

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,940
said like you know we can go out earlier

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,370
and need to start even earlier and this

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,990
right I mean they need like a man said

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,870
lots of people started a month ago

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,580
that's way too late yeah that's like

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,650
another two months add to this but then

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,740
don't make it any earlier because then

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,840
people can't get so I'm pretty sure that

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,780
this year the evaluation process was the

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,789
fastest yeah we were they die often

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:34,810
schedules which is quite quite nice I

00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,849
was about to say the same thing the

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,490
schedule this year was earlier than

00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:41,680
previous years do we want it earlier I

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,900
don't think it will help because I mean

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,740
this day is at maximum three typical

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,990
three months visa

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,210
how long do we spend on evaluations this

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:53,949
year was it two weeks it was short it

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:55,870
was it was like two weeks I think so we

00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,840
can't do it first because that's about

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,460
the time it took to to properly do I

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,169
mean maybe it will be fast in the future

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,630
but this year we we really needed those

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:06,370
two weeks so if we were to try and do

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,139
things earlier it would mean we'd need a

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,960
budget earlier that was the block last

00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,699
year and the earlier you go the less

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,990
committed sponsors you get the more risk

00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:18,669
Debian is taking on yeah so let them you

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,590
take that risk we have money to spend

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:25,240
and again we've had this discussion year

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,710
on year on year actually in just about

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,050
every year I've been involved in this

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:33,370
process we've ended up being given more

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:35,560
budget later on in good causes

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,260
I've you know I think it will be totally

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:42,010
worth while agreeing with the DPL but

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,899
particularly for travel budget we just

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,000
i'll prepare to spend more of debian

00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,680
money and assume the money will come if

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,839
it doesn't come from sponsorship it will

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,730
come from central debian funds we have

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,130
the money

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,540
so those later top ups surely we should

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,010
be getting that money upfront rather

00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,200
than having to ask for two months

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:05,290
I'm coming to that a bit later and so

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:08,410
this is a general topic for that as

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,880
anybody who is not an Insider want to

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:17,410
say something it's been pretty insider

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:19,960
so hollow is also an insider right yeah

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,180
we learned a lot of things this year but

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,910
the problem is next year it's northern

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,130
countries other country you or I will

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:30,250
receive it that comes so everything will

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:33,460
change again for instance we have we

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:36,430
learned we failed to send the invitation

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,680
letters to our fellows from India we

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,140
spend a lot of time discussing this and

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,950
you you should you should have sent

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:48,340
letters earlier to them it was our fuel

00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:52,450
fill and but I would like to bake a

00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:55,120
little more and to discuss about is it's

00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,870
decided that we know givehim Bushman's

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,150
for food visa in the other things

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,910
because if we are in the same page that

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:07,030
okay we need to to to beat the things

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:11,020
early earlier but I think we need to

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:14,170
discuss about what what besides the the

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,450
tickity the tips with people can request

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:20,010
for bursaries team I think it's

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,010
important discuss this too

00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:31,430
well I mean we can just spend all of

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:34,529
Debian's money but we it's really hard

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,610
to do the bursaries process in general

00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:40,139
but it actually doesn't make it easier

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,269
to grow the budget well if we can just

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,790
say yes to everyone right but I think

00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:47,189
that is not an outcome that the project

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,490
wants also in general we like the

00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:52,139
debconf is kind of neutral or slightly

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,569
profitable and not lose a lot of money

00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:57,029
for Debian every year and Daniel okay

00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:59,459
Daniel then tumbleweed I think on the

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:01,350
finance side we are actually pretty good

00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:04,139
because what high voltage did this year

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,689
I think was very clever he looked at the

00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,639
ranking he said like you know when we

00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:11,069
could use another I think it was twenty

00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:14,879
five thousand or something like that to

00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:17,160
get another set of good contributors

00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,800
which we would want to have on-site in

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,720
and obviously DPL approved that is

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:26,310
what's left ended out there the over of

00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,589
money is not not the issue but we do get

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,259
applications of people that just would

00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:34,589
you know like to have a free holiday and

00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,579
it is important to have a cut-off if if

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:39,089
we don't know you

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,800
there's no no clear message on why you

00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:42,569
would want to be there and why that

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,250
helps you and why that helps a project

00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:46,259
this is absolutely fine to not get a

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,660
bursary and I think we have a very good

00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,779
level with the process that you

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:54,899
established I think we have a very good

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:58,410
level of as far as humans can do this

00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,110
judge the people and and make sure

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,850
people that need to come and should come

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,009
and would wanna come actually have that

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,370
opportunity and not paid by debian in

00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:10,019
that round so I hear this meme of people

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,059
applying for a bursary to get a free

00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,209
vacation but I've never actually seen it

00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:18,630
while being in the process so I don't

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:20,370
know if we should like optimize to avoid

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:24,209
that case which doesn't show up in

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:26,850
practice I haven't seen in the last two

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:29,430
or three years but going back a few

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,959
years there was one guy who applied

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,420
every year who have nothing to do with

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,810
Debian in any way nothing to do with

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,279
free software

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:40,090
was just looking for treat free travel

00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:42,250
out of an African country I'm not gonna

00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:45,580
name any names obviously but you know it

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:48,730
does happen something that it was not

00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:51,790
clear to me and this year it's for

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:55,690
distancing I I'm in question 1,000

00:12:51,790 --> 00:13:00,339
something $1,000 $1,000 and the ice

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:04,540
painted 700 with flight tickets so I

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:07,589
thought that I had 300 can cause pain

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:12,400
with money with in the other other

00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:15,279
expenses because I thought that it until

00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:18,220
last year was like this and we talked

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:22,120
about that it's no if we if we spend 700

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:25,540
we that's enough we don't have 300 300

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:29,140
students paying is it okay I understand

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:35,350
it wrong that does bring us the topic

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:37,390
too because I this is actually topic 2

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,640
you might agree with me in a minute or

00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,200
two because I've we on this topic we've

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:46,900
had lots of discussions with the SPI

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:49,660
about this and they say oh I can't do

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,980
the thing where you get a budget and it

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,560
covers for more than that and any

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,450
climate back I'll have to write it up

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,890
from the email summary from the email

00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,260
because the problem is that turns it

00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,820
into a grant rather than a bursary and

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,480
if you make it a grant these tax

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:14,980
implications to that and it gets very

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:16,660
hairy very quickly you can say the money

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,160
spent on food but you kind of need to

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:27,190
get you need to plan that more in

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:29,260
advance and you know because in our

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,750
first version of the page was not clear

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,700
that the person it was only four tickets

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:37,209
flight we have to change the page

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:40,240
because I probably like me some people

00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,610
thought III mini quest for our expenses

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,060
that I will travel when I when I

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:49,470
traveling so we need to be more clear

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:52,240
clear about this

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,310
because on the webpage is not clear on

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,810
down there that conf website is not

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,790
clear laughs I think so on the website

00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,410
it uses the word travel expenses and we

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,330
probably need to define that term yeah

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,270
yeah yeah because if you say travel

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:08,680
expenses for us is not like take these

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:11,890
flights I think we have a question at

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,930
the back for a lot of people that

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,250
includes you know you might need a three

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,950
hour travel on a train to the airport

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:21,910
something that kind of thing or a hotel

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,620
and layover or visas or anything else

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,960
some people even wanted to claim travel

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:34,870
to go collect a visa and things like

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:38,160
that another country we have to travel

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,160
to other countries to get visas before

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,590
yeah so I agree with the point like

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,510
while I was filling the bursaries that

00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,850
travel expenses was very confusing for

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,470
me as a term because I thought it

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,880
includes resides include because I need

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,100
to take a flight to go to another city

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,140
to get the visa then also I need to

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,180
travel domestically the cabs and also if

00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,860
we can define it somehow that we only

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,990
mean these things by the travel expenses

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,420
it might be very easy for others to and

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,160
also regarding the visa if we can like

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,140
just ask him for the total bursary

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,730
amount we can ask for the break up kind

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,680
of thing like this is for the flight so

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,810
this is for the visa and we already have

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,520
a column that I cannot attend the DEF

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,960
CON video I'm getting the bursary we can

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,790
have it for Aggies also that I cannot

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,410
totally attend without getting the visa

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,570
fees or I might be able to attain

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,940
something so that might also help that's

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,260
actually exactly what discussed we

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,660
discussed last night Bremner actually

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,130
mentioned the same thing he said you

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,740
know we have a needs field but if you

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,080
had one specific visa maybe we can at

00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,710
least buy some visas for the people who

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,710
need it the most

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,380
I don't think it's good to make a

00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,230
decision right now I think we know I'd

00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,990
look somewhat yeah let's discuss it and

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:12,390
see whether I think this group is

00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:17,250
too small to even be a proper cabal's

00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:20,260
it's so definitely make clarifying

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,059
totally of what we consider reasonable

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,370
for travel expenses whatever that

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:29,470
decision is in the end it clearly sounds

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:30,790
like a good plan we should also try and

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,490
of course I'm pushing this onto a team

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,230
I'm not part of so it's easy but try and

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,250
get the local team for any upcoming

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,960
Kampf

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:44,890
to get really good links for visas and

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:47,710
try and get information upfront as to

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,240
what countries might be involved in - if

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,400
we can give guidance to people to say

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,140
you can apply for your visa for months

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,050
in advance we suggest you do it the

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:59,170
first day you can just to make life easy

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:01,210
for everybody so that is part of the bid

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,190
process of course one of the things we

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,420
require is information on visas and

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,100
usually availing to the Wikipedia page

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,840
which has pretty good data on this what

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,059
we don't have is the first state you can

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,220
apply and that's we should probably base

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:16,630
be basing bursary dates around that I

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,940
think if we have bursary results ready

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,860
at least three months maybe a few days

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,030
before that I think that's fine and I

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:27,610
think we will find this year with that

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:30,520
as well and then put information on to

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:32,770
say that if we told you you have a

00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,340
bursary and you can apply for visa now

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:38,140
do it and if it comes to crunching you

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,480
have not bought your flights until two

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,280
weeks before Devcon we are not going to

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,940
bail you out because you because you

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,640
screwed up

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:51,790
unless there's really good reasons maybe

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,740
I'm being harsh a bit well well as

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,660
several people mentioned I think the key

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,850
thing is to be clear in the beginning

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,790
about what expectations are and what the

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:04,620
rules are and then people will at least

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,620
know to make the effort

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,990
unfortunately due to day job I know a

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,840
lot about visa regulations and how to

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,880
attain them because there's like it is

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,470
really complex in some countries you

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,840
have both visa from the government and

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,070
the visa agency with us either mandated

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,500
like in China for example or not

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,510
mandated like in other countries which

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,220
you need to pay sometimes you need to

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,140
show up for an interview sometimes you

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,900
need to collect or disperse your

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,090
passport in person so the problem is we

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,250
need to write up what is okay and what

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,170
is not okay because in many countries

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,930
there are options to get I think Sledge

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,730
say that the visa rather cheap and there

00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,440
are very convenient ways to get the visa

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:55,280
and that maybe two thousand dollars and

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,250
so I'm you know I I'm offering to help

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:04,160
doing the write-up on on what is covered

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:06,620
in a visa bursary component because I

00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,270
kind of know for the most kind of

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,970
commonly restrictions like China India

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,370
and so on what what the troubles are and

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:24,200
what reasonable cost is and what maybe

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:27,410
not so reasonable copies out of dates I

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,570
can give an example as Brazilian if you

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,030
if we I want to go to the United States

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,990
I have to prove what I'm going to do law

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,660
there

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,540
I can't say I would like to have a visa

00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,790
because maybe I Megerian bursary to

00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,970
travel to the United States I have to

00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:47,390
have all documentation or where it's

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:50,300
going to stay and if the hesitation for

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:52,640
flights and everything yeah I can say

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,260
maybe gettable say I don't know yet they

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,700
would not give you the for us to us

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,020
there are some countries where you need

00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,490
the flights beforehand there's some

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,410
countries where they say don't buy your

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:10,850
flights anybody person yeah it depends

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:12,740
on the country yeah yeah yeah oh I've

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,520
lost my connection too so maybe gobby

00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,520
has a problem

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:29,590
so similar to what Paulo actually

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,110
mentioned and it is the same with India

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,540
as well so I'm a student and for me

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:38,380
requesting a visa was a huge thing

00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,420
because in the embassy departments and

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,760
stuff they they start asking so many

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,470
questions about are you working how much

00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,390
are you getting paid what are you doing

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,220
it's like I'm a student but then how are

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,600
you going outside for Brazil for like 14

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,180
days what are you going to do are you

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,770
are you there for immigration are you

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,600
going to stay there and all of those

00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:59,860
other things so we have to make sure

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,960
that it was an easy process I mean easy

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,670
process for me because because of help

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,770
from Daniel from Paulo and all of those

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,750
guys who send me the invitation which I

00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,130
actually showed them that see I'm

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,680
getting paid for the bursaries and

00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,060
everything and this is what you if you

00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,080
want you can clarify and talk with them

00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,780
and I

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,910
I got really sup without any hassles and

00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,560
stuff so if I don't if I didn't have

00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,170
that documents then I probably wouldn't

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,760
apply for the visa at all because even

00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,230
though I I could have applied for three

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,700
months ago if I didn't have the

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,370
documentation to prove that I am getting

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,400
the bursary I will not I mean it will be

00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:36,090
rejected

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,560
yeah but copy by the way sorry for that

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,870
from Brazilians fall for that

00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,050
sorry for that

00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,050
[Music]

00:22:50,010 --> 00:23:00,120
one sick so I think we're more or less

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,100
have consensus on on visas I mean maybe

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,780
not all the details but that we want to

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,790
make some changes and we want to consult

00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,559
further so I think we're at least

00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,900
halfway through our buffs okay so maybe

00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:13,290
we should sort of table that discussion

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,630
for now and I think everybody who wanted

00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:19,950
to say something did

00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:21,270
so next yeah let's move along so these

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,000
two things I just want to wrap up on

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:27,240
visas is firstly we need to decide on

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,010
Barry what was the actual topic yeah on

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,770
visas I think we need to decide

00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,690
collectively at one point do we where do

00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:38,190
we want that slider to be do we want to

00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:40,500
pay pay for visas and how and to what

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,460
extent because obviously it will shrink

00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,100
our budget a little bit

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,380
the second thing is we need to be clear

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,570
on whatever the actual policy is so that

00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,860
when people apply they know exactly what

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,740
they're applying for and what they will

00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,750
get out of it which caudill brings me to

00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,730
documentation as well but this

00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,260
documentation idea wasn't so much for

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:02,040
the user-facing stuff it was for the

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:04,350
best rigid 'men because this year was

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,360
the first year I did this history and

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,220
one admin side I did the rankings before

00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,730
I mean a great job by then they as it

00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:14,190
meant thanks but what I found is that

00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,030
the documentation how to do things are a

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,520
bit lacking

00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,679
there wasn't much information on exactly

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,020
way to do things and wait to find things

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,320
and now and again I discover a whole

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,320
view

00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:32,580
Nicola did it before so it's actually

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:34,110
kind of useful there wasn't the

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,919
documentation that exists now is what I

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:39,600
did so now and again I discover oh

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,780
there's a whole git repository full of

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,520
scripts that that exists that luckily

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,679
Brendan knew how to use because I

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,850
couldn't figure it out and mainly

00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:53,130
because I wrote them so the idea is that

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,740
we actually document everything in the

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:58,140
bursary process from start to finish our

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,270
teaser scripts are to set things up in

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,490
welfare because also once it's

00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,480
documented it's easier to suggest

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,180
improvements

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,300
and send merch requests on what you want

00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:13,100
to have changes in the process or add

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:16,230
suggestions and so if you want to help

00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,570
we can do a whole fake pastry run using

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:22,200
wafer taste which is a development

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:25,970
instance of the debconf website and we

00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:29,520
can do everything as if it was a real a

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:31,350
real a real bursary cycle and then you

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,610
can out document it and if anyone's

00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:36,990
interested in that please add your name

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:38,700
and and sometime after debconf will look

00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,620
into it I can't I win but maybe in a

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,330
month or two when when everyone's

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:47,250
recovered and back into the normal cycle

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:54,330
of things any questions before we move

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:56,370
on yes I think it's important it's

00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,410
important if you continue be the

00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,920
coordinate of the bursary I think it's

00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:07,110
very very good for everybody that you

00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:09,480
stay in this position please don't give

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:11,010
up I really wanted to do it just for

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,390
this year and finish the documentation

00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,190
and just be done but because the

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,810
documentation isn't done I think I will

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:20,070
actually do it for just one more here

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:21,570
and then and then someone else can take

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,240
it over from there and I can taste the

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:29,100
documentation and see if it actually

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:36,780
contains everything that's needed you

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:46,920
really need some continuity in the try

00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:49,700
to bring someone like having

00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,700
documentation is

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,110
I think crying get someone else to lead

00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:10,650
it and you take a back seat that would

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:13,200
be nice yeah so big I stumble way

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,390
volunteering too many hats yeah I agree

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,080
I wouldn't agree with that movies

00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,080
wanting TV

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:29,370
so can we move to the diversity budget

00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:32,960
okay so um I guess the the there's a

00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:36,870
sort of rubric for ranking people on

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,910
contribution which i think is some

00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,910
variation on something I proposed a

00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,950
couple years ago and is by no means in

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,380
the Debian Constitution so certainly if

00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,950
as part of this documentation process

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,780
when you look at that you could change

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,460
it

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,830
there isn't anything similar for the

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,790
diversity and there's probably good

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:02,820
reasons for that it's I think easier for

00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:08,640
us not easy but easier for us to agree

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:11,430
on how to rank contribution but I have

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,730
to honestly say that we didn't do as

00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:18,420
good a job of ranking diversity

00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:20,400
applications as we did for contributions

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,310
at least that's my subjective impression

00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,840
from from being on the inside seeing the

00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:28,730
application seeing the rankings that

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:32,100
came out I felt that things were more

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,540
random then possibly desirable I

00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,630
actually think a little bit of

00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:41,150
randomness is good because it gives

00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:44,900
people a chance but I don't know so I'm

00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:47,700
open to ideas how to to improve the

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:58,620
diversity ranking process that was a

00:28:47,700 --> 00:29:00,150
concern of mine as well plus one ranking

00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,950
I would like to have more guidance

00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,900
instead of having to come up with a

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:08,330
system for my own which is probably

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:13,130
different I feel like I'm probably the

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:15,190
second worst person to make up such a

00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:20,550
ranking system

00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:26,170
so I would really like it if somebody

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:29,560
like Ronda or somebody who is thought

00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:31,990
about these issues a lot would help us

00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,240
that doesn't mean you have to volunteer

00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:38,530
to be part of the bursaries team but

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,140
help us think about how to evaluate how

00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:43,450
we should spend our diversity budget and

00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,430
who we should ask to help us with this

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,710
and and and indeed if you want to get

00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:51,910
out of doing this you can always point

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:54,340
the finger at somebody else who is

00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,930
suitable this year was also strange

00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,610
because we had ten thousand dollars

00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:00,640
specifically for the diversity

00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:03,640
applicants but because the top-ranking

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,760
diversity people were quite expensive we

00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,140
could only we could only give bursaries

00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,040
to three people from that in the end

00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:15,160
because they came from so far away but

00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:18,970
that sounds depressing but actually we

00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:21,430
ended up funding a lot of people who

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,650
were newcomers to Deb Kong just because

00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,660
they were close and they didn't need too

00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:30,190
much money to get here so as far as

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:32,020
that's one aspect of outreach is

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,760
bringing new people to Deb comms and I

00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,930
think we succeeded at that I think we

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,850
should always be doing that that's one

00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,930
of the reasons one of our excuses at

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,930
least for travelling around the world

00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:45,040
sometimes I wonder if we should add a

00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:50,140
slight priority to people who have like

00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:52,570
like we we specifically let on say that

00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,700
everyone needs to hundred be RLS unless

00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,680
they will give them travel sponsorship

00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,360
because it will lots of them and maybe

00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,220
that should be a normal thing or maybe

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,440
even as a special line item selling that

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:12,790
you know locals who don't need much will

00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:14,410
will approve so I know we spoke about it

00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,270
a bit over the mails but would it make

00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:18,280
sense to put Debian outreach efforts

00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,960
into a diversity out of the diversity

00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,790
budget because you have lot of outreach

00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,310
applicants and g-shock which do fits

00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,170
into diversity criterias and Nicola will

00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,300
be able to answer that I think that has

00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,990
been done in the past I'm not sure but I

00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,820
thought most

00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,920
think a previous year that was done

00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:35,140
before and I think so in the past Google

00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,030
had a lot of free money for sending

00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,940
people to that count and they were very

00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,640
nice to us so when we asked for budget

00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,670
to bring I think seven google Summer of

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,059
Code interns in Cape Town they just said

00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:53,890
yes gave us like ten or twelve thousand

00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:57,400
dollars to do that they've been like

00:31:53,890 --> 00:32:01,240
cutting down a lot on these budgets but

00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:03,220
we've not asked even the program

00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,860
organizers if they would do something

00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:09,730
for the bill

00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:13,500
so yeah it has been kind of a blur for

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:17,740
the last two years to three years with

00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,080
money from these programs okay so we

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:22,780
might need to reach them a bit and ask

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,790
them you know do you have anybody we

00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:27,400
just need a separate line item for them

00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,850
and make sure that they are taken into

00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,760
account

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:33,400
yeah right and so one thing that's a bit

00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,120
tricky is that from an organizational

00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:40,240
point of view we put chuseok interns and

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:44,260
outreach interns sort of in the same box

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,780
but actually outreach interns already

00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,550
have a budget line well maybe that

00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,080
budget line should be bigger that's it

00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:55,679
that's a question that we could

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:59,620
certainly discuss but I can't imagine

00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:02,470
outreaching interns having difficulty

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,240
being funded in or other than that we

00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,240
just didn't have very much money right I

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,410
mean there's no problem with them as

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,320
diversity applicants I think that fits

00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:14,400
in with even the most simple-minded like

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,110
me idea of diversity yeah

00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,800
but the chuseok I think it's a special

00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:23,650
case and it's as I agree would think

00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:27,429
about that it makes sense to I think so

00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:33,429
my idea from many years back is that the

00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:35,290
more the project can say in advance yes

00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,720
we want to spend money on this the

00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,190
easier it is for the bursaries that

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,530
actually brings me up to the next line

00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:46,340
the fifth item my business it stimulated

00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:49,720
Thanks so yeah I basically want to kick

00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:53,000
some people out of berries this year

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,710
video team did a good thing which I

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,880
can't remember if I actually did suggest

00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,620
it earlier or if someone just

00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,840
spontaneously came up with it but I said

00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,910
we're going to ask for a separate line

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,130
item in a dead budget before just

00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,720
video team members and so that I don't

00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,220
have to go through the bursary process

00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,310
because it's kind of silly that we have

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,840
all these people have to go funnel

00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,200
through the berries process who are like

00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,730
local team members need to get here or

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,590
local team from the next-step company to

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,419
get here and I think that should just be

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,970
taken out of bursaries and move over to

00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:24,830
the online items especially like local

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,659
team from next year that can be assigned

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:29,480
to their debconf budget we don't even

00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:31,610
need to have that and that's a way to

00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,870
actually kind of artificially increase

00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:37,310
the overall DEF CON budget because I was

00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,750
thinking that you know the budget has

00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,550
been kind of staying the same and we've

00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,810
been asking for more money and maybe it

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,780
should be increased for inflation

00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:47,030
purposes but if we can take some things

00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,710
out of the bursary budget we can keep

00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,710
the bursary budget may be more or less

00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:53,330
the same and effectively have more

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,919
budget available and then the accounting

00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,929
looks more accurate because we can see

00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:58,310
this isn't actually like a bursary it's

00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,070
more like they've come first off that's

00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:03,200
that's needed to be at this type convent

00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:04,760
especially budgeted for so yeah video

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,700
team's been doing this for a few years I

00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:13,640
think we had a team member there's a

00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,260
problem there so we created a new

00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:19,130
process and we've been trying to do that

00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:23,180
more and more yeah I think other teams

00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,590
should be doing that too basically we've

00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:29,060
been saying that we should be doing that

00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:30,920
for years but if we can do it more

00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,530
University universally that could even

00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,860
bring enough to pay for visas if we do

00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:40,460
that so of course the problem is if you

00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:42,590
start doing the put in what we think a

00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:48,230
local team and say next year's local

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:51,080
team in you know bypassing bursaries who

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,060
gets to rank or wait or decide what's a

00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,340
reasonable level and I'm not saying that

00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:57,950
the people are going to abuse it I'm not

00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,140
at all but at least the bursaries team

00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:02,030
is a I guess a reasonably sensible

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,130
central location for doing that

00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,840
discussion maybe I will assume that

00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,220
people want will want to abused it

00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,320
whether that's actually the case or not

00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:13,550
just to be safe and because at some

00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:15,320
point things will go wrong so they might

00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,450
have to be some limits on it like saying

00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,690
for next year's local team its maximum

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:23,180
of three people that can split so we do

00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,310
have a budget process right and I think

00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,440
that that's where this these decisions

00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:31,490
can be made and the team gets a budget

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,470
and they can spend it as they see before

00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,360
a local team might want to nominate this

00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,920
tree people maybe they can justify five

00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,210
people needing to come over maybe it's

00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,920
neighboring countries will be so cheap

00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,270
that they can chain ten people so

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,700
that'll be in the budget process of the

00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:45,020
actual Devcon foot before that in it and

00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:51,760
certainly if they can find a way to get

00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:51,760
out of the budget of the problem here

00:36:53,380 --> 00:37:00,200
it's like squeezing I thought it did go

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,210
better this year though it's always

00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,280
painful though because I don't think

00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,550
there's a way around that the local team

00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,080
is trying to get things moving and the

00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:11,440
other teams haven't really started

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,210
thinking too much about them yet yeah I

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,190
mean lost last year the budget was

00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,770
finalized a month of the I think

00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:22,610
bursaries was going to be posted okay

00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:26,300
like I like the idea with essential

00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:28,490
people in the CCC we have something

00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,490
called forced active which means like

00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:33,530
you don't have to prove anything you are

00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:36,350
post active you're seen as active

00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:38,150
because your past contributions kind of

00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:40,070
warn that you will be doing the same

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,470
next year as you did all the previous

00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:45,280
years so I I'm very much in support of

00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:48,290
that and it saves load of the team I

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:52,040
don't like the idea to use next year's

00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:53,630
budget at all the reason is there is no

00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,390
approved budget for the next step coin

00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:57,920
so there's no way we can spend out of

00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,660
that because it does not have the PL

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,050
approval we won't get money out of SPI

00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,840
and it is just a trick in in budgeting

00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:07,440
that we shouldn't

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,710
right so let's be honest it is it is a

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,050
line item bring the next team there I

00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,940
think we for example from the DEF CON

00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,730
Committee know very well who the key

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,470
people are in next year's team so you

00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,780
know we can easily come up with a list

00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:24,150
of people we invite and if they can make

00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,180
it because of their jobs and family and

00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,960
whatnot they should come and if they

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,240
can't make it

00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,620
they can either nominate a substitute or

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,020
we just live with the fact that not

00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:37,560
everybody can come and learn here I

00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:41,310
think before that sound good but by the

00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:44,370
way we have expressed a very very nice

00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:49,920
for us that me and Adriana which two

00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:52,740
brothers to talk waved ape in the video

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,280
Jimmy springe it was very good for us

00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,680
because we could talk face to face with

00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,650
most of the the people that worked that

00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,680
is organized that becomes in global team

00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:09,150
so I'm not sure if this kind of request

00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,800
for him Bushman can be added today that

00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:14,190
comfortable study at all

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,160
oh oh oh if this is something different

00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:20,550
because if for instance II I I could I

00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:24,900
could go request boss it was both

00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:26,700
members much as video team which I I was

00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,040
included at video team and they could

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:32,370
get him Bozeman but a Triana Coolidge

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,550
he had he had to pay for all all money

00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:37,980
so it ended was very nice for us because

00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:41,180
we are not in Europe we are not seeing

00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,980
you from global Jimmy every move every

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:46,230
sometimes sometimes in the year so I

00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,890
think it is very it's very nice idea if

00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:52,680
you people found a local team we can go

00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:55,830
meet you find you in some months before

00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:59,160
that conference someplace in Europe some

00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:01,470
sprint around the group and I'm not but

00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,800
I'm not sure if this both days this

00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:08,130
amount of he Bozeman KB add/edit in the

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,410
ball team or if it's something different

00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:12,420
I think that yes there's nothing

00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,850
bursaries team because that's that's for

00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,470
Deb confessor is right but that can

00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,609
either be a line item in the DEF CON of

00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,650
budget which one

00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:22,049
to be approved by DPL or some other

00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:24,779
special approval by the DPL but I don't

00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:26,339
even think the Sprint especially the

00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:28,890
video sprint is actually the best place

00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:31,109
to go to because the there being the DEF

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:33,779
CON video team is so busy at the sprint

00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:35,819
that it's not really the best place in

00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:38,670
my opinion to simulate information and

00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:40,890
yeah but it happens that in the video

00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:44,009
team is pretty basically was people that

00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:46,319
we needed to talk like the global team

00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:49,170
like not not it was there from front

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:52,559
desk EU are there from as bursary team

00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:54,989
and from flag yet it was not divinity me

00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,150
but it was then there was people there

00:40:54,989 --> 00:41:01,079
that we wanted to talk we needed to talk

00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:03,299
so I think maybe the bursa team can give

00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,890
some help if we people from the next

00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:09,390
local team you want to do something like

00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:10,980
that so in is there anybody who has

00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,049
right that's just what I'm saying

00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:17,130
is there anybody who hasn't spoken yet

00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:18,749
who wants to say something or ask a

00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,170
question because we're getting to the

00:41:18,749 --> 00:41:25,140
end of the buff and I don't want anybody

00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:31,140
to go away and feel like they were cut

00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:37,279
out of the discussion anybody on IRC do

00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:41,989
we have IRC doesn't look like it okay so

00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:41,989
then I guess we'll let Daniel talk more

00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:47,549
first wanted to answer your request I

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,739
think the idea what you did and use the

00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:51,180
opportunity to go somewhere to learn is

00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:53,099
absolutely correct and we should

00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,670
encourage the local team to do that

00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:58,650
budget-wise that is just the normal

00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,359
reimbursement process so as you need to

00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,819
be a project member to do this anyways

00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:05,609
you file for reimbursement for the

00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:08,489
specific case with SBI you need a DPL

00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:10,739
approval you copy that then to SBI

00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:13,950
indicate reimburse this works for both

00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:16,319
you and Adriana and it is completely

00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:19,289
unrelated to to any depth budget Wars

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,369
yet just to to her she said that

00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:24,329
unfertile

00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:27,450
DPL digital proof rodron so he had to

00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:29,640
pay I get from the video Jimmy I was as

00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:31,200
a video t remember but I do under

00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,619
Coolidge so

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,270
but that that's obviously our dpl's

00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:38,460
discretion right he sees the person or

00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:41,280
she's sometime in the future it's the

00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,920
person that decides whether that is

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,240
justified in their view or not and it

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,010
wouldn't change it if we hide it in a

00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,800
different budget line the decision

00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:52,140
should be the same so to some degree

00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,089
that was abusing a process trying to use

00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,470
a video springe to have a def con to get

00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:57,869
together now it makes sense to meet up

00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:59,430
when people are together that works we

00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:01,140
should have set aside some time at that

00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,910
video sprint to talk Deb cons which we

00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:07,680
didn't we could have done this better if

00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:09,300
we planned for it a bit better you could

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,849
also get this budget through the debconf

00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,040
budget if the if you allocated part of

00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:16,109
the DEP comp budget to get local team to

00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,339
events in the year but then that can

00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:20,250
only happen after that budget has been

00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:21,990
approved and again if that involves

00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,250
conversation with the DPL so the DPL

00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:32,670
doesn't want this to happen the DPL

00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:33,930
doesn't think that on this is

00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:35,730
anything else one more question once

00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,500
that's last word something on the

00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:39,540
diversity would it be possible to have

00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,310
some statistics be public like people

00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,810
from which countries are coming genders

00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:44,400
and something like that it's very

00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,109
inspiring to see such kind of things in

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,930
public

00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:50,369
yeah the URL slightly secret go to

00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:55,230
registration slash statistics on the

00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:57,000
website register slash statistics I

00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:58,770
think that page is not public anymore

00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,859
it's not public public you just have to

00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:03,089
log in anyone okay maybe you can put it

00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:04,500
in the next year's birth city when

00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:07,530
people apply they can see the diversity

00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:10,410
statistics while applying that might

00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:12,150
motivate them more so if we hear the

00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:13,770
Deaf confused to publish a report that

00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,410
included this kind of information that

00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:18,630
hasn't happened in the last couple of

00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:21,710
years there's some vague half reports on

00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,710
the wiki that's about it

00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:45,080
it's at the bottom of the page there's

00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:47,990
so much something Ember now that we have

00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:56,030
a debate about include or not include

00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:58,460
the age 35 age I want to remove

00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,750
completely but I can become involved to

00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,660
lighting approaches for that because

00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:04,790
most a lot of us are over 35 already so

00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,940
giving points for that is bizarre it's

00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:09,170
weird so I actually made a comment for

00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,820
the people who ranked when I sent the

00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:14,000
email for ranking I said if people are

00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,590
very young like if they're 17 18 years

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,050
old rather give them a point for that if

00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:20,930
they're very old like I don't want to

00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:22,310
define very old if you're if you're as

00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,670
all this brain there you can also get an

00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:29,900
extra point but but yeah some sometimes

00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:41,700
it comes down to discretion yeah I think

00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:46,370
that's thank you

00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,370
