Discussion of Debian Cloud Team:
 * Status of official Debian accounts and images
 * User/permission management
 * automation of creation, testing, publishing images
 * improvements to created images
 * should we try to take care of containers and similar technologies?

We invite all people interested of using Debian in various clouds to share their experience, needs, and wishes for Debian in clouds.

	00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:13,520
so again welcome to our cloud cloud buff

00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:17,330
we had presentation present think our

00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,550
team on yesterday Anza Sunday today we

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:23,300
want to discuss more about our team our

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,220
what we plan to do what we did so few

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,960
most important topic our Sprint's so

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,900
what we managed to do after Sprint's

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,829
what the plank of new sprints most

00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,289
probably at MIT we should discuss our

00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:39,739
constitutes what's the status what is

00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:43,850
missing what we need to do or whether we

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:46,550
are waiting for somebody else what's the

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:51,980
status of AI especially OpenStack with

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:53,960
this and Summer of Code what's what are

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,210
we planning after it finishes how we

00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:02,050
plan to integrate this into our our

00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:05,089
infrastructure into our workflows and

00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:09,439
also we I guess we need to talk about

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:11,990
our team interactions how we work what

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,490
we should change what we want to change

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,179
and after after presentation we got some

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,649
contacts and

00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:21,429
it looks like people are expecting that

00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:27,350
we will be providing some docker and

00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:30,679
background images yeah okay so we will

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:34,340
we might if time is if there is enough

00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:36,979
time we should we should discuss this

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,009
but I guess in more context of our

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:49,719
ordinary workflow of providing more

00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:53,840
images so we start with sprint so we had

00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:58,099
we had quite nice print in Seattle last

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,929
year we managed to achieve something

00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:04,179
after the sprint especially account

00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:07,279
delegation accounts offshore accounts

00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:13,750
but other than that's not much

00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:18,130
unfortunately unless I'm missing some CI

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:23,569
so we're Bastion is working

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:25,069
so that that's good but I guess not much

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:29,319
of testing if I know

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:29,319
correctly at least I haven't touched it

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:53,480
so the spin today is two years ago I've

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:55,280
set up a CI thing inside Khurana and my

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,130
understanding is that we could not use

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:34,190
it because of some unique ownership

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:36,620
problems so right now I do have an

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:42,019
internal cloud that my company which has

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,610
an external API which is public would

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,760
you prefer to use that rather than

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,890
something in casual by itself yeah

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,049
what's your feeling Leon this story

00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:57,200
don't have strong opinions at all about

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:58,970
this it's beyond it is good to have CI

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,299
as quickly as possible

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:06,260
plugged in however we do that I don't

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:08,030
really care but so it said that doing it

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,780
with Debian infrastructure is good if we

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,890
can as a very first thing is I'm already

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,919
tightly monitoring that internal cloud

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:22,220
because for my company it cannot fail

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:24,500
when the case you know one if it breaks

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,690
maybe I won't know about it and when I

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,400
know about it maybe I don't have time to

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:33,310
do it you know what I mean so

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,350
if I have to choose between something I

00:04:33,310 --> 00:05:02,290
must put efforts on and something that

00:04:35,350 --> 00:05:06,699
I'm already working on okay so to

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:09,669
summarize so what does anybody know full

00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:15,690
state of what we have what we don't have

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:15,690
what are active processes or not really

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,919
yeah so basically it looks like busting

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:26,139
is the biggest but that the person with

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,650
the most knowledge and the most and so

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:47,169
we should get some other people possibly

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:49,450
to get what we're doing and it totally

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:54,310
fell off my radar was many many other

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:55,750
things came up of course one of the

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,729
points of having those regular

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,229
get-togethers was to help drive this and

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,139
make sure that you know we were tracking

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:14,110
what everybody was doing we've done a

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:17,560
fairly crap job of this images would be

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:22,110
published through a CI because that may

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:24,400
work for the big three closed source

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,530
providers this won't work for OpenStack

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,060
why won't you work for him Stein I'm

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,240
sorry that I don't believe you at all

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,760
because people need to register with an

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,250
account and give their credential to the

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,280
class to their OpenStack cloud so that

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,990
we can publish to these clouds oh sure

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,400
and we could we can drive that off the

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,320
back end of it's not a problem really

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,330
really really yes get

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,550
you've asserted this before there is

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:52,180
genuinely we can build anything from

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,220
sales a publisher however we want plenty

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,660
of ways to push take a process together

00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:01,030
here it does we in a safe way where

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,420
providers credentials are safe okay

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:07,600
other way around can't we use image

00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,270
finder which is supposed to publish RSS

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,280
feeds with newly built images and then

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,720
then they can pull it when they are at

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,330
the end this way

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,710
we don't that works too we don't even

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,180
need to store their credentials they

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,680
will just pull from from our

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:29,140
infrastructure is the C is also

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:34,270
connecting to them how does work on

00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:39,480
catalana where will the image finder be

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,480
hosted its yet to be determined

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,449
[Music]

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:54,700
[Music]

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:58,350
Debian net domain for now and trying to

00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:01,300
integrate as Ilana or something that so

00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:04,300
we have access to the dev infrastructure

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,570
anyway it's still very much working

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:12,790
working progress off have you seen our

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:17,650
toes demo it's oh of course

00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:19,240
it's you know as a as a new project it I

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,790
think it looks really good obviously

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,520
it's it's not finished there's a lot

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,560
there's still plenty of work to do so if

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,650
we with as a first cut will go through

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,680
the normal process we'll get us some AVM

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,870
somewhere and we'll point say cloud font

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,080
it cloud image or image finder or

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,180
something Debian not net at it once

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,099
we're sure that it it looks good and

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,229
looks reasonable we can then talk to DSA

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:52,150
and we can get that hosted on an on an

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:54,610
official Debian box okay cool that

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,440
sounds great obviously once once we once

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,939
we're happy and we know it works and

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,709
it's reliable we can turn it into

00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:07,199
official w.org service and yet we can

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,199
then you we can then plug into that yeah

00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:20,889
this is working on whisper pets I can

00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:29,459
work on making a puppet thing to deploy

00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:35,649
he's my trainer the point

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:38,559
let's find and do you think that the RSS

00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:41,289
feed is enough for your use case it's

00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:45,669
not because we are effectively uploading

00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:47,529
to a zoo or Amazon and Google that's a

00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,929
commercial advantage that I don't want

00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,759
them to have if we do that for them I

00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:54,039
want that we also approved for OpenStack

00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:59,679
flask I don't want that that providers

00:09:54,039 --> 00:10:04,449
have to do or pull from RSS feeds or

00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:07,809
something we need at least some kind of

00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:09,849
web signals and web hooks somewhere to

00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:13,299
tell the providers that they must

00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:18,549
download a best would be if we upload it

00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:21,039
directly instead of just sending a

00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:25,899
signal the single thing can be the first

00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:37,779
approach so what would we upload to

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:41,529
we've had this discussion before and and

00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:44,589
we stuff together we also need a kind of

00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:47,649
manual moderation thing because we don't

00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:50,829
want to be spammed with lots of

00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:55,509
credentials of whatever like the API

00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:58,389
could be spent for it or something do we

00:10:55,509 --> 00:11:01,979
already have contact to providers that

00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:04,420
use OpenStack in the cloud environment

00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:08,649
one yes

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:12,190
I want it for myself are there others

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:14,740
that we know of that that are in the

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,410
cloud team are at contact to the cloud

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,440
team so that's another thing I wanted to

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,510
do is getting in touch with OpenStack

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,260
providers if they want to join the cloud

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:30,220
screens so OVH for example it's maybe

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:32,769
one of the largest Rackspace city cloud

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,699
may be interested so I'll go through my

00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:39,420
list of contacts thanks I can see you

00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:43,779
have the best contact to the OpenStack

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,699
providers I have some contacts but

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:50,230
basically you have the best from our

00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:52,060
team so so we maybe need to discuss it

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,209
later whether we want to spread those

00:11:52,060 --> 00:12:04,959
contacts and so if if any cloud provider

00:11:55,209 --> 00:12:09,220
is watching the video okay so to

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:13,269
summarize it a bit we need to work on

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:16,390
publishing and we need two more people

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:20,290
to know what is the status of this CI

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:27,010
workflow SAS and we will probably need

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:30,339
to rework this and have to som have it

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:33,070
hosted or at least have ability to host

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:35,949
it on catalana and some external

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:38,079
infrastructure like info maniac or

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:42,040
something else so so we can switch

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:44,620
between them and we can and more people

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:51,430
know about what's happening and not only

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:59,260
promising but more remarks so this is

00:12:51,430 --> 00:13:03,310
process the current status I saw that

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:07,899
people are asking are there cloud images

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:10,000
for Buster even if there and then I read

00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:14,470
something that there's a testing

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,769
directory so should we advertise this

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:21,850
more these are not yet finally

00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:26,679
official images but there's just a link

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:28,569
or an URL where you can use this and I'm

00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:30,819
not sure what the current status is I

00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:33,999
just saw people are asking where do I

00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:36,429
get the images and I think that the the

00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:38,920
image finder will take some time but it

00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:42,639
would be nice to to have the information

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,949
where to point the people who could defy

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,869
image be published at the same time as

00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:51,670
the OpenStack one that's the reason why

00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:53,290
I couldn't test it of course I could

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,209
build it myself and test it but that's

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,559
not where I wanted to test what I wanted

00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:01,629
to test whether the final product that

00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:03,040
we publish its we're still missing a

00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:05,319
couple of pieces being hooked together

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,290
to actually make sure that we do publish

00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:12,639
the images that Bastian has coming out

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:14,199
of the salsa built so we can just put

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,499
those on pettersen and link to them or

00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:20,679
whatever in just the same way so can

00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:23,019
somebody where do you missing little

00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,839
bits of scripting in the couple of weeks

00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,329
before the buster released Bastian was

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,179
doing lots and lots and lots of work and

00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:34,209
on lots of projects and this didn't

00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:36,369
quite happen we just need to find the

00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:38,230
time to literally there's probably about

00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:47,949
a day's worth of that effort to make it

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:49,540
happen at least Mike and so I may be

00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:57,610
jumping the gun here but I know it's and

00:14:49,540 --> 00:15:00,369
that Buster images but can anything be

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,040
done in the meantime to say publish

00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:06,249
Buster images on the old accounts which

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,899
may not be ideal but work so that people

00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:09,220
can get on with stuff I don't think I

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:10,360
think I don't think people outside

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:16,569
they've been care what I can their

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:18,160
published from yeah sure so there's two

00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:21,399
bits of publishing

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,989
I think Noah as if I understand

00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,299
correctly Noah was already thinking

00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:28,419
about doing exactly that and just

00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:30,110
publishing some at least holding Buster

00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:33,279
images

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:36,440
through the old the old set up on AWS

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,240
it's painful or round the fact that we

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:43,100
haven't got the new account set up which

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,230
we did start this process months ago of

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,079
course the problem is if we do any

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:50,570
buster images through James Bond burgers

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,790
old account then people are still gonna

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,440
carry on looking there forever no it was

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,079
one of the things we wanted to do was to

00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:00,079
kill that off basically to have first

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,839
start with Buster to have to have Buster

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,850
only on new accounts and then people

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,200
people who use old images will stick

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,180
with all that counts people who want to

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,910
move will just move to new publisher

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,160
yeah that was the hope but we also

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,140
should be pushing stuff out on pettersen

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,700
I was due I did a little bit of work

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:21,649
with Bastian before the release and then

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,140
events over stalkers we just had so much

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,959
other stuff going on so for those who

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,100
don't know pettersen and cassia lana are

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,320
two Debian machines cassia Lana is our

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,440
stupidly big build box which has all the

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,620
cores all the memory all the i/o and

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:44,230
Pettersen is our publishing box which is

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:47,720
a front end to a huge amount of

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:51,649
bandwidth nicely helpfully provided by

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,480
the university / mayor in Sweden we just

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:56,029
need to to plug things together to make

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,149
sure that we actually have our images

00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:01,190
published so people can grab them as

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:02,899
both from the Debian servers and from

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,140
the cloud providers that's what we want

00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,140
to do

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,650
okay but I assume that all other

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:21,320
accounts on I'm sure and on micros and

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:24,760
on Google are ready and we publish

00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:31,250
images there as far as I can tell yes

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:34,580
have you looked I haven't no yeah okay

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:37,010
sorry guys we suck we were there's a lot

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,440
of work to be done here and we've not

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,610
done a good job of coordinating did we

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,530
mention that we could use more

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:47,750
volunteers in yes so you mentioned about

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:52,970
Sprint briefly is that coming up or is

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:55,670
that further up it's okay so we were

00:17:52,970 --> 00:18:00,170
discussing after Sprint's the status of

00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:02,810
building publishing and so so planning

00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,790
let's move it probably later because I

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:07,870
guess you want to move to the planning

00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:10,160
of newsprint well it's worth mentioning

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:28,880
unless we have anything else higher

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:31,040
priority first so we have had a well

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,740
sprint for the last three years running

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:38,420
hosted by each of the major cloud

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:42,380
providers in Seattle we were we've been

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:47,060
already been contacted by a in fact by a

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,980
Debian guy I think Jonathan at MIT who

00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,220
has already provisionally booked a space

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,050
so 14th to 16th of October I just looked

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:58,580
it up at MIT

00:18:54,050 --> 00:19:02,150
obviously in Boston which is an awesome

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:05,630
offer and already it seems that the that

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,760
the cloud platform folks all seem happy

00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,190
with that as well it's yet another trip

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,750
for the US for people on the team it

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,050
would be nice to not have all of these

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:19,730
in the US but equally it is genuinely

00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:22,960
very very important for me to have all

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,620
of the the best known cloud you know

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,000
representatives from all of the best

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,730
known cloud platforms

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:35,450
turning up as well there's a lot of

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:38,180
overlap here maybe you should try to get

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,740
people from digitalocean to come yeah

00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,590
yeah sure

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:46,190
well exactly so last year we were hoping

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:47,990
to even have last year sprint digital

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,830
oceans offices in New York we'd had an

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:54,590
offer but then there was a staffing

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:57,200
change the guy who had been offering to

00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,420
host moved on and apparently didn't pass

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,160
on the information so it was too late to

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,850
plan we definitely want to get

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,410
digitalocean involved you mentioned OVH

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:09,760
who I'm hoping could we could get to New

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:14,690
York as well maybe they have offices in

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,430
near Quebec so exactly so it's just a

00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:22,790
date it's really easy to get to Boston

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:24,770
from from Quebec Chile and it will be

00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:29,510
good to get lots more people involved so

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:31,760
in a chain to the community guy so he do

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:36,830
first okay cool can you put him and ask

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:41,380
him to join in sure but so to summarize

00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:45,020
this part dates are what's happening

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:48,080
dates are final so we can try booking

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,910
flights hotels and so on they have the

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,710
rooms booked at MIT we should make a

00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:55,730
decision as a team that we want to do

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:59,690
that to do this I think it sound but it

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:02,180
sounds very useful very good so I

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:05,390
suggest that somebody and I'm looking at

00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:07,010
somebody now possibly mail the list and

00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,230
say this is what this is what we're

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:12,020
planning and get the DPL approval for

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:17,660
travel that kind of thing okay so I will

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:20,750
send even still here to list if I don't

00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:24,520
get any disagreement till let's say end

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,520
of the week or something yeah that works

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:33,740
okay so it's good should we discuss

00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:36,860
strategy hotel because previously we

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,840
hope to have some shared reservations

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,830
but it didn't work out healthier and

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,570
deaf

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:44,150
we should actually organize this kind of

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,940
thing to actually have at least some

00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:52,130
overlap and try and coordinate better we

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:56,030
will publish last year maybe this local

00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:58,970
Debian guy could organize this alright

00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,890
at least point us yeah well and of

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,870
course the TPL is in Boston as well you

00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,179
know there's plenty of Gabbi in people

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,940
around I'm sure we know we might prevail

00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:11,860
on to get some help so I will even sit

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,860
with some and asking for tips and some

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:23,840
okay Summer of Code and OpenStack and

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:29,630
team interactions so which first Summer

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:33,470
of Code maybe we discuss it's slightly

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:36,140
plan to host plan to host its first on

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,750
some Vita machine possibly on info

00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,150
maniac

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:44,150
but we should also discuss what we do

00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:50,140
after each the project finishes

00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:50,140
basically who will take care of it if if

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:57,260
yes he's now part of the team he did I

00:22:54,289 --> 00:23:01,039
realize he signed up for life to say

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:03,760
that have you gathered enough key

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:07,280
signature so you can open an end process

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,460
so basically for we finish and all these

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,059
other basic that we plan for G sock we

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:16,940
need to create our users because so

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:20,450
everyone could post images and we don't

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,360
want that so we create our API as a key

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:26,780
that we need to give to people from the

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,059
call providers to use the finder this is

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,150
the first step the second one we have

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:33,950
already moved here because we need to

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,710
put in the Debian infrastructure and

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:41,570
first we use eco infrastructure to to

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:43,760
have people using it and I think this is

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:50,929
what we need to do to finish it is a lot

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:53,320
of work here and also I think yeah I

00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:57,340
think that that's it

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,050
I noticed you didn't ask answer the

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,220
question that you have lots of key

00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:11,410
signatures no I need it not yet oh oh

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:13,960
right don't run away we'll fix that then

00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,510
we will take care just to summarize in

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,510
wait you know what technology it is and

00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:26,280
how many people know this it's made in

00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:26,280
flask it's a Python yeah framework yeah

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:32,080
so I guess we have enough Python

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:34,240
knowledge in them maybe not flask but

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,740
and again I mean I remember it's one of

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,170
the discussions is we will need to

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,120
actually to plumb in so we have

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,650
information available about what we've

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,700
built that kind of thing at the moment

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:47,170
you just have a static list of images

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,100
but obviously again that's just a simple

00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:52,810
matter of programming can't be hard all

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,000
the documentation about the project we

00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:57,220
are doing is you know our wiki in

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,110
showing the cloud team there so you can

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,660
find everything all the all these prints

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,190
we are doing and also if you want to

00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:07,960
contribute to the project

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:11,020
everything is there ok them might be a

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,320
bit of packaging work if we want the

00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:17,590
leaves that he needs but not much maybe

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,110
it depends I mean a lot of the services

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,320
that Debian uses are not necessarily

00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,850
packaged it's good to have a packaged

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,070
but we don't have to run from packages

00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:33,340
for everything if nobody does the work I

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:37,570
will good but well volunteered ok at the

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:39,880
same time would it be good to sit for

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,730
few people and go for the code why we

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,580
are here I would be interested in sync

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:48,640
this may be not too much but at least to

00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,810
see how it looks and and get a feel for

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:57,280
the car yeah that sounds like a really

00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:59,830
good plan ok mm-hmm OpenStack and FAI so

00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,680
because this as far as I understand this

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:06,460
is the last set of images that are still

00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,150
built using all scripts sure so Bastian

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,000
does

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:12,809
of what he called no cloud images as in

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,850
no speck knows a specific platform

00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:19,360
images built which are basically just

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:21,790
like our OpenStack official images we

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,910
just didn't get around to moving over to

00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,470
those before Buster definitely

00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,530
definitely I would like to see this

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,150
before bullseye yeah because the

00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,100
OpenStack image works perfectly for

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:38,920
let's say dissolution and probably

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:42,760
others ago did you looked at the no

00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:46,570
cloud images so I had to look but as I

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:49,990
said earlier what I need is that if I

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:54,940
image to be published use the final

00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:57,340
result and test it okay so there there's

00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:00,570
no possibility to manual download the

00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:07,030
image and try to and give it a try yes

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:09,490
John Patterson I don't get what what is

00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:11,440
the blocking factor here I didn't

00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,860
understand and I want to write it so I

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,660
wanted to test the full chain of the CIA

00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,550
building the image publishing on

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,309
Patterson and then I can consume the

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,620
final product I didn't want to just try

00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:25,900
to build an image on my laptop that

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,660
probably will not detect something else

00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:33,309
as our infrastructure would be building

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:37,570
I thought that was too dangerous so yes

00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:39,790
we should Haley we should be pushing to

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,250
get or all of those images out on

00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:44,920
Patterson sooner rather than later so we

00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,840
can actually get this going just a

00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,390
question because I didn't see what we

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,410
have on the CI because what I had on

00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:56,530
this hood is that we already are we are

00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:59,290
already doing some images and where are

00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:01,570
those images like located can't you

00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:03,880
can't we use all right

00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,260
I genuinely don't know I don't think

00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,510
they've actually you've got anywhere

00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,700
beyond in Tulsa yeah I think I really

00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,200
have some artifacts in the salsa ci so

00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,010
you can go there and download them and

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,090
then see

00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:21,309
and use it but yeah it's not a very

00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:22,960
better soon yes yes so this is a

00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:26,200
confusing thing about the image of funny

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,500
because we need to know how where the

00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,540
images will be okay so I need to put a

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,610
link there Joe so we're missing one

00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,940
smallish piece of work that will then

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,700
make all of this happen so maybe we have

00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:44,290
already first work for first day of our

00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:53,799
Sprint's to be honest we should be able

00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:57,190
to do it before October okay okay this

00:28:53,799 --> 00:29:00,780
is already segwaying into workflow and

00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,780
comms and interactions isn't it

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,679
again we we need to do more of the

00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:10,990
becomes and interactions stuff we have

00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,910
genuinely there's been quite a lot of

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,590
work done but not everybody knows about

00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:17,710
all of it or knows where to look for the

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:21,010
results and much of the work sits on

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:26,290
sits on shoulders of two or three people

00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:30,790
bastions in show and mr5 the beads and

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:34,350
our students so let's improve on that

00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,350
this is something it's it's an ongoing

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:47,950
so I was hoping that we would get

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:51,220
Bastian here but oh well so we still

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:55,240
have 15 minutes so

00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:57,010
so should we discuss new modes of

00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,200
communication or something because we

00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:03,070
have IRC we have mainly English but

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:06,580
those are most for most times be quiet

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,170
and then and then I don't think there's

00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,510
necessarily anything wrong room is just

00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,640
we're not doing enough of it so that was

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,190
why I was trying to get the organization

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,340
going to at least have a have a monthly

00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:22,530
you know Meetup and to help drive that

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,530
kind of conversation so apologies

00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:33,370
volunteer I could try to take over this

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:37,120
so monthly meetings are ok which any

00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:40,270
proposals or any heart heart breaks for

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,760
time slots time zones or something so

00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,900
again I started this the only sensible

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,549
thing because of course a lot of the

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,890
people aren't here is talk on the

00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:49,750
mailing list ok and work it out from

00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,940
that way I mean you could do a doodle

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,679
poll or something but what I found was

00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:57,880
that didn't scale very well if you've

00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:00,340
got lots and lots of dates yeah so ok so

00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,350
I will try to come with something any

00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:06,960
mode of communication for those meetings

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:09,340
voice video just IRC something else

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,140
that's something to work out I mean I

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,880
think a lot of people happy with IRC

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,059
some people might prefer video some

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:26,980
people would hate video so we'll work it

00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:30,179
out I think over continence maybe IRC or

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:33,580
member would do but anything else

00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:36,700
yeah and they lie with the voice am i

00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,910
thankful ok and it boys could be painful

00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,530
with our with my horrible French accent

00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:47,820
and others might have the same trouble

00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:47,820
uh nobody understands a word I say

00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:54,010
so while we're on the subject to

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,950
communication and people doing stuff I

00:31:54,010 --> 00:32:00,370
am going to tell peor a few people know

00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:02,680
this already at the moment we have three

00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:08,170
delegates for the cloud team which is me

00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:10,930
and Thomas and Luca since I took on the

00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:13,390
delegation back in October I will admit

00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:15,310
I've been rubbish with lack of time that

00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,950
only got worse because I've picked up

00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:20,290
other hats in Debian so I'm gonna have

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,720
to apologize and say sorry guys I am

00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:24,190
going to resign from the delegation

00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:28,540
please don't take it personally I love

00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:30,490
all of you it's just the won't enough

00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:36,040
hours in the day and some of the other

00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:38,890
things I've got or even short of people

00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:43,410
than the cloud team so stuff like anti

00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:48,580
harassment and whatever decision to

00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:51,580
resign or no no I'm telling people today

00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,140
that I'm resigning as I said I'm still

00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,840
going to be around I can still answer

00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,490
questions but I genuinely asked us

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,830
because it's become obvious in the last

00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,960
few months I don't have the time to be

00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:05,140
able to drive things so it's clearly

00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,710
it's not fair for me to be you know for

00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:10,840
me to be in that position in the team I

00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:13,450
mean my wife for example has told sent

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:16,360
me to DEFCON from told me I need to drop

00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:18,130
some hats if I don't then you'll never

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:29,020
hear from me again because she'll murder

00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:32,080
me and bury me in the back garden that

00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:37,300
is a very good question it's something

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:39,460
for the team to work out the process

00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:42,040
that we went through for the delegation

00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:45,130
last year I think still has value and

00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:48,460
the rules that we worked out of not

00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:50,200
having people delegated who are you have

00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,330
potential conflict of interest

00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,570
like for example commercial interest in

00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:58,360
one of the platforms that kind of thing

00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:00,350
and that was how Thomas and Luka and I

00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,270
ended up here

00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:05,809
now of course we have another problem

00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:08,570
that Luca is also conspicuously not here

00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:10,940
again not that he's not a lovely guy and

00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,580
huh and what doesn't want to help but he

00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:16,339
is also totally swamped with with day

00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,320
job responsibilities at the moment so I

00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:20,500
would also be tempted to ask him if he's

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,730
still around and wanting to stay in I

00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,770
appreciate it does it it doesn't look

00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:27,109
great if maybe two of the three

00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,089
delegates are looking to move on after

00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:31,040
less than a year but there's no point in

00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:37,250
having people around who can't leave

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:41,169
don't have the time all right any other

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,169
comments around that or do we move on I

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:48,169
guess talking about docker and vagrant

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:50,359
images we have some people here that

00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:53,419
were interested in this kind of thing so

00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:56,330
I put this in the agenda so I don't know

00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:59,540
you can start the discussion does

00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,310
anybody know how we should because in

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,800
docker there are two phases one is this

00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:06,530
base image and then there is docker file

00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,849
who who is used to build something on

00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,890
the top of docker so I guess we are

00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:12,140
talking to that Debian should provide

00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:15,109
this base image so everybody from that

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,510
be an official whatever whatever and I

00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:20,270
have no idea how it's built initially

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,460
and I have no idea how how to build

00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:24,920
vagrant I never even use backgrounds so

00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:28,480
as much as I know the docker image were

00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:33,770
made very full Tagliamonte until now and

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:37,280
if is he still doing it yeah I was gonna

00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:39,349
say I know there are official Debian

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,510
docker in docker base images but beyond

00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:44,869
that I don't know he's actually taking

00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:46,400
care of that it does seem to be in all

00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:49,160
the right places on the on the docker

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,430
hub so so people find them and are using

00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,070
them and buster's there and so on it's

00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,230
all there

00:35:54,070 --> 00:36:00,770
so I have both docker images and vagrant

00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:03,740
images there are my basic tooling and

00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:06,950
now the images that that are in docker

00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:08,839
hub are built by docker itself so I

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,010
don't know how that works but they do

00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:14,550
the image

00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:19,160
they usually lag a week or so from

00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:22,770
testing and and I build my own images

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:32,730
weekly so would be no effort for me to

00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:36,290
to take on these roles so we have

00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:38,760
discussions around this area in the past

00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:40,829
again one of the reasons we wanted to

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,130
get a delegation for the cloud team was

00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:46,050
so we could actually have some official

00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:48,770
responsibility for producing official

00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:52,619
Debian images and we could set policies

00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:55,070
there are no similar policies around the

00:36:52,619 --> 00:37:01,160
docker images of vagrant images yet I

00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:01,160
genuinely think that is a problem as

00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:06,839
what are the official docker images and

00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:10,230
vagrant images and who's responsible for

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:13,230
them is there any way on those platforms

00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:15,630
I'll admit blatantly I've never used the

00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,609
vagrant images even once but for example

00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:21,750
is there any way is there any control

00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:23,609
over the images do we know how they're

00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,380
built do we have sources for them you

00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:28,530
know all of the usual good stuff that we

00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,900
worry about in Debian it's difficult to

00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:33,450
tell these things on some of the newer

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,460
platforms and we should be worrying

00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:37,200
about that I'd love to be told don't

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,290
worry about it it just works here's our

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,819
policies here's where how we do it I'm

00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:46,950
not optimistic living which I you can

00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:50,700
tell me is there a way to check that the

00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:55,410
official docker image has the right

00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:57,950
checksum yes okay so it didn't make

00:37:55,410 --> 00:38:01,109
sense that we publish it

00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,970
concerning the vagrant image I remember

00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:06,810
we had the discussion at the cloud

00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:10,079
sprint and we were not sure what's so

00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:14,040
special with the vagrant images is it's

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,800
vagrant a sort of image or is vagrant

00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,260
just the tool to build whatever image

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,230
and I think we also looked into the

00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,690
configuration and there were some very

00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:28,230
strange things like

00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:31,950
counts with no password are some

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:34,860
hard-coded things so so it would be good

00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:38,400
if people that are using vagrant would

00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:47,580
look at our no cloud images and would

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:49,980
say would that fit their use cases so

00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:53,340
the problem as of today with vagrant the

00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:56,250
images is they they are not updated so

00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:59,870
the last time I tried to use the the

00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:05,040
vagrant image that is in fabulous name

00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:07,320
it was like six month without update so

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:13,380
I don't know who's mounting that account

00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:13,770
but they're going image must have highly

00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,180
called

00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:21,090
SSH keys because this is how it works

00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:28,560
the vagrant media tube for example it's

00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:32,580
has a command like SSH into the the en

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:36,720
or other things so it's a no call image

00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:40,140
kind of work here it's not just like

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:45,420
kuma imagery it's box image or

00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:47,250
liberal XE images but I have another

00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:52,860
problem for the there were images

00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:56,370
it's a hosted on the high scope crowd

00:39:52,860 --> 00:40:01,380
mmm but it's it's it can also hold on

00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:05,280
our foreign port been daughter or sites

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:09,350
because it has the future like external

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,350
source for the background image

00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:20,900
okay sorry can you repeat last sentence

00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:22,850
I lost it because basically you started

00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,400
mentioning something about Hoshi Corp

00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:32,630
but I didn't get this so let me write

00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:42,440
this on notes along the copy I will

00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:46,040
write down the copy myself okay what

00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:50,080
about the hard-coded SSH keys that host

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:53,660
keys are for the root account

00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,600
I've been public if on account the the

00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:59,120
basic idea is that Varun has a post

00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,130
provisioning face right so you'll write

00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,330
your variant file and you are going to

00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:10,010
like for example we stall some server

00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:12,830
Apache - so when it first boots it uses

00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:15,080
our hard-coded SSH key to provision the

00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:18,140
machine and after provision it generates

00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,990
a new unique SSH key just for that

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:24,410
installation of the image so if you have

00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:27,290
10 different Debian images up in your

00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:29,900
machine you'll have 10 different keys on

00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:31,700
each but just in the first time when

00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,960
we'll have no internet to access nothing

00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:39,380
it uses a hard code key to provision so

00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,690
so this is an image that is not ready to

00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,640
go because you have to do some very

00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,820
important things during the first boot

00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,820
up

00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:53,780
generating SSH host keys we also do this

00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:56,690
in I think all the other images that

00:41:53,780 --> 00:42:01,550
during the first boot up I think maybe

00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:03,800
cloud Amit toughness that unique SSH

00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:12,110
keys are generated but what else is done

00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:14,090
for important for vagrant image now

00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,320
authorize key to a search into this as

00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:18,650
throat or something okay

00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:22,130
so I guess this is like I wrote it's a

00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:24,260
bit like ansible so you SSH into this

00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:27,510
and then install something and then it's

00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:29,250
supposed to be delete this key but we

00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:32,430
to check this basically but there's

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:36,770
nothing special about a vagrant image so

00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:39,109
basically it's just a seal W file or

00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:41,850
[Music]

00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:46,440
image no nothing special

00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:54,450
okay we have just one minute left so any

00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:59,340
last remarks last comments mic so

00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:04,140
basically we are actually doing hard

00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:07,830
drive images for some usage though the

00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:11,220
cloud may be not fully the only place

00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:14,910
where we need that I'm thinking about

00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:24,810
for example the recipe images so does

00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:28,320
that have a space in our gym we were

00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:31,350
sitting me Helen Steve and somebody else

00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:33,690
I forgot in Taiwan and we went through

00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,730
these city built scripts and so on

00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:38,820
because we were hoping to somehow

00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:42,090
integrate this it didn't work out but

00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:47,490
maybe it would be not bad idea to return

00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:51,780
to this to return to this and try to

00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:56,880
think because there is much overlap with

00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:58,470
those issues what I was wondering if we

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,750
could get because like we are targeting

00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:06,240
some the biggest called provider for now

00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,940
but what I would like to see in as is a

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,570
process in infrastructure where if

00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:15,060
another cloud provider want to be added

00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:18,570
in this to just submit Apache people

00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,940
discuss and arrange things and then we

00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:23,240
publish image in their daughter called

00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,240
provide

00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:42,520
I think that the current situation is

00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:46,650
that if somebody says I want to have a

00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:49,470
special cloud image just grab the

00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:52,720
configuration the file configuration

00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:56,890
make your customization and send us a

00:44:52,720 --> 00:45:00,730
merge request then then our goal was to

00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:04,839
provide a tooling with the configuration

00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:06,970
so people can create customized things

00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:09,460
maybe we should promote this much more

00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:11,619
that there's a configuration space

00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,420
there's tooling you can just use it on

00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:15,670
your local machine or in your local

00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,640
cloud environment and if you are happy

00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:23,980
with it just send us patches for your

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:27,040
special custom configuration yeah I've

00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:29,020
already been pointing people start oh

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,730
yeah yeah I've been pointing people at

00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,790
what we have already when they've been

00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,530
asking about how to do certain things so

00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:37,599
we already have quite a number of people

00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:41,230
who are bowing what we're doing and this

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,420
is awesome yeah we should definitely

00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:46,839
carry on with that and men make more

00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:51,520
noise about it I think we're out of time

00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:53,319
so thank you everyone

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,390
this discussion is clearly going to

00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:58,859
carry on going you know where to find us

00:45:55,390 --> 00:46:01,630
the Debian cloud list hash Debian cloud

00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:04,780
cloud team in south-south the cloud team

00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:08,430
in Tulsa yeah tomash is going to be

00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:12,010
trying to organize when mommy shops and

00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:15,329
also let's get going on the sprint for

00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,329
