UEFI Secure Boot has been a long journey in Debian

We started talking about it in 2012, maybe earlier.

We now have it up and running, on 3 different architectures. Let's celebrate that.

Some topics to discuss:

- why did it take so long?
- how does it work?
- what are the implications?
- should you trust it?
- what happens next?
