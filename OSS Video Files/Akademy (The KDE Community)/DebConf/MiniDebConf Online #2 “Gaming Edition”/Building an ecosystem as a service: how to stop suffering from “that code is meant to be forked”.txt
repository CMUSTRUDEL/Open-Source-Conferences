Earlier idTech engines were well known to have seen their source code opened when they were replaced and thus unprofitable. While this was a huge benefit for the mankind, game developers still suffer today with design choices and mindset induced from the fact such code base was meant to die. 20 years later we will focus on idTech3 heritage, how both the market, open source communities and game development practices evolved, and embark in the journey of the required transition from dead code dump to an ecosystem as a service.
