	                              hello everybody                               so when we opened up we had some                               organizers on the stream                               those were the more european african                               afternoon people and now we have                               more of the late team in the closing so                               that's great that we have                               more coverage of the entire team                               although there's a few people who                                couldn't make it on here                                so uh usually we like to plan something                                elaborate for an ending                                this time we haven't we were just                                working up until the last second trying                                to get this conference together                                and uh fortunately it turned out very                                well                                so um when this idea first came about we                                thought it was just going to be                                something very                                quirky and loose but fortunately thanks                                to                                to everyone who came together and worked                                on this                                this ended up being a very nice                                conference                                and especially thanks to the speakers                                who                                really made exceptionally nice talks                                there were a few talks with                                which i thought might be more like fluff                                or something                                to fully schedule but all of those that                                i thought would be like that were really                                detailed and professional and lots of                                technical content                                and it was just really impressive so                                especially to all the speakers a huge                                thank you um                                it was just fantastic and a good                                surprise to get                                then also thank you to all the                                organizers the people in this                                call as well um it was great seeing                                everyone work together take                                responsibility for their                                part of work and                                apparently that's very funny but                                but yeah that was fantastic the content                                team the video team

                               voltage                                or anyone else on this channel and they                                can funnel it through                                or

the credits page as well                                then videos the video team is busy                                uploading videos to the devcon video                                archive                                as we speak that's the link where you'll                                find it                                it's also in the topic of the irc                                channel and uh                                i'm not sure exactly when they'll be on                                patreon youtube                                but i think the review is basically                                more or less finished so it shouldn't be                                too long before they make it up to today                                either                                and if you this park isn't there yet so                                yeah i said soon so that could mean                                i don't know                                and if um understand portuguese next                                weekend there's another mini dead con                                but unfortunately just in portuguese                                fortunately in portuguese because we                                have a big community in brazil                                and around the world they speak                                portuguese so if you are one of the                                lucky ones to understand portuguese                                and there's lots of good talks already                                scheduled for that weekend as well                                so uh yeah mini dev con is already back                                next weekend                                so uh make it make it worth my while                                 having made that shout out                                 yeah you've seen latin wonderful                                 portuguese

um mention that as well and then we can                                 get more people into the talk and we can                                 see if we can crash jitsi
