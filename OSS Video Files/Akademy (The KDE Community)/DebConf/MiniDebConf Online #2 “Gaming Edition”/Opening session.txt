	                              hello everybody welcome                               to the mini upconf live to the gaming                               edition                               and we're about to do an introductory                               video and after that some of the team                               members will say hi                               hi and after months of planning welcome                               to mini dabcon for online                               gaming edition why a gaming mini dev                                conf well                                we had our first online mini dev conf in                                may this year                                in part that was due to the covett                                   pandemic and also in part because we                                want to improve                                our online collaboration tools we also                                want to make debkan better for remote                                participants                                and what better way to do that than to                                make deb con                                remote for just everyone we took a very                                bare bones approach to it                                but it turned out to be fun and                                productive and we already decided that                                we want to do more online mini detcoms                                at some point in the future                                then it was decided that devconf                                      going to be an entirely online event                                so we quickly worked on improving the                                stack stefano even quickly wrote a new                                front-end for vocto called vogel                                this is what we used to mix our live                                stream with                                here's a screenshot of that our video                                team members will be somewhat familiar                                with that                                already so mini debk confront line was                                a general debian weekend just like all                                the mini debcons that happened in the                                past                                but there were also a few ideas for                                themed events                                i hope that all of these will and more                                will work out at some point but i went                                ahead and proposed the gaming event                                because there's so much happening in the                                space right now                                and i think the timing is right for us                                to speak about it too                                although that still doesn't answer the                                question why is game is a good topic to                                cover                                well things changed fast and they                                certainly have in recent years                                if you think back to about                                           the gaming world on a pc was heavily                                windows dominated                                mac os got steam later in the decade and                                started to look like it could take a                                take on windows                                and probably even be a close to second                                choice for gamers                                since then things have regressed                                somewhat in the proprietary operating                                system world                                when it comes to games and in the free                                software world some significant strides                                have been made for it                                so i think the playing field is slowly                                starting to level out                                and i think there's potential for debian                                to really shine as a gaming platform                                over the next decade or so so                                let's talk about max a little even                                though mac os looked like a promising                                platform for gamers a decade ago                                that quickly eroded again since a                                significant change was when they dropped                                support for                                            this is quite a big hit for some game                                libraries since many games in the last                                decade before that                                were                                                                   can't even run                                            on on those mac os systems anymore                                then apple also decided to phase out                                opengl in favor of their metal framework                                game developers did not like this                                because this meant a lot of extra work                                would have to go in for them for a                                relatively small segment of users                                so many games simply didn't get ported                                over anymore                                a huge problem in max is also some                                seemingly planned obsolescence in terms                                of hardware operating system support                                i admit owning a mac mini and a few                                years ago i wanted to upgrade it                                and it said that the latest os x that i                                 could run on there                                 was only up to                                                       perfectly capable                                                     enough ram to run the latest                                 system they wouldn't allow to upgrade                                 and you could install it with some hacks                                 but i just never had the time to do so                                 this quickly turns into a problem                                 because like in this headline that i                                 pasted in that image                                 once your operating system gets too old                                 because your hardware is too old                                 you can't actually run the latest                                 versions of your                                 game library or stores anymore and                                 you lose a lot of your games that you're                                 able to install                                 because of that then                                 valve also dropped mac os support for                                 steamvr                                 steam's virtual reality platform with                                 the intent to purely focus                                 on windows and linux and from i haven't                                 used it myself but from what i've seen                                 on the internet                                 it seems to work quite well on linux                                 systems                                 then they also announced earlier this                                 month that they're moving entirely                                 to their new on-based m                                                  in itself a bad thing at all                                 but it's not great for compatibility                                 current x                                        that's compiled in xcode will be able to                                 compile                                 to a new binary that can run on both                                 platforms                                 but the vast majority of x                                              only be able to run                                 under a very slow emulation mode which                                 might be fine for very old                                 x                                                                    ones                                 as a side note this also seems to be                                 quite an issue for docker users                                 on these machines                                 i could go on and on about mac problems                                 gaming but we haven't even talked about                                 all the problems with the app store yet                                 or issues with side loading apps or                                 how at least according to early reviews                                 the bootloader is locked on the new arm                                 based max                                 so you won't even be able to deal with                                 linux on it                                 but this conference isn't about bashing                                 mac this section is merely to show that                                 apple computers just                                 aren't as good a choice for gamers                                 anymore as it used to be                                 and i could delve into windows problems                                 too but we just don't have the time                                 right now                                 let's instead talk about the penguin                                 stuff                                 well this year is just weird while linux                                 market share is steadily climbing                                 it may meant it was reported to double                                 that's at a much faster rate                                 than the previous trajectory then in                                 july                                 it had a very slight dip again there                                 were lots of speculation on what could                                 cause this                                 and whether the new stats might just be                                 a correction on the previous numbers                                 but it seems like there was a very                                 strong correlation in upswing of linux                                 use                                 when people stayed at home for lockdowns                                 and then it goes                                 down little again when they go back to                                 work                                 it looks like staying at home was an                                 opportunity for many people to try out                                 linux                                 and more linux home users create more                                 demand for linux games                                 and then there's stuff that happened in                                 the linux world over the last decade                                 that were quite big                                 a great balkan come along and proton                                 and a bunch of technologies it has these                                 and x's and v's and codes in them                                 many proprietary gaming engines now                                 support linux in the top dozen or so of                                 them                                 they will support linux a huge list of                                 newer free game engines                                 were released godow is one example that                                 we'll cover a bit this weekend                                 many all the proprietary engines are                                 implemented as free software                                 and i think that's great because it's                                 also a way to preserve                                 all the games and i would also encourage                                 game authors to release as much of their                                 content as they can                                 um as free licenses because it's a great                                 way to preserve games for future                                 generations as well                                 old creator tools that's been around for                                 a long time like blender and                                 just keeps getting better by huge leaves                                 and new ones like pixlrama and krita                                 also have emerged i mean pixel aroma is                                 covered                                 during mini depth camp this weekend and                                 even though krita has been around                                 a while it's it's kind of gained like a                                 critical mass of popularity                                 recently there's also many emulators                                 for nearly any console or system you                                 could think of in deviant                                 and technologies like qmukvm has also                                 come a really long way                                 and some useful features for gamers like                                 pci pass through so that you can pass                                 through your gpu                                 to a virtual machine if needed and                                 that's all really great stuff                                 but we also haven't figured everything                                 out yet                                 we know that debit isn't perfect this is                                 an unexhaustive list                                 we know that stable releases aren't                                 great for the latest hardware                                 just yesterday colleague of mine was                                 installing debian on a new ryzen machine                                 and it just wasn't possible if stable                                 even though there's a backboard                                 repository                                 which generally works great we need to                                 do better with hardware enablement                                 unstable releases there's still lots of                                 game related software and games not                                 packaged for debian                                 so we need more contributors but getting                                 started with contributing to debian in                                 itself can be tough                                 and we are working on making that better                                 as well so consider getting involved                                 there's probably lots of areas where you                                 can help with                                 so in a nutshell we've really come a                                 long long way                                 but i think it's just early days and                                 that the best is here to come                                 so join us and be part of this change                                 we also have a code of conduct during                                 this conference                                 you can get all the details of this url                                 take a screenshot of that now if you can                                 just to have the information handy                                 but in a nutshell be nice to others and                                 contact                                 community debian.org if you run into any                                 problems                                 also important don't stress if english                                 isn't your first language                                 or if you're not that fluent in it                                 that's true for many of us in the                                 project                                 and in this conference and then
