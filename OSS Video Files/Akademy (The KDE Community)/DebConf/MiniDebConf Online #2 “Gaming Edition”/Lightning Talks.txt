	                              hello                               welcome to lightning talks we have a                               small but hopefully very well formed                               session                               we've got peter urbeck and                               our fearless leader jonathan in that                               order                               so go ahead peter                               thank you thank you very much                                i would like to talk quickly about a                                topic i ran into                                a few years ago when i looked at the                                gaming status in debian                                and what i tried to do was to                                install all the games in debian on one                                machine for my kids to play around with                                and i discovered that the                                menu location of the games in debian                                hasn't received a lot of attention                                from the maintainers at least not the                                coherent attention from the maintainers                                so the                                position in the menu for different games                                was not quite                                obvious you would have to look around                                quite a bit to actually find the games                                you installed                                which is kind of painful for uh                                graphical user interface users like my                                kids um for example if you installed all                                the strategy games there is a meta                                packet for strategy games in debian                                you would expect all the games to show                                up in this strategy sub menu                                but they do not and                                that's rather strange i think um                                that's just one example the location of                                games                                do not really match their topic and or                                type of game at all so basically random                                where you find a game after installing                                it                                where you find it in the menu after                                installing it so                                the point of this talk is simply to                                remind                                the game maintainers in debian to try to                                install the game and check where it ends                                up in the menu                                and of course also to make sure that                                it makes sense and                                if you are going to                                to                                pick a menu alternative you should also                                make sure it is um                                there we have it it uh it makes sense                                compared to or                                next to all the other games in debian                                i'm showing here a menu                                desktop entry and this is a                                random one but here you you can see that                                the categories which is controlling the                                location in the                                kde menu and no menu and probably all                                the other menus                                is trying its best but                                even with the game and simulation in                                place                                in my kde menu it shows up in the root                                of the game menu and not in a subsection                                for                                simulations                                i would like the game team to actually                                install all the games in debian and have                                a look at the                                collection of menu entries to make sure                                they work                                and make sense together that's the only                                way i know to actually                                make sure these menu entries                                make sense                                in addition to the menu location it's                                also very nice if the                                program itself is able to open its own                                save files if they have one                                i often see programs unable to open                                their own programs                                using the graphical file browser which                                is very painful for                                start well beginners and                                graphical user interface users and to do                                that you actually need to specify                                the menu the the mime type for the                                programs and the mime time for the files                                both in the uh                                for sure call it the desktop mime type                                registration catalog                                and in the desktop entry for the program                                these things are trivial they are                                 very simple to do and they are                                 regularly overlooked by command line                                 users like myself                                 because we never see this information we                                 never use this information                                 and we kind of get the feeling                                 from our own personal experience that                                 they are not an important part of the                                 packet but they really are an important                                 part of the package for beginners                                 please remember this                                 and that's all i have to say on the                                 topic any questions                                 just looking at the ilc um                                 [Music]                                 nope i think it's mostly well the one                                 common the one question was is gamer                                 lightning real but uh yes it is                                 but we're going to leave that question                                 like hanging there anyway                                 okay thank you for the attention thank                                 you for the talk                                 uh next up is erbec                                 yes not that i actually prepared                                 something                                 yesterday i was asked if i could do                                 something                                 i was thinking okay two days ago i was                                 on debbie and mentors and i found this                                 so funny                                 and                                 basically it was yeah i did a package                                 and i did it                                 absolutely the opposite way it is                                 circumvented and that everything                                 differently than they told me and it                                 doesn't work can you help me                                 and basically i was told something like                                 yeah                                 never do this again don't upload                                 substandard heart mental crap to the                                 archive                                 and everyone will hate you                                 and then                                                     oh i'm sorry i was thinking you're an                                 uploading diddy                                 so if you want to really know how bad                                 your packages are                                 then put an ad debian or email address                                 in your                                 as a maintainer and then you will get to                                 know the full truth                                 and yeah somehow yesterday i found this                                 funny                                 right now i'm not sure but actually as                                 they find it funny                                 cool and that's actually it's not enough                                 to fill a lightning talk                                 that was a package that you you didn't                                 use any dip helper at all you put it                                 together by hand using                                 all the lowest level tools that can                                 possibly                                 exist so like i can see how that can can                                 these days break a few things along the                                 way                                 but i'm sure it's like interesting as a                                 proof of concept of                                 something yeah actually it took i think                                 one week worked                                 then there was one dab camp like thingy                                 in italy it took                                 almost the whole three or four days                                 it was a lot of fun and was very painful                                 then then i uploaded it                                 and it basically fdbfs on all                                 architecture                                 then i fixed it but by fixing it i did                                 something else wrong                                 and then i figured out                                 you need to fix anything else so                                 actually you are you                                 are all the time fixing what you have                                 done wrongly and                                 instead of doing something what makes                                 sense                                 but in a way it's fine maybe if anything                                 you're now a cautionary tale                                 you've set an example that you know                                 sometimes it's actually better to go the                                 easy route and the more                                 you know take the roads more commonly                                 traveled when it comes to packaging and                                 putting things together yeah actually                                 i'm                                 almost convinced i really should convert                                 it                                 to something else which package was that                                 it was named braille font oh okay                                 it's actually you can make metal                                 signatures and                                 yeah actually it's a nice program yeah                                 it does sound interesting                                 oh it's a program not not a font                                 no okay i saw that                                 i use a debian logo made out of braille                                 that someone else made that i just                                 copied and pasted in my                                 email signature and that's quite nice so                                 it's kind of cool to know that                                 there's a tool available to actually                                 draw those things with                                 it converts letters to bitmaps                                 and then prints them using the the                                 browser both                                 from unicode okay cool and because                                 it does not use everything but                                 see standard library it kind of                                 invites people to do weird experiments                                 with it                                 with the answer and packaging techniques                                 and so you can take any emoji and also                                 turn that into like a                                 braille well-drawn division                                 it's mostly ascii and some german and                                 in french it's it's very basic                                 cool                                 oh yeah the question is if i would                                 recommend doing this                                 yeah the question yeah i would recommend                                 building such a package because it's                                 lots of fun                                 but i'm not sure if i would recommend                                 uploading it to the archive i guess so i                                 don't know what                                 i think this is where we get back to the                                 proof of concept thing maybe                                 well in the in the new maintainer                                 process when you become an uploaded dd                                 there are some questions that                                 that rely on you doing that from scratch                                 so that you can answer some of those                                 questions so                                 in the past they asked you                                 to convert one of your packages back to                                 using                                 node paper and other people claim this                                 is hazing and why don't you                                 ask people to clean the apartment using                                 a toothbrush                                 now i think it's important to know the                                 the primitives of of what the                                 it's not that it's even that ex that                                 complicated when you deep that                                 go that deep um but i think it's                                 important to know                                 now at least at last you said one time                                 how that works                                 i think it's fun i'm not sure if it's a                                 good idea to force someone to do this in                                 the unm process                                 and it's not really done anymore yeah                                 but actually i've i found it fun                                 so                                 but it's maybe if                                 if no one else does it this way and then                                 you tell someone you need to do it                                 that's maybe not                                 yeah i don't think it's it's important i                                 don't think it's good to recommend that                                 someone tries that                                 i think it would be interesting to tell                                 people it's possible                                 and you know if they want to satisfy                                 their own curiosity                                 yeah and you also have what i resource                                 as a challenge rather than as a as a                                 requirement                                 yeah i understood better how these tools                                 work like their purpose and what they do                                 behind and what i found most interesting                                 that                                 nowadays there is automatic debug                                 packages                                 it's actually possible to manually build                                 them                                 and still let the system tweak into that                                 they are built automatically                                 you just need to look in the source code                                 i'm not sure if it was step helper or                                 the age                                 so actually one learns a lot from it but                                 if you try to maintain a package this                                 way then                                 it's really painful and people hate you                                 and on that bombshell can i continue to                                 my                                 my section of the lightning talk yes                                 okay i'm going to shave my screen                                 i think this is something that people                                 will find more fun than what ubik is                                 proposing                                 so um there's a sketchbook caesar                                                                             it was a lot of fun one of the nicest                                 isometric city builders                                 of the                                                                   say about it yeah you're in                                 ancient rome you basically rebuild rome                                 city by city                                 it's got really high ratings as well                                 with a very popular game                                 so um it runs fine in wine                                 i think i played it through about a year                                 ago in wine and it worked perfectly                                 but um playing old games on modern                                 machines have some                                 huge limitations like you could only run                                 it at four                                 to three aspect ratios it only went up                                 to                                            and even switching between it and other                                 apps is kind of clunky and had some                                 issues                                 so someone wrote open source                                 implementation of its game engine                                 called julius it works really well                                 and you can get you can play it at                                 native resolution                                 it it's easier to to handle in your                                 desktop                                 the and it's complete                                 it uses like the original data file so                                 not it's not a complete open source game                                 by itself even though the engine is open                                 source                                 and it also aims to be completely true                                 to the original game so the original                                 gameplay all the                                 original buildings everything is                                 preserved as is                                 it's just uh even the original artwork                                 on the load screen and everything                                 it just runs a bit better on a modded                                 machine                                 and you can see it's running at my                                 native screen resolution                                 and running just fine okay to exit it                                 again                                 but then some people felt that you know                                 it's                                 in its in its form it's such a good game                                 to begin with it would actually be nice                                 to add                                 more buildings more features to it than                                 just the original                                 um game that existed so there's another                                 fork of julius called                                 augustus and they aim to extend the game                                 and make it to stuff that the original                                 game                                 couldn't do you see the list of stuff                                 that it can do you can make roadblocks                                 so that uh your citizens are doing                                 specific work don't go                                 walking somewhere that they're not                                 actually                                 useful and not the work they should be                                 doing you can give market special orders                                 uh and some other things the zoom                                 controls is really nice i'm going to                                 quickly load                                 augustus and then i can show you what                                 that looks like to                                 so this is augustus you can know the                                 same you can load your                                 caesar three and julius saved games in                                 augustus                                 but once you've saved the game in                                 augustus then it has extra data that                                 can't be used in all the games so you                                 should ideally not save your                                 save games that you want to import again                                 from augustus                                 so um game pretty much looks the same                                 but                                 like it mentioned in the wizard                                 marketplace like it mentioned in the                                 github page you can give the market uh                                 special instructions to go accept food                                 or go fetch it or not ex oh just accept                                 or not accept                                 um i only played this loaded this the                                 first time today so this is new to me                                 too                                 but what i really like about the um                                 augustus vision is you can zoom in and                                 out so you can almost see your whole                                 city                                 if you this is a very small city but you                                 can zoom very far                                 out and scroll or you can zoom in a lot                                 and see what your                                 city looks like and and what people are                                 doing                                 um a pop-up just that i accidentally                                 just dismissed that said something about                                 my soldiers being hungry so that's also                                 an add-on to                                 augustus so you have to feed your                                 soldiers make them have some kind of                                 food                                 they're close to close to their barracks                                 so                                 also you get this nifty status that                                 saves our culture and prosperity and pcs                                 so that you don't have to go to the menu                                 to see                                 what you need to do to win this level                                 and                                 there's a bunch of new stuff as well so                                 you can build a grand temple instead of                                 just a small or large                                 i also noticed a bunch of new where was                                 it                                 you can build a bunch of different trees                                 and parks and                                 paths that doesn't exist in the original                                 game                                 so let me just exit that again so that's                                 in a nutshell what                                 uh julius and augustus is um                                 just a free free engine fork of the                                 original caesar three game and                                 both of them have app images available                                 they run just fine that's what i used                                 and i know there's also a packaging                                 effect to get                                 at least julius into debian and i guess                                 once julius is packaged in                                 august this is probably not far behind                                 and uh yeah that's
