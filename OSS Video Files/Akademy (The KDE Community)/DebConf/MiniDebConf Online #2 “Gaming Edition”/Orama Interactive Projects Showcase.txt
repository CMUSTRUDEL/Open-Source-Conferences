We are Orama Interactive, an independent game and software developer team. We have a passion for meaningful videogames, and libre software. In this talk, we will talk a bit about our projects, which include various games and a pixel art editor. We will go into detail about who we are, why we are doing what we do, the stories and the future plans of our projects, and how they are currently standing.

Specifically, we will talk about 3 of our games, Where hope lies, a VR puzzle game, Repairing, a pixel art platformer game and Τechnotribal, a game mixing the quiz and puzzle genres. We will also have a closer look to Pixelorama, our currently in active development free and open source pixel art sprite editor
