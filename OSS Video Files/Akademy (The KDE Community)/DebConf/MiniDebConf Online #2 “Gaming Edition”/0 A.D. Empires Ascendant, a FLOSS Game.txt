This talk will cover the basics about 0 A.D: Empires Ascendant, the game itself, the number of users, the team behind, the biggest mods, then we'll dive more into the things we use under the hood, from C++ libraries to the contributing platform and CI, hosting. 

Then I'll answer questions during the remaining time, and I can go more in depth about specific topics.
