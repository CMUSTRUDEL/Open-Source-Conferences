**Introduction**
Presentation and talk about general state of linux gaming and the tools we have to make Libre games and Opensource games.

**The talk**
The talk will be about assets in game and specifically about music and sounds in games done with free tools. Sometimes to achieve good quality production you need to use other non free tools too.

It's important to know which tools we have and how to improve them offering an alternative to commercial well known tools out there.

	                              hello everyone and welcome                               to the mini debian conference                                    gaming edition                               i'm francesco and today i want to talk                               to you about a topic that i really found                               interesting                               this topic is about music and sound                               assets in open source games and libra                               games                                i'm a musician and a composer too and                                actually i compose                                music and soundtracks for video games                                focusing                                especially on open source games and                                liver games i also ran a twitch channel                                featuring                                open source games only and i did this                                just to spread awareness about open                                source software                                and to promote open source games that                                are very very cool                                and are out there just they just wait to                                be discovered by people                                i have many years of experience in                                recording studios                                and all the people that i met nobody                                knew                                about linux and nobody cared about linux                                actually they told most of the times                                that                                it was too difficult to to use and they                                never think about using linux as                                main production system to produce music                                and work on music                                so this is the main reason why people                                don't use                                linux today or at least not the majority                                of people                                i am thinking about for example to                                ubuntu studio that's actually very easy                                to                                understand very easy to utilize and it                                was made                                having music in mind but today it's                                difficult to explain to                                people or friends that linux is                                also and can be very very                                user friendly many developers just don't                                support linux                                and that's bad music people just want to                                use the best software out there                                and most of it is not available on linux                                unfortunately                                so actually i discovered linux many                                years ago                                like seven eight years ago and i fell in                                love with it                                it was also my first experience with                                open source game                                because i discovered the battle for                                wesnot and i played                                on that game many many hours that was                                just a very very particular experience                                for me                                i installed linux on my old netbook and                                that was very very slow                                that was a cheap machine and now                                i just switched to linux on all my                                machines                                and i run linux on my laptop                                that i used to play live on stage and on                                my                                main machine here that i used to compute                                music and compose soundtracks                                so after i saw the linux on all my                                machines                                i wiped off windows from all of them                                and that's because i think linux is just                                better                                so we also have to talk about linux                                gaming                                linux gaming is sort of good and i think                                that it's improving over time                                you know there are many people out there                                that are doing                                a great job actually promoting linux for                                gaming like                                anthony from ltt and i think that is a                                good good step                                towards promoting linux as a good system                                to have games and play games i also                                think that                                having commercial games on linux it's                                also very important to promote                                open source games themselves when i                                discovered linux i actually wanted to                                play to my favorite games                                so i started to play to counter strike                                global offensive                                 hollow knight and many many games like                                 that                                 they had native linux support                                 on steam so that was easy to play                                 but after i started to play those games                                 i actually found                                 many open source games or libra games                                 and i'm still playing these games today                                 because                                 i think that they serve more attention                                 so those games were built with having a                                 different                                 philosophy in mind and that's a cool                                 thing so i think that people                                 can discover and learn things about                                 linux and open source software                                 just playing their favorite games and                                 after                                 that they can learn about things that                                 matter the most like open through                                 software labor software                                 that could help linux to grow and                                 actually                                 could bring more people that can help                                 in development of linux games and                                 audio application actually so i like                                 many many open source games like                                 valir tier battle for west not mind                                 three red eclipse two                                 and sonoric freerider rpg i play them                                 all                                 and i am playing more and more open                                 source games on my                                 twitch channel to promote those games                                 today we have many tools that we can use                                 to produce music                                 on linux i still think that professional                                 tools                                 are needed if you need to do                                 professional music and professional                                 audio production                                 by the way many free tools are reaching                                 a                                 really good quality level and                                 there are many of them available on                                 linux that are good enough                                 if you need one of those professional                                 tools available                                 on windows only you can still use wine                                 and use one of the vst bridges that                                 are out there and they work really well                                 for example i sometimes i need to use                                 some simple libraries                                 that come with property software and                                 property plugins                                 and i need them forced to use those                                 bridges but fortunately enough wine                                 works really really well with those                                 plugins                                 so the digital audio workstation ordo                                 is one of the most important piece of                                 software that we need                                 to produce music actually you can                                 produce music                                 and record music without digital audio                                 workstation                                 but actually only if you produce music                                 in analog without using                                 digital at all if you use a computer if                                 you record music you just need                                 a dough so the dough is the program that                                 allows you                                 to record music to play music or play                                 live                                 and you can do many many things with it                                 also you can                                 run plugins in though you can use                                 virtual instruments to play                                 or virtual distract to record music so                                 that's why i'm talking about that and                                 this                                 is really important luckily enough we                                 have some choice today                                 linux today we have some non-free                                 those available on linux and                                 they are just proprietary they are not                                 free                                 for example we have renoise reaper                                 beadwig                                 and they're all available with native                                 linux support                                 but i use other personally because i                                 want to                                 make this project grow up and it's been                                 growing since                                          and i hope that i'm giving the good                                 example                                 to people teach them that they can use                                 linux                                 to produce music and they can also use                                 free tools                                 and freedom to produce actually                                 professional music                                 so talking about open source those we                                 have                                 many of them for example we have other                                 six that i mentioned                                 we have z rhythm lmms                                 and honestly there are many many others                                 that                                 i never tried also q tractor it must be                                 mentioned                                 because it's very popular the main point                                 of this tool today are plugins because                                 they are                                 really the pieces of the puzzle that you                                 need                                 to confuse music today because many                                 people are just using                                 virtual instruments instead of real                                 instruments for example i have this                                 keyboard here i can use some of the                                 sounds that i have                                 inside this keyboard but many many times                                 virtual instruments are just better and                                 they are free most of times                                 they are free in cost not free software                                 it's been easier to produce music                                 without going into recording studio                                 and recording your tracks actually                                 without having                                 real instruments and just using symbols                                 for example it could be very very                                 difficult to record an orchestra                                 if you don't have the room if you don't                                 have the record studio                                 if you don't have money so it's easier                                 to use                                 a virtual instrument that can play an                                 orchestra                                 so talking about plugin on linux we have                                 lv                                              formats we have also linux vst                                 but most common ones are lv                                            vst                                 so unfortunately not many commercial                                 plugins                                 support linux natively so we need to run                                 those plugins                                 through wire and through vst bridges                                 i'm using one of the best dst                                 bridges out there and this is called                                 yeah bridge                                 and was made by a cool guy i met already                                 called robert van der hell you can find                                 his projects on github and this is                                 really                                 doing a good work running windows                                 plugins                                 into linux with wine and we can still                                 improve that compatibility                                 but that should be used just as last                                 resort when                                 you don't have free tools good enough                                 to produce good music and you need for                                 example that                                 simple orchestra talking about the                                 comparison actually                                 that's pretty normal that free tools are                                 not good enough as commercial ones                                 because they have                                 big budgets they pay good musicians with                                 very expensive instruments they record                                 with very high quality                                 microphones that's not always the case                                 but most of the times                                 it is so for example speedfire audio                                 just does a very very cool plugin                                 called labs and they give you free psd                                 to using your compositions                                 and actually the quality is really                                 awesome so                                 i hope that we have that quality talking                                 about                                 first software for example i i                                 discovered vs                                 uh co orchestra recently and i think                                 many of                                 um those samples are really good you can                                 use them                                 using uh sfz format                                 so some phones if someone is familiar                                 with that                                 and they're great actually they can be                                 used with no problem at all                                 we have also free plugins to use                                 some phones but we don't have that level                                 of                                 complexity that comes with                                 more professional audio plugins so my                                 dream here                                 will be to see a very nice plugin that                                 allows me to play with simples actually                                 piano or orchestra because they're                                 important for musicians that computes                                 music for video games                                 or films actually and we're not                                 there yet we need more time to develop                                 more libraries and we need people                                 actually                                 so that's why linux need more people                                 that come                                 and discover linux as their main                                 production system                                 so as a side effect actually if we can                                 grab more people                                 and make them use linux actually telling                                 them that                                 linux is not difficult to use and you                                 can have all the vsts all the plugins                                 you want that you were using on windows                                 they could actually switch to linux and                                 they can contribute so we can create                                 more free tools                                 for everyone that's composing and                                 producing musical linux                                 actually i was really scared when i                                 switched from windows to linux because                                 many of plugins that i had were not                                 available on linux and i was forced                                 to use vsd bridges to play with them                                 they are important for me they are they                                 have a high quality and                                 going back to lower quality for me it                                 would not be great                                 i mean i just used two plugins                                 that runs on windows that i'm running                                 through vst bridge and linux                                 but i can't find something better in the                                 linux                                 system talking about free tools so for                                 now i'm using them i hope that in future                                 i can                                 replace them with free tools only                                 talking about free tools                                 i use many of them for example i use                                 hellos that is a good pipe organ                                 emulator                                 i have also helm that is a synthetizer                                 that                                 really can do many things and it's                                 very fast when you have to do some fast                                 patch and you don't want to lose time                                 it's very intuitive                                 and easy to use actually i'm using golf                                 plugins because                                 they're great you have everything from                                 eq through to compressors                                 to limiters stereotools we have                                 everything in golf plugin and that's                                 cool that                                 that is working great i like them i                                 think that is one of the most                                 complete suitable plugins available now                                 as a free tool we have deep fusion on                                 sub fx that                                 is a great scene and can be compared to                                 serum that's actually professional                                 closet source                                 software because you can do pretty                                 everything                                 everything there are also many cool                                 analog synthesizer emulators like aero                                 rack                                 and many others that i really find                                 interesting                                 also for people now coming to order                                 there are also plugins                                 available in order when you download                                 other six                                 the plugins that community made for                                 other                                 and they are just great they're simple                                 but they're they're they're working you                                 can find                                 many more free tools at this github                                 repository actually                                 there are many audio tools or those or                                 plugins that you can find and also vst                                 bridges                                 so if you need something that is the                                 right place                                 i've been working on game soundtracks                                 for                                 one year now and i'm working on many                                 open source games                                 for example super bombings that's a cool                                 platformer                                 and i'm composing the entire soundtrack                                 for game                                 there is pioneer space team i've just                                 done a couple of tracks                                 i've done some tracks for mine tests                                 hopefully some                                 mantas game can use them in their game                                 but                                 i actually sent one of my trucks that                                 was used                                 for a mine test server uh as the                                 halloween soundtrack                                 one week ago i also work on games that                                 are not                                 open source like yandere simulator i've                                 just done some tracks with                                 one friend of mine i am doing great                                 using linux i think that                                 now that i switch it to linux i don't                                 need windows anymore                                 i would like to better explain why                                 free tools are important and why linux                                 is important to people that are still                                 using                                 windows or macos to produce music                                 in conclusion i think that we have                                 people and we have                                 software to improve audio production                                 linux                                 nowadays more companies are going to                                 support linux                                 and they're going to bring their their                                 products on                                 linux with native support and that could                                 be beneficial to linux because                                 we can reach more people we can have                                 more people helping                                 that can test free tools and can                                 actually contribute to the making of                                 free tools i'm not saying that                                 we need proprietary tools at all but i                                 think that we need them                                 to reach more people on linux similar                                 thing is happening                                 in gaming and that is cool because                                 people are                                 just gaming on linux now that was                                 impossible some years ago                                 so better audio production means better                                 music                                 for open source and liver games and                                 ideal thing will be doing music relying                                 entirely on free tools                                 so let me know if you have some                                 questions in the qa                                 session that we will having right now                                 and thank you for watching                                 hello i hope you you liked                                 the talk and is there any question i see                                 how long takes you to create                                 wait music for a video game                                 approximately                                 so um it depends on the game actually                                 there are many games that are just                                 harder there are some music that are                                 just harder to compose                                 if you compare to others there are some                                 music that just have to be played in                                 background                                 you just need                                                           looked                                 some others are more complex because you                                 need to                                 create big songs being trucks with                                 an intersection and a liquid part so                                 yeah the answer is like one week                                 or two weeks or two or three days it                                 depends                                 usually you put all your effort in                                 composition and after that there is the                                 mix and master process                                 and this makes mixing a master phase                                 usually can take some days but you want                                 to                                 everything to be good so you have to                                 test music you have to play your music                                 on different devices on different                                 speakers because every speaker act                                 differently so there's                                 for example headphones and your phone                                 that that's just                                 different they have different                                 frequencies they they can give you a                                 different sensation when you're                                 different feeling when i hear the music                                 so you have to                                 reopen the project and see what's wrong                                 in master                                 so yeah usually one two weeks and                                 this mix and master section is not more                                 than two or three                                 days but the harder part is the                                 composition because you talk with the                                 developer you                                 you are trying to understand what he                                 wants what is the best for the game                                 what's it                                 what is the best thing what music fits                                 uh must                                 fix bad fits better in the game itself                                 because for example you create something                                 and it                                 it doesn't fit so you have to work again                                 and to                                 take a step back and to think about your                                 idea again                                 so this is the other part the the                                 hardest part is the                                 composition process                                 so this was the the question is there                                 any                                 other question for for me                                 uh this is sergio i don't see any other                                 questions right now we do have seven                                 folks in etherpad so feel free to add                                 your questions right now if you have any                                 uh we're also known uh irc so you can

                 please put question colon in all caps in                                 front of it                                 another cameo appearance                                 so i hope you you like the the the talk                                 i i wanted to put the effort on                                 what uh which tools we have                                 we we usually um                                 usually people tell me there's there's                                 no way i'm you're going to use linux to                                 produce music but                                 there are there are many many reason uh                                 because                                 one should use linux to produce music                                 to create music and the first reason is                                 that                                 nowadays it's possible we have many                                 tools professional tools and                                 compatibility tools like the one that                                 uh i speak about in the video the the                                 bridge                                 yeah bridge by robert                                 and so there are no excuses right now                                 that is great to hear yeah and it seems                                 like robert is in uh                                 in the rsc channel as well yeah                                 i don't see any other questions i would
