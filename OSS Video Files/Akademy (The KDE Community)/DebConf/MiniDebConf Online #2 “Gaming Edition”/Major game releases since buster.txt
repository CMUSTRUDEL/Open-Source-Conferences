	                              hi                               i'm emote                                                              debian and i'm sorry this talk doesn't                               have any nice slides or video clips                               of the games i'm about to recommend my                               motivation for this was triggered mainly                               by the release of supertux cart version                                                               which is a very well known game that has                                been in debian                                for a long time but this is a major                                release                                because it now supports networked                                multiplayer                                so rather than just split screen you can                                play with your friends online                                so i encourage you to revisit it and try                                it out                                we did actually have a sneaky one party                                during devconf a couple of days ago                                with about eight of us playing until we                                got tired after an                                hour and a half so it was good fun                                uh next is hedge wars which has also had                                its one point not release with a lot of                                polish                                particularly around the single player                                missions and they've also tried to                                make games more random                                mind test version                                                    content repository                                with a in-game browser which will make                                it much more accessible                                to new users without having to go                                downloading zip files from the forum                                websites etc                                i also took a look at various new                                packages in                                bullseye and notice some common themes                                so                                if you like text mode interpreters for                                story games then you're in luck                                there is a glu lxe                                d d-magnetic or q-tats                                i believe tads is an entire system                                around um                                making text adventures um                                i'm just going to list some others in                                case you recognize something you've been                                waiting for                                i suggest you check out their                                description for further details                                uh                                                                      name                                pekka kana                                         puzzle jigsaw and vonch                                some packages have returned to the                                archive after being missed out of buster                                such as g tetranet triple a                                and x evil if you have some time to                                spare there's                                sadly a few that have recently been                                removed from testing                                uh due to for example the python                                  removal                                or outstanding bugs with gcc                                    for example add an axis gpl edgar                                fceux or turntris                                and of course finally there's just                                plenty of games that have kept trucking                                along with some new releases                                or where a long period of inactivity has                                ended with new upstream development                                so if p y soft c had no releases                                between                                                and is now on a                                              uh warzone

    in the original                                um and again the development has picked                                up in p                                pace uh dream chess                                                                                                and and has just been updated to support                                widescreen monitors
