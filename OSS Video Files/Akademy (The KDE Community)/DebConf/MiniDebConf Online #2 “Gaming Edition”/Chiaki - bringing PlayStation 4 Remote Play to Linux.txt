Chiaki is an open source implementation of Sony's PlayStation 4 Remote Play, which is a game streaming protocol that allows the PlayStation 4 to be played remotely over the network. The talk will contain a brief overview of the protocol and the reverse engineering process that was used to obtain all of this information, as well as a few short demos of Chiaki in action.
It is intended for anyone interested in the technical details of low-latency game streaming or reverse engineering closed source applications.
