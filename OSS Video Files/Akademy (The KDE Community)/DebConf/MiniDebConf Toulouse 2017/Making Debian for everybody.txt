The Debian accessibility team aims at making Debian work nicely for people with disabilities. This of course means packaging accessibility-related software and bringing accessibility fixes in, but it also means integrating notions of accessibility into all stages of Debian, from d-i bootup to bug reporting. We will discuss past achievements and challenges ahead, which everybody can help with.
