The Talk will feature the state of Internet freedom in India and why the adaptation of Free and Open Source Software is a fundamental weapon in fighting for our digital rights. 
The talk will give a brief background on the reasons why FOSS is not widely used in India as it should be. It will proceed to discuss elementary steps for widespread use of FOSS in India.
Our audience will be students as well as primary users of FOSS who are just starting out their journey with FOSS tools. This talk will illuminate why FOSS is always the better alternative and its usefulness in fighting for Internet Freedom.

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,480
um um

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,760
there are some questions on the pad uh

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,800
jinka up until the jp so i'll just

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,920
uh tell you the question uh they're in

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
english

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,240
so let us know the answer for them um

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,480
yeah the first question is

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,360
does internet freedom foundation and

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,399
sflc

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,680
work together uh gne

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,640
internet freedom foundation issa and

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,040
sflc

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,040
you do

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,160
okay thank you um the next question here

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,920
what is the difference between sflc and

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,720
sflc india

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,680
so sflc is an organization based in new

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,079
york

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,079
and sflc india is a different

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
organization

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,839
okay um just an extension um

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
is

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,360
organizations are different uh their

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,720
constituents

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,880
is different okay thank you so

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,560
next question here government has to

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,320
accept force for things to work

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,639
right what can we as individuals do

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,639
right

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
foreign

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,360
so the next question is what happens

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,240
when there is competing priorities for

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,079
example

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,839
there is some really important issue at

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,880
hand and it becomes impossible to do it

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,360
without using

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,959
uh priority app right so how do you

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,959
handle such situations in your

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,839
but

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,959
i mean um this is like really nice

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,559
um but america is a good interesting

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,039
question out there next question is

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,959
is it ethical to use twitter twitter in

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,520
that context to twitter back and

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,880
back in is not false at all so many free

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,760
software organizations have twitter

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,439
accounts right

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,720
and lots of internet fights have

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,199
happened through social media like

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,520
twitter

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,480
facebook etc so what is your take on

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,880
that

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,640
uh there is something called necessary

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,880
evil which we

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,880
say

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,160
um that is great another follow-up

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,160
question we have is

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,840
any comments on the recent whatsapp

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,960
privacy issue

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,960
i think what if

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,120
imagine the number of people

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,919
it's not going to implement such a big

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,480
change but we also need to learn from

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,880
uh gdp like from from data protection

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,880
europe

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,640
now so thank you once again radical this

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,679
