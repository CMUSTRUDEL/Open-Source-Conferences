When packaging nodejs modules, often you face some complexities with the build process. I will try to cover some common cases like

1. Manually downloading a git commit snapshot when the repo does not have tags matching with npmjs.com releases
2. Exclude generated files from the source package (repacking)
3. Embed a simple dependency as a component (ignore, group and checksum options in watch file)
4. Simple case of circular self build dependency (babel-plugin-lodash build depends on itself)
5. Using extlinks and extcopies options of pkg-js-tools for creating node_modules directory with symlinks or copies of modules installed in /usr/share/nodejs

This workshop is going to be intermediate level. You should have some experience with creating debian packages.

You can learn the basics from https://wiki.debian.org/SimplePackagingTutorial
