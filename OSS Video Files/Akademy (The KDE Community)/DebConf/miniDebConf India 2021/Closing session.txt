00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,399
bring the diversity we have

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,039

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,799
uh we weren't expecting this this much

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:32,720
uh response for the call for proposal uh

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:36,720
to tell you the truth the real fact was

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,479
uh on we i believe the call for proposal

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,520
was ending on 10th and we had the

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,640
meeting on like

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,759
9th or 10th so we were expecting like 15

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
to 25 was

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,840
our number because at that time that was

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,799
the submission

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,920
but uh we had the meeting at about eight

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,320
or nine pm

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
and till the time we closed the

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,960
submission like

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,680
in the span of four five hours we

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,479
received another 25 to 26

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
submissions so we had about 50 plus of

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,320
which

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,399
we uh in the final ceremony we had

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,879
uh 28 talks buffs and workshops

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,879
and i would say

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,840
it was a very what do you say

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,520
we were always on the edge because i

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,920
would say uh

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,680
i had to upload a recording which was

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,959
going to go live in

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,440
like we had that at the 3 p.m slot and i

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,319
was

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
uploading that video at 6 minutes prior

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,239
to

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,319
like three like i was in the video team

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,599
i wasn't responsible for the late

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,640
submission so

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,800
like if you want to shoot someone uh

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,239
contact me i'll tell you who that said

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,000
person was

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,200
and uh the good part was uh we

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,879
uh all the 48 talks submissions and

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,599
all the 48 uh buffs workshops and talks

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,480
happened

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,280
so we didn't have any cancellation we

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,760
did have one

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,400
talk that was postponed but later in the

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,000
day that

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,360
talk happened and it went well and

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,720
on a personal level uh this was the

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,519
first time i had

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,040
presented a talk in a debian event or

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,760
they've been related event or i would

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,239
say

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,519
as well as my first words of feather or

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,120
discussion

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,920
and i am seeing multiple people

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,920
disconnecting from the gypsy call so

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,000
maybe that's the indication that i

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,519
should stop speaking

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,239
so i would request the talk director to

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,239
uh like switch to the tiling mode so

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,680
we can you people can see all the

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,680
organizers and

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,840
all the people associated with

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,000
this conference in some way or the other

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,080

like individually tell what part what

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,080

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,120
every team was like there was not like

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,159
if someone is in the publicity team he

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,920

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,239
all the other teams like everyone was

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,360
multitasking and there was no specific

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,799
role defined

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,840

at the same time

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,240

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,399
