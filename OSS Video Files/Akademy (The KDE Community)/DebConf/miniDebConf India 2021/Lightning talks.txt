00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,159
introduced myself and my new deviantart

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,159
since last video

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,760
and working for clear core

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,920
in this writing talk i recall devcon

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,680
presentation bless you and explain

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,119
some trouble some cases

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,840
and show you the solution

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,520
and the rest i'll share an experiment

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,520
about fibrodeviant.net

00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:43,520
technology i'll give a

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,920
short talk about

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:55,119
an experiment build fasteners front end

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:57,360
of black saving org

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,759
there are many services related to

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,560
debian

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:08,800
qa tracker or udd

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:14,080
these websites are granted for married

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:17,520
package mentor so the case is

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,520
not so easy cases

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,599
for example filing only untouchables or

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,040
blocked

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,040
perks at the grass

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,360
how to solve this situation i thought

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,840
about matching up existing

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,840
data and adding simple formatting

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,040
we can use email archives and udd

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,040
metadata

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:53,040
email archives are saved as a

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,040
bugs disk or a depth close

00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:05,840
we can access view ud metadata

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:05,840
via udd mirror

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,599
here is the concept of fiber

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,599
making unstable life comfortable

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,879
confortable state is we can fix a bag

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,000
or two iceberg or also

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,000
buy paid for bags

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,080
these three part is very important for

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,599
me

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,120
here's a simple system diagram

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,120
for deviant.

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,840
it's very a simple web application

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,760
as a result we can use

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,760
recently updated files like this

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,439
and also focus on textbooks

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,799
you can see the number of comments

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,799
from this screenshot images

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,479
also well we can focus on broadcast too

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,759
since step conf last year

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,280
i became a developer and i

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,440
got 500 intelligence of domain

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,840
and deployed a simple web service

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,840
experimental one

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,960
and now fabulous is possible for those

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,280
with this passive

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,240
we got several resources so

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,639
the shortage of several resources is

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,639
solved

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
now

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,000
the next thing will come

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,360
third there too to do

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,400
for fabridevan.net implementing

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,039
a call full text search feature and

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,039
personality

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
search

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
thank you for listening bye

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,320
go we have to thank kantaro hayashi

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,960
from japan for the talk

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,919
due to time zone issues kenturo may not

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,479
be available

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,080
online now but if you have questions you

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,520
can add on the pad or the india rc

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,120
channel the next talk is on gaming

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,800
in dbn by sirajana bocha

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,800
and it should be now

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,800
[Music]

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,800
hello

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,939
[Music]

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
is

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,479
is

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,840
games are the games which are officially

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,440
supported on linux

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,039
we just have to download it and hit it

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,479
to play it without any potential

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,080
troubleshooting

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,000
so i can give two examples here for you

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,840
the first one is steam steam is a very

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,919
popular digital video game store which

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,639
offers incredible deals on games for

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,520
linux

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,319
and the next one is portable linux games

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,000
where

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,440
this website offers a good collection of

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,160
linux games for 32-bit systems

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,960
so next one is windows games in linux

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
so there's a bunch of native linux games

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,919
out there

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,880
however most of the popular games

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,919
available

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,680
might not be available on linux directly

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,080
in other words the latest and greatest

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,919
games do not support linux all the time

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,840
so in that case with the help of tools

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,360
like wine

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,319
uh lutress crossover game hub we can

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,440
easily play

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,560
a huge number of popular windows games

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,680
on linux

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,720
here i could give examples for you steam

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,960
play

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,800
if you're fond of using sim as your only

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,680
source of games on linux you can easily

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,400
try

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,240
windows only games using steam play wine

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,280
wine is a compatibility

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,080
layer that is capable of running windows

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:13,680
applications and systems like linux bsc

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:16,879
osx so

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,280
the next uh are browser games so

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,160
browser games are uh you know needless

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,160
to say there

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
uh that there are tons of browser based

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
games that are available to play

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,360
in any operating system be it windows or

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,599
linux

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,520
so most of the addictive mobile games

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,880
such as good game empire

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,200
also have their web browser counterparts

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,919
so these games are pretty much popular

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,320
for us

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,039
and we play a lot of browser games all

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,080
the time

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,160
so terminal games the added advantage of

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,000
advantage of linux is that you can use a

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,640
command line terminal to play games as

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,480
well

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,720
i know that it's not the best way to

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,120
play games but at times but it's awesome

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,399
and fun to play games like snake

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,519
2048 in the terminal

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,640
so these are the games

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,560
which are popular with terminal

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,920
yeah so the next comes debian distros

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:16,880
so so uh

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,880
distros are uh if you're hardcore pc

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,560
gamer

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,560
going live in now so

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,320
uh i want to play a lot of games

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,560
on my computer but i don't get a lot of

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,519
time maybe from now i'll start playing a

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,200
lot of games

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,160
so uh next we have uh having fun with

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,440
the terminal

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,120

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,320
tool for improving our developers

just i'm zooming in that and i'm showing

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,959
like just hit the sl

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,079
and there we can see how

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,519
it works a train coming from right side

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,800
of your screen and ending on to your

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,720
left side of the screen

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,079
and when it ends the command closes

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,920
automatically

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,600
that's how excel works this is one of

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,800
the

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,000
cool stuff we have in the store and

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,560
however a cow saying whatever we give

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,800
input to that in a ascii format let's

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,800
see

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,000
if we type cause a and give some

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,560
input you can get the uh whatever we

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,760
have given

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:57,839
input in the terminal and

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,839
you can see that i can show you

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,079
you can have see cause and high

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,079
likes

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,800
yes we can see right in ascii format

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,480
like

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,360
a picture of cow and saying hi linux

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,680
yes that's how it works and what about

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,240
like

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,279
knowing fortune how about terminal

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,160
giving

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,880
us a fortune yes we often feel some kind

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,120
of a posture note right whenever we

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,560
heard about fortune and it's a

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,600
completely random stuff

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,399
and if we go to terminal and install the

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,120
given common screen and type the fortune

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,279
we can now

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,639
some kind of random stuff it is name in

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,600
public opinion click

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,320
and even it is random it gives random

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
every time

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,160
for uh every time you hit the fortune it

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,160
gives some random fortune

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:55,920
and that's how you can see on the screen

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,920
and well coming to the next thing

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,839
like how we combine what about we

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,480
combining the both

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,079
cause and fortune however causes saying

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,639
our fortune

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,639
we can see that by clicking on like

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,800
fortune pipe cause using pipe symbol

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,399
and we can see cow is saying like our

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,760
fortune you have the body of a 19 year

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,800
old please return it

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,000
before it gets bring brinking that's

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,600
kind of some funny stuff right really

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,079
and yeah the next thing is store it

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,880
yes i'm not kidding and yes it's really

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,279
funny

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,800
and definitely not but for sure this

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,920
comment name itself is too funny and

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,360
definitely

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,680
i don't know who created it uh

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,880
it uses to make beautiful ascii pictures

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,120
whatever you

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,320
we give input to the terminal and you

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,000
can see how it works

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,760
just toilet and give

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,560
the command whatever you want to give

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,760
i'm giving toilet

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,360
deb conf yes we can see right some

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:07,040
ascii picture and it also has it also

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,000
some color uh color effect

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,600
i mean color we can have the same text

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,560
in the color in different color manners

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,279
also

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
color formats you can see that by typing

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,199
toilet f

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,440
minus f mono two l minus f metal

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,800
and hit the text whatever you trying to

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
give input to that

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,480
and you can see the same text but in

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
different color

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,639
and different with a different effect

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,639
yes that's how it works

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,800
and coming to the next part uh

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,040
having a fire with a smoke in our

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,600
terminal yes you're listening right

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,040
just hit the a fire and you can see a

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,040
smoke coming in our terminal

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,760
that's kind of free scary stuff

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,279
yeah i can imagine

00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:02,240
and next thing is like how about like

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:05,360
having a jerry uh

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,920
trying to catch a mouse yes the logic is

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,839
same

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,160
but here you can see the funny stuff and

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,199
here we can see oniko

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,680
it uh it shows you like

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,639
we can see by dragging your mouse and

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,760
jerry is trying to catch it right

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,880
this is a really funny thing and when we

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,199
try to stop and when it catches

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:33,040
and yeah it knots it it is celebrating

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:36,480
yeah that's how it works and the next

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,320
not only funny stuff but we have like

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,880
many games many childhood games we have

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,480
spent like in our childhood playing

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,279
and even we have some tunnel games in

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,920
linux where we can play and we can

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,759
we can have some really cool stuff and

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,440
kind of relaxation it gets relaxed in

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,880
our day-to-day life

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,399
and who doesn't know tetris the famous

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,360

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,639
times

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,120
so to install that just

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,800
make sure you have the basset command

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,880
which is the tetris of linux

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,279
and we have like arrow-based controls

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,240
and this is how it works this is all we

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,160

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,559
my experience of debian buster

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,600
release party it was on

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,640
6th july 2019 at

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,919
hyderabad where i was

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,280
very much excited as it was my first

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,840
release party there were around

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,840
100 to 150 participants for the

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,880
celebration

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,760
me along with my friends have attended

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,000
the party

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,039
and got to know many other debian

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,240
distributions

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,039
and free software tools

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,760
it was the biggest successful release

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,760
parties

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:07,280
in the world this was the schedule

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,480
of the release party we had a talk

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,760
on role of debian in enabling

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,880
software freedom which was by me

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,160
where debian being a universal

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,039
operating system always stood as a

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,679
strong

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,360
free software alternative against

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,520
proprietary softwares

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,760
respecting users freedom and privacy

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,960
of course we have lot of debian

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,640
distributions

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,679
like freedom box kali linux pareto s

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,559
fedora and lot more and their short

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,720
stories

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:47,280
were showcased by my co-activist

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,480
we taught usage of debian to the

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,520
students of

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,880
schools colleges faculties

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,799
employees and more where they have

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,919
expressed their debian experience

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:06,159
i came across lot of new ideas

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:09,200
from the people in the release party

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,559
of them were new to debian but

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,280
later we had debian buster installation

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,799
fest

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,919
with newbies they have switched

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,240
their operating system to debian wiping

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,760
up

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,600
the proprietary softwares we have

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,720
celebrated the release party with cake

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:35,840
learned lot of new things and also

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,840
had lot of fun

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,840
these were the few movements from the

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,840
release party

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,400
