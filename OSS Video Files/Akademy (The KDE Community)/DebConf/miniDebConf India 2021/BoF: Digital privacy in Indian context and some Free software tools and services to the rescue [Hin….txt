In this BoF we will investigate the attitude of common people towards digital privacy in India. What are these business models that encourage privacy invasion software and services. We'll discuss how network effect keeps people dependent on these services.

How free software allows freedom to take back control over data in a private manner. How this can be mitigated with the help of Free software and services. We'll also touch upon what sorts of law will provide us real privacy.
