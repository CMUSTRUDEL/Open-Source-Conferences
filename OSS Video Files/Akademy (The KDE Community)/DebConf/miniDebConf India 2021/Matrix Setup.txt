Would like to go through a simple basic matrix setup.

I will explain briefly what a federation is and what the matrix protocol is. After that I will go through installing ansible on debian and setting up this playbook - https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy to run a matrix server.

I think anyone would benefit from taking a look at the matrix.org project, it's nice to have your own chat server.
