FOSSology is a collaboration project of the Linux Foundation covering license compliance tasks: It is a Web server system for users and a toolkit. As a toolkit you can run license, copyright and export control scans from the command line. As a system, a database and Web user interface provides you with a compliance workflow.

This session explains how we can bring the goodness of license/copyright scanning using fossology agents directly into gitlab in an automated way through a small demo project on Salsa.
