hi everybody

00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:12,380
do you hear me okay I'm glad to

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:15,240
introduce Daniel Pocock with the speak

00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:22,580
free real-time communications with free

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:26,580
software okay who can give me the name

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:37,200
of a free communication service on the

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:40,379
Internet jitsi yes sorry okay if you

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,629
went out on the street and asked one of

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,489
the students who's walking by to give

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:49,610
you an example of the free communication

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:58,550
service what would they tell you Skype

00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:58,550
anything else yep Google Hangouts okay

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:12,930
okay are they really free how can a

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,619
business like Skype be viable if all the

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,400
phone calls are free you know a business

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:24,330
needs to sell some product to make money

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:33,000
so in these free cloud services where is

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:39,420
the product can anybody take a guess the

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,600
the user is the product yep you are the

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,470
product in the free cloud services like

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,500
Skype or Google Hangouts and you want to

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,820
communicate with your friends your

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:57,360
family maybe your work colleagues the

00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,810
cloud providers people like Skype and

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,270
other companies like Facebook they want

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,810
something in exchange for that they want

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,959
to know who you know they want to know

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,020
what is important to you yeah who is

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,010
your favorite football team or what you

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,290
do on your holiday

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:22,170
and how do you spend your time what are

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:26,459
you thinking about right now or how are

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:30,480
you feeling right now is this valuable

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:33,840
information for a company is this

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,470
information they can sell it's a good

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,069
product

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:43,349
okay is this type of information

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:45,659
revealed in your communications if a

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,760
company is giving you a free phone

00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,890
service where they can monitor your

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,129
phone calls and they can monitor your

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:57,239
voice can they detect how you're feeling

00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,680
when you speak yes certainly you can go

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:04,349
and look online and you can find

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:08,250
algorithms for doing this so many people

00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:11,310
are now using these services completely

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:15,150
blind to the amount of information that

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:21,169
they're giving away is there any hope

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:25,139
that we can bring them a solution which

00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:31,230
software producer has a social contract

00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:33,780
that gives people freedom who has 22

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:39,989
years of experience of building a

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:47,430
platform that is genuinely free yeah

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:50,790
Debian a good solution okay Debian had

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:54,690
answers to these problems before the

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:58,319
cloud even got moving before Facebook

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,389
and these other phenomenons Debian

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,370
developers had the answers and were

00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:05,000
writing them down in our social contract

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,220
and Debian free software guidelines

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,669
these give us principles to build

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,980
software that doesn't give away all our

00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,440
information and our privacy and our

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,269
feelings and things that people want to

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:24,539
market and sell for their benefit and

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:27,180
now Debian is the product so when you

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,410
install Debian and use it for your

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,820
communique

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:38,160
you stop being part of the product

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:40,710
doesn't that feel better yes so Debian

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,139
has a lot Debian has web browsers we

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,930
have email software we have office

00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,199
productivity software we have specialist

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,750
software for science and engineering

00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,639
business and accounting and we have

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,539
tools for creative people you know

00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:00,870
software developers like myself

00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:04,169
designers video editing Debian has lots

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:09,120
of things but free real-time

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:10,889
communications has remained elusive like

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
most Linux distributions

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:17,550
there's no seamless solution you can't

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,860
just install Debian and type in the SIP

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,849
address of a friend and call them in

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:27,479
five minutes and over the last three

00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:29,400
years the server-side software which

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,010
people can run if they have their own

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,330
server has become a lot more stable than

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,780
it was in the past

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:40,229
we now have things like turn relays in

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:43,020
Debian that can relay voice and video

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:46,260
streams for people who are behind net

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,270
firewalls so if people start installing

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,690
these things to their debian servers

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:54,000
then that becomes a stepping stone to

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,389
building a free real-time communications

00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,470
network on the other hand the client

00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:03,659
software that's installed on the desktop

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:07,110
it's not quite there yet not all of the

00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:09,419
soft phones in Debian are able to use

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,150
all of those servers right now and

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,190
they're catching up they all have slight

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,870
differences so they sometimes have

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,930
trouble communicating with each other

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,570
even when you're on the same network so

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,699
usually if you want to use one of the

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,320
soft phones in Linux in any Linux

00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,419
distribution if you're on the same

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,389
network and the other person is using

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,130
the same soft phone then the call will

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,370
get through but if you're on different

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:38,070
networks then they start to struggle but

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,950
that that's like the final frontier that

00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,400
we have to to cross to solve this

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,400
problem

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:51,300
for the Debian community and Debian

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:55,560
developers we've had the RTC Debian org

00:06:51,300 --> 00:07:00,240
service since January 2014 is launched

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:03,270
at many debconf in Paris all developers

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,420
can use their account and their Debian

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,690
email address as a sip address to test

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:12,330
any of the soft phones in Debian to test

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:16,350
soft phones that that you might want to

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:21,060
start packaging and to test things like

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:22,500
mobile apps for sip and on top of that

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,740
we have web RTC

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,850
which I'll get to in a moment and so

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:33,120
this platform has been very very stable

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:36,840
and it's running 24 by 7 for people to

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,360
connect to with any of these sips or

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:44,730
phones to see if they work and to call

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,190
other people many of the problems that

00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,190
people have are well understood for

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,960
example we know that it's it's difficult

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,060
for people to set up some of these

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,480
phones because they have to set 20

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,670
different preferences in some of them so

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,550
we need to solve that by providing

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:05,700
better provisioning we know they have

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,680
trouble getting through firewalls so we

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,380
have a solution for that is for them to

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,550
start using these turn servers to relay

00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:17,940
the media streams the Debian bug

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,490
tracking system shares details of these

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,680
things publicly Debian is all about

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:26,190
transparency and this makes it easy to

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:30,720
see where we are at in addressing this

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:34,110
problem so we believe this strategy

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,150
provides the best approach to solve the

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:40,770
problems of free communications in an

00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:42,720
open manner and so what does work I've

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,450
mentioned that some of the soft phones

00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,290
do have problems today but it's not all

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,020
bad news

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,120
there are two things that work quite

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,780
well and very quickly using free

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,750
software and one option is the

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,950
smartphone app

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,070
there are a number of these apps

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:04,960
available in market places like f-droid

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:07,120
or in google play and these will install

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,880
onto your phone very quickly and let you

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,790
start making circles or other protocols

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,650
and the other option is web RTC that

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:19,270
it's quite quick to get this up and

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:22,480
running as well and both of these types

00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:24,280
of softphone are backed by debian

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
infrastructure as I mentioned the

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,810
packages that we use on the servers and

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,330
they've all been quite stable for a

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,580
number of years now and you can install

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,820
them with apt-get do a little bit of

00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,950
configuration and when you have a server

00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:43,180
that can support both the smartphone

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:47,920
apps and the web RTC users and iso-ne

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:49,930
smartphones and who has Android but many

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,310
people have Android ok it's based on

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:56,950
Linux so it's not a bad choice and

00:09:53,310 --> 00:10:00,280
smartphone apps have a particular

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:04,089
advantage they run in a device that

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,460
looks like a phone it's feels like a

00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:09,790
phone because it is a phone so if

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:13,300
someone deploys a soft phone to run in

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:16,839
this type of Linux then it's quite

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,450
natural for somebody to use it it has

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,910
the other advantages like access to a

00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:24,430
contact list that most people have in

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,650
their Android phone and so this makes

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:32,440
the smartphone apps a good way to

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:35,830
develop free communications networks has

00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:42,280
anyone tried luma call sea sip simple

00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:44,950
Lin phone any of these other apps yep so

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,420
if you haven't or if you if it's a long

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,720
time ago and you're not using them

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,790
regularly then try them out jump on the

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,850
mailing lists and I'll get to those

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:57,370
later give us some feedback and if

00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,290
you're really keen your contributions on

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:04,330
github always welcome we're almost

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:08,820
looking at ways to improve the other

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,820
option that works well is WebRTC

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:17,580
who does not have a web browser okay and

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:21,150
who doesn't regularly update to the

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,820
latest web browser okay there's a couple

00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,890
of people so there are hundreds of

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,680
millions of people out there with web

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:31,560
browsers that are updating them

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,290
automatically and every time they get an

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,240
update they're getting the latest

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:40,320
libraries for web RTC as part of that

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:43,140
browser that's 99% of their phone is in

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,050
the browser itself and that's always up

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,600
to date and it's very advanced it has

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:53,070
features for encryption for NAT

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,440
traversal to get through firewalls it

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,930
has the compression for different types

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,810
of network environments it has voice and

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,720
video support and hundreds of me

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:06,840
millions of people have these browsers

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,300
and it can be activated just by getting

00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,370
them to go to a webpage they click a

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,670
link in an email or they click a link

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,500
from one website to go to a phone it

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,410
downloads a bit of JavaScript and now

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,770
they're using a phone and that can go

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,350
back to a open source solution running

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:30,990
on sip or it can root their call into a

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:35,070
proprietary solution so for Debian

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:39,000
developers you can log in at RTC Debian

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:40,740
org and start receiving calls from other

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,520
people from other developers who have

00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:48,180
been account and from anonymous callers

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,240
who use free phone box net and you can

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,000
even give people a link using free phone

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,730
box net that they can click to call your

00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,380
Debian org account and if you're not

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,380
happy with the appearance of the service

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:13,080
it's just JavaScript and HTML you can

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,460
clone this website and edit it to look

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,550
however you want you can change the

00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,810
color you can change the instructions

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,840
and it will still work

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,680
there's no PHP or anything else on the

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,810
server side

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,230
that you need in order to modify this

00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,230
site

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:49,030
okay so the next topic is Federation so

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:52,660
we have this wonderful site at RTC

00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:54,880
Debian org but what's the use of it if

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,220
you can only call other Debian

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,100
developers what if you want to call a

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,620
fedora developer or someone who's not a

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,380
developer at all and this is where a

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:08,400
federation comes in and they're calling

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:12,160
from one domain to another who

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,590
administers a linux server in an office

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,190
or another organization we have system

00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:21,700
administrators here and how many of you

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:24,840
actually run a sip or XMPP service in

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:28,960
your organization so quite a few of you

00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:33,850
and you use that for Federation or just

00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,130
internally just internally so who's

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:41,500
actually tried federating with other

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:43,180
people so just a few people okay so and

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,280
this is what we already do with email

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:48,280
that you can send email from one domain

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,860
to any other domain that's Federation

00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,320
and it's it's very important because the

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:57,700
more people you can reach the more

00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,920
pervasive the technology becomes if you

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,350
want to start setting up a federated

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:11,530
Network then a really good resource is

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:17,560
the RTC Quick Start Guide so that's here

00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:24,100
it's available online it has a an

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:27,130
explanation of the architecture and it

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:36,550
goes through step-by-step instructions

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:41,460
for things like setting up your DNS your

00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:44,410
firewall and then all the individual

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,480
package installations and everything on

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,890
all the standard Linux distributions

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:54,090
including Debian Ubuntu Fedora Red Hat

00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,090
CentOS and so on

00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,980
so what we'll do is we'll make a quick

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,980
demo

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:40,330
so this is RTC Debian org I'm gonna log

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:45,420
in now I'm registered so Hector's gonna

00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:45,420
try and call me from free phone box.net

00:16:51,930 --> 00:17:01,089
okay so we can see a anonymous user is

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:05,579
calling we answer with video with this

00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:08,620
button the browser asks for permission

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:12,429
for the JavaScript to have access to the

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:15,339
microphone and webcam that's a security

00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:18,790
precaution to stop websites monitoring

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:22,209
you when you visit the site and there we

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:24,309
go we've now got you've got Firefox on

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,050
your phone yeah

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:30,100
so the so Hector has actually called

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:34,120
from Firefox on a mobile device running

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,590
Android and we just got that up and

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,370
running now did you have to do any

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,140
configuration you just use the URL from

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,890
my email yeah

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:48,450
so that's that's how easy it can be it's

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:51,610
all running on debian infrastructure

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:59,919
except for the phone obviously which is

00:17:51,610 --> 00:18:02,890
running Android we just have a look at

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,590
the user interface this is built with

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,510
Jas communicator so if you want to

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,300
customize something like this more

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:13,360
heavily you can either take an existing

00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:16,000
site like this and just copy it and

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:20,050
start modifying it or you can go and get

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,530
Jas communicator from github and start a

00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:29,919
fresh project for your own web RTC

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:34,450
website who uses Drupal CMS we have any

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:37,030
Drupal users there's a module called

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,520
drew call that you can install in Drupal

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,269
that will give you jes communicator

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,839
without

00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:46,059
any development or coding or anything

00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:48,969
you just install the Drupal module and

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:53,879
then you have a web RTC facility in your

00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:57,099
Drupal website do we have anyone

00:18:53,879 --> 00:19:01,359
remotely who would like to participate

00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:04,320
is anyone on IRC who's watching us over

00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,320
the streaming service

00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:22,540
there's no answer on IRC okay we just

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,630
wait a moment just to see if anybody on

00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:29,160
IRC answers there's a slight delay in

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,160
the video streaming

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:57,179
should we give them any more time or we

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:57,179
move on okay we continue thanks Hector

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:18,639
okay so what if we do nothing what if we

00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:21,970
just leave the soft phones that we have

00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:24,580
in Debian the way they are and continue

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:28,870
using other solutions for communication

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:32,620
without trying to bring in the solutions

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:34,990
that are genuinely free well first of

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,019
all the social networks and cloud

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,909
providers are also looking very

00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:42,510
enthusiastically at WebRTC is an

00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:45,100
opportunity to take market share from

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:48,250
companies like Skype and Google Hangouts

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,649
and how would you feel if one of your

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,769
friends tells you that if you want to

00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:55,690
call them you have to use Facebook or

00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:58,679
that you have to install a Facebook app

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,539
on your phone and who would not want to

00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:07,179
rely on that as a way to call their

00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:09,880
friends and family yeah okay LinkedIn

00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:11,860
and Salesforce are likely to try and

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:17,350
offer similar services to business

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:20,169
communities if you look at bringing

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:23,110
Linux to your friends and family in

00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:26,610
their homes on their desktop computer or

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:30,190
their laptop what are the issues that

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,870
that change their mind or that make them

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,889
go back to what they were using before

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:38,950
Linux is peer pressure at the top of

00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:41,100
that list perhaps and where will you

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,720
find more peer pressure than

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,639
communication software there's somebody

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,750
they want to speak to or communicate

00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:51,760
with and the free software solutions

00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,919
don't work for them and their friends

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,260
tell them I'll just install Windows

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,970
again or something like that so you

00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,679
might have spent a bit of time helping

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:03,850
that person learn about free software

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,039
and and you've had a small regression

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:10,389
and then they're back to using something

00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:13,299
else and how much harder will it be to

00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:17,379
promote Linux if companies start using

00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:19,960
corporate solutions like Microsoft Lync

00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:21,940
and because what happens when a company

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,820
puts in one of those solutions

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,460
as they start developing other internal

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,129
applications around it and they become

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,019
very dependent on that and it'll be very

00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:37,769
hard for them to move off those things

00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:42,039
and at the same time they have a

00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:43,870
Microsoft is constantly undermining open

00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:47,049
standards by making their own little

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:49,179
deviations from the standard so if they

00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:52,450
have enough market share in one domain

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:54,820
and then they can break compatibility

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:57,129
with other products I mean we saw this

00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,139
with Skype that worked with asterisk for

00:22:57,129 --> 00:23:02,320
a while and then they took away the

00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:05,110
asterisk support so when you when you

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,600
rely on on one of these corporate

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:10,360
solutions you're always at their mercy

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,240
and at any time they can change the

00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,299
standards or move people on to other

00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:20,830
products and this is never good for free

00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:23,889
software and open standards for Debian

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:26,080
developers I mean many people regard us

00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:28,809
as leaders in in the free software

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,590
community there we have tough standards

00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:34,720
on what we accept in Debian we have very

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,720
high standards for how we run our own

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,990
services using free software that we

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:44,500
don't rely on on cloud services as part

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:48,190
of the process of building Debian but if

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,320
people see us using other solutions for

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,429
communications solutions that are not

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,039
free does that undermine our leadership

00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:59,559
yeah it can be very very dangerous to do

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:03,519
that and so this is something that we

00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:05,679
have to be very rigorous about and so

00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:08,830
what are the next steps that people can

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,809
take try the things that we've discussed

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:14,789
in this talk if you're a Debian

00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:17,529
developer try that RTC Debian dog and

00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:20,350
come to the session on Monday afternoon

00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:22,899
where we can do some hands-on stuff if

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,820
anybody has a server they would like to

00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:26,710
try and configure or where they got

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,929
halfway through setting this up and they

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,820
stopped and they have some problem we

00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:32,619
can look at that together and try and

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,630
get it working we can look at

00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:38,419
troubleshooting techniques

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:41,210
subscribe to the free RTC mailing list

00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:46,100
this has been generously sponsored by

00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:48,620
the FSF in Europe and the final thing is

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:52,100
to look out for a new crowdfunding

00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:54,070
campaign so there's going to be some

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,809
details about this in the near future

00:24:54,070 --> 00:25:00,500
looking at how we can raise some money

00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:04,610
to improve some of the soft phones and

00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:10,190
other products that we already have does

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:26,260
anybody have any questions so here's the

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:26,260
microphones does this work I agree that

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,809
one-to-one communications is already in

00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,809
bad shape but we also do need some to

00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:40,990
have something for a larger groups

00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:43,600
actually I think so conferencing

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:47,120
solutions for larger groups of people

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:51,970
yeah there are a couple of options for

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:54,230
this jitsi meet and it's a web RTC

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:59,419
conferencing is this the sort of thing

00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:03,650
you're asking about let's bring back the

00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:07,400
microphone yeah have you have you tried

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:09,320
jitsi mate yes I have but it's already

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,210
works not very well in a one-to-one

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,590
situation I don't know how it would work

00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:19,610
or keep up in a largest conferencing

00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:22,190
situation yes okay so that's one option

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:24,650
it does work differently for different

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:28,100
people it depends on your bandwidth as

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:30,830
well and another solution if you're just

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,169
using voice and you don't need video

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:37,400
there's a solution called recon server

00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:41,090
in Debian and asterisk also supports

00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:46,250
some voice conferencing any other

00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:48,380
questions I wanted to thank you Daniel

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,309
for the work that you've done on RTC

00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,809
stuff you've been

00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:52,309
pushing on this for several years now

00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,289
and it's much appreciated I think we

00:26:52,309 --> 00:27:04,190
need more people doing it so I wanted to

00:26:54,289 --> 00:27:05,899
say thank you first off and you you had

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,669
mentioned that soft phones the soft ones

00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:10,309
that we have on the mix desktop struggle

00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:13,159
on the larger internet but they tend to

00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:14,899
work ok on local networks and I wonder

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,789
if you can characterize what's what's

00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,679
the cause of that struck like is it our

00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:20,960
there is it packet blockage is it

00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,970
networks not passing traffic as expected

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,409
what do we know why that's happening are

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:28,309
the things we could fix in the network

00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:31,940
to make those more accessible and yes we

00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:33,379
do know why it's happening a lot of it

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:38,659
is to do with getting through firewalls

00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:40,309
and the web RTC helps with that and I'd

00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:42,259
like to go into more details but we've

00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:44,720
run out of time now the next speaker

00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:48,580
needs to take over so let's go into that

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,580
