hello everybody hello everybody good

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,370
afternoon welcome to the first lightning

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,139
talk session of DEFCON 15 we've got six

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,719
frightfully exciting speakers for you

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,039
today starting with Gareth Randle

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,020
talking about triplets which is

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,150
encrypted backups with no keys or

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:27,300
passwords thank you very much good

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:32,070
afternoon this is talk about a project

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,899
that I've created called triptychs which

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,170
is to deal with a problem that we have

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,660
with off-site backups and that's the

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,300
sort of backup if your computer's stolen

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,090
or your house burns down and basically

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,500
you've lost everything except the backup

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:52,610
now typically people do that by writing

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,520
their data onto one storage device

00:00:52,610 --> 00:01:00,390
taking it to a distant location and

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,920
hiding it and but there's a problem now

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,799
it looks like the graphics not coming

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,280
out here I'm just going to see if

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,280
they've got it

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,549
right the problem with sending that of

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,250
course an off-site backup is how you're

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:33,030
going to encrypt it now you could

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,740
encrypt it with a private key but then

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,560
of course there's the issue of well how

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,119
do you actually keep the private key

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,430
safe as if private key may be the thing

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,009
you're actually trying to restore you

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,509
could encrypt with a password but you

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,270
might forget it now you might say oh

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,040
well hey that's not very likely but

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,659
consider the example in the financial

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,899
services industry where you have to

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,960
store data for seven years or maybe more

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,340
you could have say the police come to

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,469
your organization and say we're trying

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,740
to investigate a financial fraud can you

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,119
restore data from years ago and it turns

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,640
out the people who created that backup

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,660
left the company so you don't actually

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,870
know where the actual keys are and okay

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,799
let's look at this project

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,739
is a simple simplified solution we have

00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:24,340
some plain text here which can be any

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:26,920
size and we have a random byte stream

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,540
which is the same length and we're

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,250
basically just the exclusive-or in that

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:36,970
together and storing this and the random

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:40,629
data on two separate volumes so you're

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,810
now to to decrypt that of course you

00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:44,769
take the you bring the two together

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,379
exclusive or them again you get back

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:49,989
your original data so the secrets on our

00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:53,799
encrypting wizz is effectively the

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:59,560
location of these two hidden storage

00:02:53,799 --> 00:03:03,129
volumes so there is a problem though if

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,180
you lose one or if one becomes damaged

00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:09,250
without your knowledge the other one

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,459
silently becomes useless as well can we

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:18,190
solve that and fortunately we can we can

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:19,599
write three volumes each with a two of

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,000
which can be brought together to restore

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,709
the data but any one of which on its own

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,519
is useless to an attacker so how does

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,730
this work

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,650
right our three volumes here I've used

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,750
the floppy disk logo which is almost a

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,870
bit like security by obscurity but these

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,370
could be anything these could be USB

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,620
memory sticks these could even be tapes

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:46,060
and they're actually written in stripes

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,519
like raids and you can see here that

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,709
whenever you exclusive or something

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,540
again you get back the original data so

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:57,699
you can exclusive or d1x or I with a to

00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,699
get back D 1 you can exclusive or those

00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:02,799
two to get back D to concatenate them

00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:05,400
and you've got your data I'll leave it

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,889
as an exercise to work out how you get

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,790
the data from the third one and any of

00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:17,289
the other two so we have the there's a

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:19,359
cost it costs three bytes of storage for

00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:22,210
every byte of plaintext the great

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,250
advantage is that you are now encrypting

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,970
with a one-time pad

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:31,330
thank you very much now if and of course

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:34,120
only if your random sources are truly

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,180
random then any possible decrypt is

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:41,350
equally likely so dare I say it's

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:44,020
effectively unbreakable so let's look at

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,780
the actual project it's written in Java

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,660
there you you've basically doing your

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,150
your tar piping to standard in writing

00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,790
to your three volumes which you've

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:58,060
plugged in when you want to restore you

00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:01,690
run the program and you've you pick any

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,000
to heavily unit tested because the

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,590
outputs obviously looked very random you

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,260
can't tell them by eye whether they

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:12,070
right or wrong I would hope that this

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,960
becomes more mainstream and I'm very

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,910
thankful to Def Con for giving me the

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:24,760
chance to make that happen and thank you

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:28,030
for listening perfectly timed with four

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,520
seconds to go next up is tomash bahut

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:43,150
talking about implementing debian with

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:45,370
etherium ready I don't know okay okay so

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,160
I want to I want to share my excitement

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:53,290
with something that I recently tried

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:55,510
anybody tried etherium yourself okay one

00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,270
guy so it's cool

00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:01,060
probably you finger also it's cool okay

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,330
so we want to share our excitement with

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,510
it

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,370
so at realm is a bit like a a bit like

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:10,930
Bitcoin you everybody knows about

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,250
Bitcoin but it's like a dream is like

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,450
Turing machine

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:20,800
well Turing complete machine compared to

00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:23,110
abacus right because with at the ROM you

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,440
can't you you can do much more you can

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,330
execute this in a distributed manner

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,800
arbitrary programs okay it's actually

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,280
quite difficult to understand what it

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,100
means and so on but I will try to

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,169
introduce it very fast so some basic

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,169
facts the facts it was in

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:43,599
shall I describe three years ago and

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:45,219
there were many iterations already they

00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:46,870
are improving the protocol and so on and

00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:50,680
so on

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:53,860
frontier is the recent release two weeks

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,349
ago which they made which people could

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,370
start mine the blocks necessary for

00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:03,240
computations on a tree on blockchain and

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:06,039
in some sense it started really working

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,889
so instead of bitcoins you have utter

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,330
there's there's the same principle the

00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:13,150
hash functions are a bit different and

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,830
so on and so on and there was an initial

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:18,310
presale from Bitcoin which I didn't

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:23,849
participate in I mined some blocks using

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:25,960
Amazon GPUs just for fun and so

00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:27,789
internally what's happening there is a

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,400
bytecode that is run on a virtual

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:33,539
machine that it's basically distributed

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,830
everywhere in some sense like Bitcoin

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:37,620
but it's turing-complete that's very

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,050
important you can do whatever you want

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,479
so we can do arithmetic strings and so

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,099
on and there is a light javascript

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,050
language that you can use to compile

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,969
your programs and then you have to

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:53,469
publish them on the blockchain so that

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:55,899
people can use them and I think the year

00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:58,300
they are using LLVM right now to do that

00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:02,889
so programs in a tram are usually cut

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:05,830
contracts and you have to pay think

00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:08,879
about Bitcoin again to execute your

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:14,710
programs or actually to publish them

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:16,990
it's not very much okay and contracts

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,870
can access and modify the state on the

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,879
blockchain so think about it as a big

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,539
database and you have programs that are

00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:29,889
executed independently of even the

00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:32,289
authors and modify the state the

00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,800
programs cannot be changed when when

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:40,479
they are deployed in some sense they are

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:42,219
virtually distributed so pretty cool

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,709
stuff this is the implementation of

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:47,740
Bitcoin in at realm okay this is like

00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:51,370
Bitcoin in that realm what we see here

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,700
is a balanced mapping and I call it DEP

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,450
coin

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:59,390
and for every the the creator of the

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,380
contract has a lot of depth cones at the

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,100
beginning and then you can execute

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,769
within this program

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,279
everybody can send execute the code

00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:12,829
paying a bit of aether to make transfers

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,920
between people and doing transfers of

00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:19,130
depth coins so this is this is basically

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,860
the what we have right now of Bitcoin in

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,800
I don't 20 lines of code there's another

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,860
contract I made it's a program that you

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,560
can bet your meter so you can send money

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,350
to the this contract and it will flip a

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,250
coin and will give you two times more or

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:40,610
0 so basically it gives you 0 all the

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,959
time well on average right so you can do

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,519
that kind of stuff and you cannot

00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:49,959
control it ok ok so what I want to do

00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:53,750
with that I want to model the Debian

00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:56,779
democracy with at the realm I want to

00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:00,290
implement our interactions with it so

00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:02,930
this is this is just a template I want

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:08,180
to map people and packages that they can

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:10,370
applaud and the new member process and

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,060
so on as an exercise structure I know

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,769
how that room works so this is what I

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,079
said basically I want to rent on and

00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:20,120
they're gonna move at their own so I did

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,459
some basic research recently to do that

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,579
and I implemented some basic stuff like

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:28,010
18 adding DTS and so on there is no

00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:31,850
voting against a dead stuff that may be

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:35,029
a bit complicated by i but i welcome you

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,380
to help me with that we could package at

00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:39,670
your home as well that may be a bit

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:44,029
difficult because it's moving very fast

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:46,040
and so if you are interested please

00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:53,720
contact me I have some aether I can give

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:57,339
it to you so you can play with it and we

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,339
can do something together thank you

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:09,100
okay thank you very much the next person

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,690
is Yvonne all the watch with universal

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:41,070
operating software how to get all

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:41,070
demographics represented just a moment

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,060
please stand by while we while we

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,060
because

00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:25,180
actually we'll actually take this out of

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:27,610
order for the moment so next up for just

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,709
a moment is I three on givin Lopez

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,860
talking about rescue tux which is

00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:38,009
rescued top which is a rescue task based

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,009
Debian live CD you ready

00:12:46,490 --> 00:13:28,050
in just a moment okay

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:31,140
Adrian okay thank you for coming here

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:37,470
I'm going to talk about risk attacks so

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:39,600
let's go what is risk attacks were

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,330
skeptics in the first place

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,290
it's a Debian live CD so it uses the

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:49,740
Daniell life technology its main purpose

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:53,070
is rescue so that means that when your

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:58,940
computer does not boot it helps you so

00:13:53,070 --> 00:14:03,570
that it would Seguin and it has not also

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:06,630
Linux user target in the the users that

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:09,870
are going to use the risk of toxicity

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:15,450
not only our Linux users but all but

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:19,940
also Windows users and its main property

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:24,330
it's just that it's tasks based I mean

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:28,050
most the other rescue cities on the open

00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:31,320
source world give you the tools and you

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:34,440
have to know to know how to use these

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,160
tools with respects you just launch a

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:42,600
task and it does it for you

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:47,100
so on the new linux features section we

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,959
have this some examples we have restore

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:55,099
grip and also restore group

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:58,549
version two we can change the general

00:14:55,099 --> 00:15:02,029
Linux password so that we when forget it

00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:05,659
we can change it for another one or when

00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:09,349
the old sea submarine leaves the the

00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:12,979
company we can set it a new one if we

00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:13,279
are not very good at messing messing

00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,519
with

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,659
sudoers file we can also regenerate it

00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:26,859
so that it works and then we can read it

00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:26,859
and we can do a file system check fsck

00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:32,569
for the windows people we can clear

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,819
windows passwords so that you don't need

00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:37,220
a password to enter into Windows then

00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:42,799
you can set up within Windows and a new

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:47,059
one you can also promote an user so that

00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:50,329
it it is an administrator and miss and I

00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:55,029
mean you can also unlock a Windows user

00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:59,539
because sometimes the accounts sparse

00:15:55,029 --> 00:16:03,289
and you can also restore the windows MBR

00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:07,789
so that if you don't if you are not

00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:13,339
using group you can put with syslinux

00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:17,869
actually and some just some extra

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:21,739
features here's there's there's an a

00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:24,379
screenshot that shows a grid rocket

00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:28,599
greeter from tales

00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:31,669
you know the Technic sticks the city

00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:34,879
where you can choose a language and a

00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:40,929
keyword so that the live CD works with

00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:44,959
your language ready

00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:49,609
so it also to the text architecture at

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,939
boot and it also has look back dot CFG

00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:54,199
support and we are looking for what for

00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:59,749
integrating it back to the real life

00:16:54,199 --> 00:17:01,230
itself so I wanted to present Rose

00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:04,020
Cottage

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:08,130
just in case some of you in the Debian

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:12,150
world did not know about it and also

00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:14,760
because we need help on rewriting and

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,250
testing it for Jessie

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,059
writing the commutation it's like every

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:24,990
other project we need documentation to

00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:28,830
get new features ideas because minute

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:32,270
yeah it's also very important to test

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:36,120
and find to find new books because

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:40,530
depending of the book that it happens

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:43,799
your computer my maze scream and also

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,650
the it will be nice to have you fi

00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:51,559
support for them in life which I think

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:54,870
it it is not currently implemented so

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:58,799
that's it you have plenty of videos in

00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:02,549
YouTube in order to find how risk attack

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:05,390
works and how we see is to use it thank

00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,390
you very much

00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:18,190
okay thank you very much next up is

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:21,640
Ritchie Hartman with how to use get to

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,580
manage your digital life and here he

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,250
comes

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:29,590
thank you so most of you will probably

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,810
have used it at some point in your life

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:36,370
but you probably mostly use it for code

00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:40,840
to check out to to to distribute code or

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:43,630
whatever thing is it's useful for a lot

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,790
more than just using it for plain source

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,940
code there are examples for example if

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,440
you want to do configuration management

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,920
some people just think of pushing things

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,860
out

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,390
Popat assaults like what-have-you but if

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,150
you want to have backups revision

00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,890
backups of your of your configuration it

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,440
would make sense to how to not have this

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,630
in a large huge backup file just have

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,580
one distinct repository with all the

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,220
changes which it can then track all of a

00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:12,460
sudden and blaming it on people or

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:15,250
whatever so for example you could use

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,440
etc' keeper for this there's also the

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,320
possibility to use it for to manage your

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,230
block and just have it at the background

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,380
of your blogging engine if you put an

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:30,280
example for this and then there's my my

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:32,830
main motivation for standing here to

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,460
actually manage your own configuration

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:38,620
your own home basically to just manage

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,130
all of you to get your life in your home

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,900
user or in you use a home with get there

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,030
would be two tools for this we see a

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,580
sage to manage all your user

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,590
configuration and get an X to basically

00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,310
manage everything else which allows you

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:57,010
to maintain information about files in

00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:59,590
git and synchronizes across arbitrary

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,740
hosts and have arbitrary subsets subsets

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:06,040
of files but you don't have to check in

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,290
all the data in to get so but it takes

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,930
care of of tracking this where it isn't

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,930
just copying it back and forth by rules

00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:16,720
which you can define all of this really

00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:22,410
quick there will be a buff tomorrow at

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,410
1530 in room Amsterdam which is in

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,730
where you're more than welcome to join

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:31,520
and either tell us how you are using it

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:33,980
for non coat purposes or on the other

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:41,830
hand just learn how others are doing it

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:46,100
and basically exchange ideas okay so

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:50,150
yeah okay any no no no questions at this

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:54,550
point so just as a quick example of what

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:57,170
you know there's one more tool mr which

00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,360
you probably want to use if you have

00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,300
more than one repository that's all of

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,760
you basically it takes out the pain out

00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:07,310
of managing your repositories if you say

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,480
have 20 repositories from one project

00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,310
and then you have a few for work you

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,980
have a few for your configurations

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:17,090
whatever keeping all of those up-to-date

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,190
is a kind of pain in yes if you have one

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,260
single tool to just keep track of all of

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,570
those repositories and then update them

00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,220
on when you want to or just push out new

00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:28,070
information to your repository up

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,320
streams when you need to all of a sudden

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,060
this becomes one single command and even

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,000
five minutes of Wi-Fi at the local

00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:37,430
airport will just be enough to get

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:43,370
everything synchronized down and and

00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:47,320
upwards again thank you again

00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,320
15:30 tomorrow Amsterdam

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,590
I think that gives Ritchie the land

00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,940
speed record he's still got he's

00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,210
actually still got the only two minutes

00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,929
left

00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:01,240
never mind long-anticipated now we have

00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:02,919
Yvonne all are speaking about universal

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:08,440
operating software how to get all

00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:11,529
demographics represented hello hi my

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,909
name is Ivana loach I'm from Kenya and I

00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:15,580
thought I'd do this talk because I'm

00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:18,009
sure most of you are wondering I'm new

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:22,659
this is my first day of curve to attend

00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:25,840
and I got to learn about then curve last

00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:29,620
year I was in a women in tech conference

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,000
well women women technologists rocketed

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:35,740
from Africa and abroad for our

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,720
conference in Germany and I met a band

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,370
contributor from there who say that

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,679
fitting well in this group I don't know

00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,529
what criteria she used but then that's

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,179
how for myself so this year when there

00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,549
was outreach program I tried

00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:50,019
contributing in documentation by the

00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:52,919
nostril documentation had been phased

00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:56,740
out there's no longer that then I tried

00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:59,679
I was told my back and tried to maintain

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,659
Debian which I'm walking it's a walking

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,879
progress like today in the morning I was

00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:06,730
so happy to learn I was being taught how

00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:08,889
to use BTS which is very nice and I

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,080
found it's very simple and doable so I

00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,610
thought I'd give a talk on how to

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,330
increase more diversity in Debian

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,620
because this is the first diversity

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,789
section that you guys have created and I

00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:24,460
am very honored to be here to represent

00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:26,169
Africa as a whole and also specifically

00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,509
with diversity I'd like to put more

00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:29,889
focus in women more women African being

00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:32,710
represented in Debian you have a very

00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:34,870
good number of women technologists in

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,509
Kenya who are doing well in open source

00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,159
and if we can get more of that into this

00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:43,539
community I think could be great

00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:44,950
so women developers in Kenya if if

00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:47,440
you've been in Africa and especially

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,899
Kenya you know I hope I have dot-com

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,289
emember there and statistically speaking

00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:56,139
alike 15% or women technologies there

00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:59,409
web developers mobile developers and

00:23:56,139 --> 00:24:01,240
doing other things in tech and to get

00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:03,370
more women participation

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,230
I was looking at this structure under

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,420
which Debian operates its volunteerism

00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:09,220
so like you get three hours out of your

00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,770
normal day job and you get to add

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,350
something in Debian if you look into the

00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:16,990
Kenyan context that's another field

00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:19,090
that's a long shot because for for

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:23,860
someone to like get two hours a day to

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:25,530
contribute faster just the cultural

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,090
setup that you have back home I think

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,860
might not fit well but with the time I'm

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:33,160
sure it will fit if we get the right

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:36,220
target audience then also how do you tap

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,650
into the developers community so my

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,900
suggestion was that if we were to get

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,730
more women developers them into Debian

00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,830
I'd really appreciate if you can do

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,390
partnership with an organization for

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,870
women in tech in Kenya known as akhirah

00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,750
chicks

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,370
it's a targets young women who are

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,100
either studying computer science or

00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:57,310
computer engineering and then we train

00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,570
them into we train them into programming

00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,150
teaching them various software

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,800
programming languages and I'm part of

00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,660
archaeologic sand from days where I came

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,040
up with an initiative known as cards and

00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,440
which stands for social akane

00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:12,520
individuals redefining technology spaces

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:15,730
and we do create we do meetups once a

00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,890
month or as frequent as possible with

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:21,150
the availability of resources and we

00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:23,980
ensure that you build the technology

00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:27,790
community for women in the Kenyan

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:31,420
society so if we can do the same with

00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:33,940
Debian because we've before we do the

00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:36,400
long shot of someone having time to

00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,310
spend choice or one hour on their own we

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,680
need to personal feel we need to do more

00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,830
meetups get more people encouraged so

00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,000
that without that they know they feel

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:48,780
compelled even when they're on their own

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,760
to do some contribution in Debian then

00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,380
with that also baton goes hand in hand

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,270
with how to maintain women in this

00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,640
community so regular meetups

00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:00,820
then also mentor mentee program

00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,530
physically besides them when you guys

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,710
the the beside the one day band already

00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:08,290
has online because when I tried

00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:10,390
contributing during our tree team you

00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,130
had to be your to be connected you being

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,500
a mentee and you have a mentor guides

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,789
you through that so I also appreciate as

00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,089
much

00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:21,359
we have that online you can also do the

00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:23,789
physical mental mangy program and also I

00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:27,690
looked into the Debian wiki for Deb come

00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:28,979
for 2016 or depth of 16 and the you guys

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,379
had already talked about this

00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:33,029
organizing remote Debian conferences to

00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:37,849
attract more people which is a good step

00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:41,879
and I've support that so Devin is

00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:44,999
volunteer community which is working

00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:48,659
well to continue creating more support

00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:50,309
for first and I know it's just needs

00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,440
dedication and determination for people

00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:54,179
to contribute to this so I hope the

00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,129
materials available and resources can

00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,529
help to grow that and attract more and I

00:26:56,129 --> 00:27:07,649
hope to see more African women in Depok

00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:10,139
of 16 thank you thank you very much one

00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:38,519
more one more speaker sue Nevada talking

00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:39,679
about QML okay okay so am i loud and

00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,709
clear

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,299
great so this is a five minute edition

00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:49,379
of the talk that I'm going to do on

00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:53,849
Monday at 2:00 in here so hang on this

00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:56,069
is about qml how to write fancy GUI

00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:58,589
application in the in the modern world

00:27:56,069 --> 00:28:02,279
and we'll have this simple application

00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:07,199
it's a rectangle that has a size and we

00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:09,289
can run it simple so let's make it a bit

00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:14,279
bit more complex

00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:21,209
we could say let's put let's make it it

00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:23,069
red and Tara or live and we could

00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:28,640
continue saying we want another

00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:33,919
rectangle and we wanted to say

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,919
we wanted to bind find it so that it

00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:41,179
fits in half of the width rectangle

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:55,450
this is basically anchoring things to

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:58,210
each other saying that this inner

00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:01,960
rectangle is going to have Kevin Parrom

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:07,210
matching the parent rectangle and right

00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:14,790
is the the same parent that right

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:17,680
and finally and left is parent

00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:21,850
horizontal Center so now we have a red

00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:26,230
square and white square covering half of

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:36,130
it so let's try to say maybe we want a

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:45,040
bit of text in the middle and we have a

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:48,550
text saying debconf and here we have a

00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:53,200
text placed in the middle next let's do

00:29:48,550 --> 00:30:00,280
a bit of a mouse interaction what about

00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:01,870
seeing a mouse area and let's just a

00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:09,580
little little fill the white word

00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:11,910
rectangle and when clicked let's do some

00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,910
magic

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:27,280
no with the white one because it is it

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:29,470
is it is a child of the the white one so

00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,930
now we have a wide rectangle if I click

00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:35,670
it we get a debug output saying clicked

00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:39,130
but that's not not fancy enough for this

00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:41,320
so let us extend them saying let's give

00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:46,750
this text an ID saying let's call it

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:56,910
text field and when clicked so let's say

00:30:46,750 --> 00:31:01,000
text field that rotation plus equals 180

00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:05,140
so we have now when we're clicking it it

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:10,470
is basically being rotated but we can

00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:15,100
get it even more fancy say so let's say

00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:23,980
whenever the rotation changes of the

00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:29,200
text field behavior on let's just do a

00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:33,250
number at number animation and we should

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:41,440
just seeing it actually flip nice and

00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:45,310
and smoothly okay and this is more or

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:49,330
less the basics of of all the of where

00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:53,320
we'll start on Monday so everybody show

00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:58,770
up on Monday in here around - I think

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,770
but details in the schedule have fun

00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,980
