00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,650

welcome to participate everyone is

welcome to participate we would like to

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,390
create a situation in which people who

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,280
don't know each other can relax and

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,039
interact freely in a place that is

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,790
welcoming and non-judgmental open to

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,619
exchanges of opinions and experiences

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,810
everyone is free to choose how much to

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,420
participate you can choose to interact

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,840
or just to lurk or to take some time off

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,810
for yourself as you prefer and change

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,850
your mind at any time this is true for

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,439
this session as well as for the rest of

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:27,240
the conference and it includes

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:31,020
games of mouth for anything that is not

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,299
said here you can ask from desk any

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,220
question from desk is the people over

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:41,939
there that you probably have already met

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:49,890
they give you these things this is the

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:51,840
Debian diversity diversity state that is

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,909
valid for Debian and is valid for the

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,860
staff conf that comes the Debian project

00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:01,979
including DEP conf welcomes and

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,469
encourages participation by everyone no

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,930
matter how you identify yourself or how

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,509
others perceive you we welcome you

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,340
we welcome contributions from everyone

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,620
as long as they interact constructively

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,900
with our community

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,239
and while much of the work for our

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,400
project is technical in nature we value

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,739
and encourage contributions from those

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,010
with expertise in other areas and

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:30,420
welcome them in our community so that's

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:40,620
the setting for their conf to which you

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:47,910
are welcome we the the the idea of this

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:49,110
moment is split in several steps that

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:56,700
was step one

00:02:49,110 --> 00:03:00,930
welcome right that was step zero

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:05,879
step one is tips and tricks that will

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:08,250
come later and then we have stories in

00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,379
which people who have been to that

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,709
comfort before and people who haven't

00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:17,269
can tell stories from past that comes or

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,590
stories on how you got here and then

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:23,630
there's our getting to know each other

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:30,299
session in which we go around and

00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:33,060
introduce each other to each other how

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:36,750
many of you are adapt come for the first

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:46,540
time yes

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:53,940
that's fantastic and how many of you

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:58,959
have been here before so in depth cough

00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:03,090
okay so we have stories good good I

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,090
guess we can go on with tips and tricks

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:13,360
so there are several resources the wiki

00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:17,290
has is very well curated how many of you

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:24,490
have not seen the wiki DEP DEP Kampf

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:26,979
wiki yet good so okay it's also

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,490
reasonably well advertised and if you

00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:31,780
haven't seen it yet you can have a look

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,030
there's the mailing list

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,900
there's the DEP cough discuss mailing

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,700
lists that can be used for anything that

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:45,130
goes around the dep Kampf lost-and-found

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:47,560
like I lost somebody today lost a piece

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,979
of cloth for the laptop that had a cheat

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,680
sheet of UNIX things it's probably at

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,270
front desk and if you look for you lost

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,669
your wallet and you're looking for it or

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,550
something you can post to the DEP Kampf

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:02,740
disgust list you want to keep an eye to

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:07,300
it because occasionally people post

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:09,490
about non-official debconf activities

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:14,550
like there was one posted yesterday

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:17,350
which is made for running this morning

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,930
for a certain amount of kilometer at a

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,880
specific average speed and if you keep

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,820
up with the others you just make it back

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:29,520
in time for breakfast

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:31,690
I really like that one but I didn't go

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,090
but there's a lot there's people going

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,190
swimming people going dancing there's a

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,970
lot of things that happen beside step

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,740
Kampf because we are all kind of I mean

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,290
I guess most of the people at debconf

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,690
are used to organizing things in a way

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,960
or another related to debian or not and

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:54,340
so things happen

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:56,740
there's IRC there's a hashtag conf which

00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:01,240
has the bot that tells you if people

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:05,200
arrived tells you when lunch starts and

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:08,170
you can use it to look for people ask if

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:14,620
people want to join you for a round of

00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:16,300
laundry or gay some game if you're

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,420
looking for someone you go there and say

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,220
can anyone see that person we have an

00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:26,830
excellent spy system around the

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:31,150
conference and for anything else

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,650
medical emergency was by stings laundry

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,750
tourist information practical

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,750
information you can ask from desk

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:48,450
normally as of that that was general

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,450
tips and tricks about the location

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,020
normally there is a quiet hot club and

00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:05,530
the normal ha Club I still haven't found

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:09,460
out which one is which this year it

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,590
seems that Paris our club is quiet but

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:16,960
if you are in a noisy hot club you can

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:19,650
ask on IRC is there quiet hot club ash

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,650
debconf

00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:29,860
last time I checked the only smoking

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:32,380
place was the beer garden tables which

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,790
is the tables outside that are longer

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,580
and kind of red and they have ashtrays

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,710
on top

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,080
there might be no smoking sign showing

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,689
up in the next days but the designated

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,409
areas are most kind of that's for

00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:51,360
smoking and the rest mostly smoking free

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:53,669
there is frequently asked questions

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,930
about the DEP convened a wiki that are

00:07:53,669 --> 00:08:03,479
quite detailed so that's also worth a

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:08,129
look then in terms of about

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:12,509
person-to-person interaction there are

00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:16,740
more not non-native English speakers

00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:20,009
than native speakers so don't worry too

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,960
much about your English it's unlikely

00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:25,020
that you are speaking with somebody that

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,629
grew up speaking it anyway don't think

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,449
about it too much don't try to leave a

00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:39,329
good impression don't try to be perfect

00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:41,640
keep it simple but say it if you can say

00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:46,860
something try to do that without

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:50,190
thinking about the English and if you

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,990
are a native English speaker keep in

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,360
mind that there's more non-native

00:08:51,990 --> 00:09:00,329
speakers than native speakers we can

00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:02,790
beat you know actually is quite

00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:05,760
important because sometimes native

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:09,660
speakers don't realize how fast they are

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,930
tolkien or when they use slang words or

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,870
some kind of jargon and it's very

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:19,110
difficult to follow and it's irritating

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,420
to always says can you repeat please can

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,260
you repeat most slowly so I can

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,899
understand that

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:30,870
it's not easy for you guys to think

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:34,079
about talking slowly but please do so

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:37,800
speak slowly avoid too many slang terms

00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:41,660
or maybe double check that the other

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,660
person is still attentive

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,960
keep moderate a bit your assertiveness

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,570
if you're a natural English speaker

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,450
another person may not be able to keep

00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,920
up if you're very assertive they they

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:02,100
may have to deal with your assertiveness

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,050
and the language and they may be able to

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,790
keep up with your assertiveness in their

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:11,280
native language but with both things

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:15,930
could be quite daunting give some time

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:20,240
to people to understand and reply there

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:24,270
was a kind of interesting

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,410
rule of thumb that when you finish when

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,650
you when you have finished saying

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,750
something count to three before saying

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,660
something else and yeah that kinda

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,600
leaves a pause for the other person to

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:41,970
finish parsing the audio that was

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:45,930
buffered in streaming build the syntax

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:50,300
tree navigated compile optimize

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,300
understand figure out a reply and say

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,900
some of us need multiple passes

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,190
don't be afraid to go and give a person

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:10,050
positive feedback be it on the tab in

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:12,630
water talk or their funny t-shirt a very

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:16,790
good way to be in the center of things

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:19,830
is to volunteer as video team front desk

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:22,860
it's easy it's fun you can do it an hour

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:28,650
a day you get to know interesting people

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:34,950
you may get a t-shirt so yeah with a

00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:38,910
special color and feel free to get out

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:42,330
of your comfort zone don't spend time

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:44,760
only with people from your own your own

00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,650
nationality or only with people you

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,339
already understand but you can go and

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:54,210
experiment

00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:58,800
there's loads of us so if you stay in

00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:02,940
your group of 20 mates you may miss the

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,890
remaining 580 and then you go home and

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,750
you're like oh my god it was like it's

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,990
so many wonderful people and I've no

00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:14,459
idea who they were I would be ashamed

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:16,170
but no means no so whenever you have

00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,450
been out of your comfort zone too much

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,180
feel free to go and have a walk along

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:28,339

who's not speaking it joins you try to

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:52,070
switch to English so that kind of

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:55,760
include others in the conversation then

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:59,940
other activities if you like card games

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,410
keep an eye on now players generally a

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,530
cluster of people around the table

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:08,329
playing at night and saying silly things

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,329
do not ask about the rules

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:21,700
but feel free to join there are games of

cycling swimming dancing running key

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:51,010
signing key signing is an interesting

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:52,870
way to get to know each other and I

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:59,970
think that was mostly it for tips and

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:59,970
tricks and questions

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,910
see Frieza

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,750
yeah I can I have a dresser for the

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:15,570
other since J game I haven't seen it yet

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:18,780
I've heard people talk about assassins

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:22,200
but I never played it I mean I played it

00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:24,570
once and I was like okay I know but

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,280
because you said it is but I haven't

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:32,550
found the answer to this year

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:35,010
yes three days ago and nobody knew

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:38,790
nobody knew perhaps there is no

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:49,350
assassins game that would be a shame a

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:51,750
real shame it could be that this

00:14:49,350 --> 00:15:01,290
assassins game was from during the camp

00:14:51,750 --> 00:15:23,270
from the other group oh you can organize

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:23,270
one so stories what you mean the game I

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:34,290
was trying to make everyone lose the

00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:41,220
game now okay

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:49,500
stories we need volunteers to tell

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:51,180
stories of past that comes and who would

00:15:49,500 --> 00:16:00,680
like who would like to be the first to

00:15:51,180 --> 00:16:04,260
tell a story about a past conf vacant hi

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:07,560
about 11 years ago I went to my first

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:10,770
step Kampf I was invited to go it was

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,960
the first time I left the country in

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,380
such a way that I needed a passport and

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:20,410
only previously been to Canada

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:23,090
it was a long haul on a flight to Brazil

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:26,360
had some interesting adventures getting

00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:29,090
in visa to get to Brazil and and then I

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,550
get there and there's a swarm of people

00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,440
with like names I've recognized that I

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,230
sort of have kind of been lurking on

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,960
Debian channels and sort of seeing all

00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,700
these people and they're all like they

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,910
seem to kind of know each other and

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:47,530
they're talking to each other and and we

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:51,800
walked to this little this dinner event

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:54,680
and I started just kind of shutting down

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,110
I could barely even think straight

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,280
I was having trouble figuring out what

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:03,400
to eat and I just kind of collapsed

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,400
mentally like there was this this

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:09,230
resounding cacophony of languages and

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,610
accents and I couldn't even distinguish

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:15,770
what was a language and what was an

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:18,020
accent and I I just sort of kind of

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,500
collapsed on the table just with my head

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,700
down I was just kind of losing it and

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,830
some of the people who invited me there

00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,110
as a kind of a part of the group as a

00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:29,900
Debby nonprofit project they kind of

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:32,390
just you know asked me what was wrong

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,790
you know I wasn't even speaking and

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,820
they're just you know comforting but not

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,590
pushing too hard and this happened a few

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,200
more times throughout the conference I

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,060
recovered we got some really cool work

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,010
done I met some really amazing people

00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:50,420
and then you know I would occasionally

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:53,300
collapse and just I don't know culture

00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,430
shock maybe but eventually I recovered

00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:59,110
and we've got some great things done and

00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,110
I've been coming back ever since

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:20,670

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:26,220

Debian but I've been using it since well

00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:08,670
my first one was was in Oslo that was

00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:11,850
2002 maybe three and I was I was really

00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:14,400
afraid of going I had been yeah using

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,440
Debian for some time already and my

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,680
boyfriend was the Debian developer and

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,810

00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:25,230
hosts week and I was like also like

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,180
tired from the traveling and and I came

there and people asked me like well what

00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:32,640
do you do for Debian and I was like I

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,370
was really embarrassed I was like I use

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,560
it and then people weren't like yeah we

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,560
have a user like how cool we have a user

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:50,470
and it was really nice week I I ended up

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,600
talking about the bugs that I had

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,340
reported and talking about the things

00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,950
that were working well and the things

00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:00,160
that were confusing and got to know lots

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:03,160
of people and then of course when Def

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,410

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,660
little bit more involved and a little

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:13,990
bit well yeah not any less of a user

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,730
though but anyway yeah so so don't be

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,160

I think I've seen a flyer at another

00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:24,820

name's indie bio on IRC I realized that

00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:02,610
a thing like Debian exists I think last

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,100
August

00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:13,620
my boyfriend is a Debian developer now

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:15,960
since two days ago and even his friends

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,940
managed to talk me into organizing the

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:31,970
next step come with them in Cape Town

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:36,000
next year so I'm here to fast up coach

00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:39,179
so I think I didn't count but it's my

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,289
tenth step conf I took part in zero and

00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:45,210
one in in Bordeaux and people ask me

00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:48,299
what my background of my computer is

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:52,260
maybe some people see it is this a world

00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:55,020
map and I've made stripes well so it's

00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:58,020
kind of Debian travel I would call it is

00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:01,230
there are Minitab conf and so so if you

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:04,409
are invited to some places because you

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:08,010
are active you can see the whole world

00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:10,039
with Debian this is really cool thank

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,039

tribute contributors to the Debian

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:42,399
project I unfortunately missed Deb conf

00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,130
is zero and one because they were held

00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:47,200
in Bordeaux on weeks which conflicted

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,539
with a week that my family used to get

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,690
together is a large group at a beach

00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:54,730
house and do family things but I've been

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,279
to every Deb comp since DEFCON number

00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,679
two which was the year that I was the

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,389
Debian project leader I've been actively

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,039
involved in the project ever since I'm

00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:04,779
still a member of the Debian Technical

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,510
Committee I'm president of software in

00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:08,710
the public interest which is the

00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,600
financial and legal umbrella for

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,970
Debian's activities in the United States

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,820
and I just wanted to tell all of you how

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:18,820
thrilled I am to see so many new faces

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:21,669
this year I understand that we either

00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:24,460
have or are likely to set a new record

00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:26,049
for attendance at Deb conf which for a

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,169
project that I have been personally

00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:31,649
involved in since 1994 is just really

00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:33,789
really cool so thank you all of you

00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:36,279
particularly those of you who are here

00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:37,899
for the first time for thinking this was

00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,600
something you wanted to come spend some

00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:42,070
time doing and if you see me or other

00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,409
people who look like they've been around

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,269
for a long time and seem to be deep in

00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,220
conversation and you're worried about

00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:49,899
interrupting us or something please just

00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,370
come up and join the conversation and

00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:53,980
say hello and tell us who you are and

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:57,850
ask questions because that's what this

00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:01,510
is all about one other little detail I

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:05,019
work for HP by day I'm very pleased that

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:07,419
over the years HP has ended up being one

00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:09,220
of if not the largest overall

00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:10,630
contributors to the financial

00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,760
sponsorship of debconf

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,710
the first year that HP provided

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,149
financial sponsorship for the conference

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:21,370
was DEFCON 3 and Helsinki and we haven't

00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:23,929
always been the biggest sponsor in any

00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:26,299
given year but this year we are and

00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:29,419
have been for many many years so even

00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:32,090
though I took early retirement in 2012

00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:34,669
and then allowed my arm to be twisted

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,340
last year to go back and try and do some

00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:39,980
work for HP again it's really cool for

00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,840
me to not only have been able to be

00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,200
personally involved for a long time but

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,330
to have been able to help motivate

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,340
financial sponsorship that's made travel

00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,679
support for some of you possible over

00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,450
the years so please feel free to come by

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,190
and say hello I will look forward to

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,190
talking many of you of this week thanks

00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:20,990
okay third part and sorry I am the

00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:24,580
introverted one of the two so I told

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:29,809
very slowly and I'll be very embarrassed

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:34,309
so for the third part we wanted to set

00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:38,539
up a game that I'll break in the highs

00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:40,279
between people and the idea is that and

00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:43,490
of course you can decide to not

00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:47,059
participate it's okay the the point is

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:49,519
to exit a little bit from your comfort

00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:53,749
zone but not too much if it's stressful

00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:57,110
feel free to avoid it and it's okay so

00:27:53,749 --> 00:28:00,559
the idea is you take a piece of paper

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:03,200
and a pen pens are very important

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,860
because from the reception and they want

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:15,470
all of them all 45 of them back so

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:20,840
please please okay the idea is you

00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:24,379
divide the paper in four sections and in

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,450
the first one you should try what brings

00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:29,269
you to DEFCON four in general what you

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:32,570
do in Debian if you're a contributor or

00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:35,210
what you do computer-related because I'm

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,950
assuming here that you're probably here

00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,740
because you're interested in free

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,290
software

00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,080
you do something in free software or

00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:47,820
you're just very interested in it so

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:58,830
first part is that I'll probably repeat

00:28:47,820 --> 00:29:07,080
it so it's okay I look for some more can

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:13,340
you pass on quite a lot of people here

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:16,830
I didn't realize yeah so first sections

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:19,620
what brings you to that Kampf Oh what

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:23,220
you do in Debian what you do in the free

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:26,309
software world so something about you

00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:41,970
that is Debian or free software really

00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:45,440
it's basically second part no okay I'll

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:49,100
wait you just tell me when I can go I

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:53,010
was actually going to judge this demand

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:56,790
so those of you who have a pen use it

00:29:53,010 --> 00:30:00,620
because we only have 45 I realized the

00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:05,550
folly way they are very precious and

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:11,990
bring them back and I have Pentium is a

00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:11,990
pen first mom

00:30:18,200 --> 00:31:06,890
bus okay in Fulton for yes this is quite

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:10,370
improvised so we are not sure out Erica

00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,370
I'll do that

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,080
