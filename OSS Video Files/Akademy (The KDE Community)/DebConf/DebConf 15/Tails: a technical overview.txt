Tails is a Debian GNU/Linux based live system that aims to preserve user privacy  and anonymity. This talk gives an overview on the technical details behind Tails, how privacy, anonymity and security are enforced on top of Debian. We will explain the challenges that Tails faces. This talk also presents the current
Tails project roadmap and future goals, and the evolution of the relation with Debian, from
a technical point of view.

	00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:11,820
so hello thank you for coming we are

00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:15,049
going to give a talk about we're going

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:19,289
to give a technical overview of tails

00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:31,679
that's corn all individually and I'm

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:35,040
biting bad what so we are all tails

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:42,450
contributors in different fields

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:46,829
I don't do technical things individual

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:51,500
is so one of the oldest tails

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:56,760
contributors and qivana contribute since

00:00:51,500 --> 00:01:00,539
some years now yeah two years so tails

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,379
is the acronym of the music in connect

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,520
or live system and here is a nice URL

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,400
where you can have all the information

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:17,070
so it's a live a parting system it works

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:22,290
on almost any computer except arm and it

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:24,990
puts a DVD or USB stick and poetic the

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:31,790
from SD card to but it doesn't work very

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:36,540
well so the focus of our distribution is

00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:42,920
privacy and anonymity so it allows the

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:46,140
user to use Internet anonymously and

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,850
also when they are censorship to

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,280
circumvent it so all the connections to

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:58,170
the Internet Kazuto which is an

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,960
anonymous Asian Network and so that's

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,719
the first big picture a big feature of

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,689
tales and the second one is that there's

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,830
no twice and the computer you're using

00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:13,950
so that after you use it nobody can see

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:18,490
that you've used the comp

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:21,310
so if somebody were to grab your

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:24,370
computer and search right they would not

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,980
know what you have done

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:33,390
yeah unless you ask for it explicit it's

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:38,430
aging and more and we have also a lot of

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:43,209
desktop and data producing tools because

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:48,010
some people some users use it to write

00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:50,620
books out news articles video and such

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:54,910
things and they want to be able to

00:02:50,620 --> 00:03:02,350
create such documents without being

00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:06,760
traced so does it work so we have a very

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:09,550
good report not from our user actually

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,220
from how you know the people we are

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:18,690
supposed to protect against so the NSA

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:21,910
says that it's a pain in the ass and so

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,130
when the NSA says you're making their

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,670
life harder somehow you're doing

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,670
something right

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:39,280
and I guess you can imagine who's a

00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,310
famous stage user who gave us access to

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,830
the documents well they say that

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:55,210
and there's also Bushnell who says he

00:03:47,830 --> 00:04:01,030
uses tails so not not bad so what our

00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:03,250
goals we took a stance in the beginning

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,400
of tails that it was not really common

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:10,120
back then to have usability as a

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,520
security feature because uber geeks were

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,660
already able to have secure

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,609
communications and the thing is privacy

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,590
is not an individual matter it's a

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:28,240
collective matter everybody needs to

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:31,870
have privacy and new users and non geek

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,030
users had no way of having access to

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,850
those because the tools existed but they

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:40,800
were they had no user interface or they

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:44,200
were really hard to configure so we

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,290
design a system that gives a quite good

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,410
level of security with a quite good

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:53,650
level of usability and lots of the time

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,960
people ask us why we don't include more

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,419
security feature and we have to make a

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,760
balance between security and usability

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:03,100
because if it's really secure but nobody

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:08,620
can use it then it doesn't bring

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:15,010
anything so it makes security accessible

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:17,830
for most people another important point

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:22,800
in our project is to have a very small

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:26,620
Delta to our upstream so our upstream

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:31,600
main upstream being Debian and we try to

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:34,419
not diverge too much from it so because

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,460
the more you do things differently is

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,250
the more work you have to maintain it's

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,919
not the work is not the work of doing

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,270
implementing something once it's a work

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,680
of maintaining on the

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:50,500
town and there were a lot and a lot of

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,930
other security distribution and there

00:05:50,500 --> 00:06:00,940
are still a few others but most of them

00:05:52,930 --> 00:06:03,370
have a very short lifespan because to

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,370
maintain I mean it's a distribution and

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,780
we are not well a very tiny team

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,930
compared to Debian but we're a team and

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,900
lots of other privacy distribution where

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:21,130
is a one person of very tiny tiny teams

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:25,510
and that didn't make out which to be

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:28,660
joined by more people most other privacy

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:33,010
distribution don't didn't take into

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:36,340
account maintenance maintenance work and

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,500
the user support because even if we try

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:42,850
to make it usable it's still a lot of

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:46,110
work to teach the users how to use it

00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,850
and to document how you use to use it

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,880
also if you want to start such a project

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:55,300
you need to have a long-term commitment

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:59,710
and to remember to avoid the symptom of

00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:02,560
not invented here it's quite common to

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,690
try to do some things that does exactly

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,350
what you want but sometimes it's best to

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:12,400
find an existing software that does

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:17,770
something close enough and today to make

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:22,330
the news features you want in it ou use

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,880
it as it is so we are trying to do most

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:29,950
of our work well at least a good part of

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,080
our work up to him so we did a Parma in

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:35,740
Debian specifically there's an atomic

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:40,120
team an anonymity tools team and an OTA

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:45,640
Tim who work on things that we use

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:49,660
entails Lib feared C hosts and pipette

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:53,560
our other projects we contributed to in

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:56,530
order to instead of implementing what we

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,770
needed entails we did it upstream and it

00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,880
too

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:04,539
longer and it took longer to fall down

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:08,530
to us but so it's maintainable when we

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:13,690
finally have the new features we have no

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:16,030
work of keeping the new features so as a

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,000
result we have really little tailed

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,490
specific code we mostly do glue work

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,479
between the code we take from our app

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:28,870
streams and we do a lot of social work

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:31,630
we talk to upstream we spread the word

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:37,120
we say oh that would be great if

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:39,700
somebody were to work on that and we

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,979
find the people that have the right

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:46,510
skills to do the work where it should be

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:50,680
done when it's not entails we have a

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:53,080
very slow rhythm because we work in

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,810
debian so we have to wait until the next

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,740
debian version is released to see the

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:02,290
work we've done entails for example

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:06,070
otama I mentioned earlier we did it in

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:08,890
Debian so for two years that was work

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:16,420
going on in Debian that was not visible

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:18,279
in tails but we finally have it and stay

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:24,370
tail is still alive because it's

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:29,190
maintainable so implementation details

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,190
so that's where I give the mic work

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:49,440
so talking about the implementation we

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,240
have to say that it tells is like an

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,060
implementation or at least the furious

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,670
implementation of our design that we

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,399
have called a private privacy enhancing

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:02,459
live distribution we can you see in that

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,829
link the idea with that document was to

00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:07,829
define like a solute set of features

00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:09,990
that any distribution that we would like

00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:13,079
to to enforce security and privacy and

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:16,170
anonymity for the user we have to to

00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:19,500
have as a sense tells is the first

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:22,470
implementation of this document of

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,769
course is as you know maybe this is

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:30,269
based on and Debian and now currently it

00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:33,300
works over the B&B see we see and now we

00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:37,680
are migrating to GC and we try to do in

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:40,769
the in the next months so what the main

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,220
software that runs on tails of course we

00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:48,410
use tor the tor browser and genome and

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:51,510
third as probably you know this this

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:54,000
anonymity tool that allows the people to

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,760
connect it to the internet to rewrite

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,850
the traffic between different servers

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:04,649
and in an encrypted way so he allows to

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:06,240
stay a or to hide your new location and

00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:10,470
the tor browser is this a tool that

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:14,519
allows to to use tor in a easy way like

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,500
in a very convenient wait on lead you

00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,920
have to install the the browser and

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:23,329
under seats

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:27,300
so talking out the features of taste the

00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:31,470
we said before that the ideas to use the

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:34,350
internet and only anonymously so the

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,660
idea is that for all the software that

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,880
we have installed Intel's we blocked all

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,180
the connections that are not going to

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,029
route or everything that tries to reach

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:51,180
the internet there is not been by tories

00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:53,160
block yet and we try to have like a very

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,040
good configuration for that

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,220
who's that we chipped that so they can

00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,740
connect through the Tor network and it's

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,649
almost immiscible for the users so the

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,990
user doesn't have to to care about who

00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:08,519
is going to the internet he can be

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:13,889
assured that everything is going to turn

00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:16,439
so he's protected we have an alternative

00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:18,569
to to tor that is called AI to P which

00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:21,629
is does something similar with the

00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:24,389
different technologies a different

00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:27,029
architecture this is not enabled by

00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:34,980
default the user if the user wants to

00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:37,470
use it he has to enable and we have user

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,319
case that sometimes the user is like

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,420
let's say in a hotel or in metro station

00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:45,360
and he wants to connect the internet but

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:49,160
he cannot use tor in Italy and he has to

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,629
connect to a captive portal then we have

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,949
unsafe browser that allows the user to

00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:57,810
to to to connect directly to to the

00:12:55,949 --> 00:13:01,529
internet but he has a lot of deadside

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:07,199
sinus and labels tool to say that you

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:10,620
are not secure in in that way so he

00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,100
tells the process of installation of

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,610
stales

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:18,449
was done before looked like very in very

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:20,730
manually way we have like a lot of

00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:24,569
documentation about it but now we have

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:28,800
at change this installer that currently

00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:31,019
is working only inside tails and but we

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,350
are working to create like a different

00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,509
version for the several systems for

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:41,910
example we are almost done with the

00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:44,850
Debian version but we also want to have

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,149
like an Ubuntu version even a Windows

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:54,509
version so it gets very very easy to

00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:58,139
twist old tales we are like trying to

00:13:54,509 --> 00:14:02,610
convert this software which is writing

00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:06,949
in Python to use eg take3 and you this

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,949
too so

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,850
so annoyed of the important feature of

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:16,700
tales art was commented before is that

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:19,820
the idea we don't want to leave any

00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,580
trace in the computer so basically we

00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:26,000
don't write anything anything in the in

00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:30,620
the hard drive in the disks at least not

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,170
in the in the non removable disk just

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,410
when when the the tailless is running

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:39,740
and it is shooted down and or the USB

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:42,800
stick when it is installed that is most

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:47,930
of the case is taken off the computer so

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:50,150
the idea do we whip the memory and raise

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:53,300
everything that is that is the earth

00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:55,910
like keys or whatever it's even

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,970
sensitive information that is in there

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:02,450
we try to delete it and we use for that

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:05,150
we use in this package that there is in

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,460
Debian this is secure delete and more

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:16,070
specifically the tool that is called as

00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:18,890
the mem for that so talking about so the

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,770
idea is that we don't want to leave any

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,110
trace in the computer but sometimes the

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:27,320
user needs to store some informations

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,660
and if they are using tears inside a USB

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,430
stick so we are providing the

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,580
possibility to store this all

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,760
information inside the USB stick in one

00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:41,360
partition we are using for that looks

00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,730
and we are using an encrypted GPT

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:50,930
partition we that we call the test data

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:53,300
and yeah the idea is that we are storing

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:57,580
there's on information that is important

00:15:53,300 --> 00:16:02,540
for the user like the keys for the email

00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:05,360
client or things like that we are using

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:09,850
the DM create for that and we are using

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,560
the for the file system X X for X for Y

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:17,420
and then the balcony diplomat in in life

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:22,570
boot and the the GUI part day or the

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:32,390
the tool is written in per is using GT

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:34,010
dedicated a3 at the moment so even if we

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:38,780
are running a live distribution and in

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:41,060
when it is running from the USB stick we

00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,480
would like to provide incremental

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:47,180
upgrades so when there are security days

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,280
or even features upgrades that we want

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:53,720
to provide to the user it is possible

00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,580
for he know for her to do it

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,270
there is you can see in the league there

00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:01,270
is a design document for that yeah again

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:06,140
only possible when the user is in the

00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:09,860
USB stick we are using a an incremental

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:14,270
great quit and when we try to resolve

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:17,780
like the overlap in file system stuff we

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:25,010
are using a squash FS stuck in effort to

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:27,140
resolve this these grades so we this is

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:31,340
maybe one of the areas that we need to

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:35,470
work more in is the in the application

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:39,580
issue isolation for the moment we choose

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:42,020
up-armored which is like the most

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,680
maintaining and the they were supported

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:49,120
in in debian but for the moment we are

00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:52,100
only supporting file access isolation

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,280
because there are some patches that we

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,920
need and they are not yet there in the

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,970
kernel

00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:06,350
we have to make like some cox-2 to make

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:10,580
it work with with a la distribution for

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:12,260
the moment we are a I provide an

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,360
isolation with our armored port for

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,970
several tools entails for example the

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:22,040
turbocell which may be toward the turbo

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:25,520
sorento we will have the biggest surface

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:29,060
of attack we really tried to uncle work

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,680
protecting only in this moment for the

00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,590
file access but also

00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:43,710
probably providing a isolation for 4pg

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:47,070
in bins Totten battalion others so for

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:50,100
the will and the test system we have

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,340
this the report that you can access in

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:56,610
in in Toledo take take a look for

00:18:53,340 --> 00:19:01,760
welding test we are using vagrant we

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:06,090
have now a automated ultimate it and

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:10,410
wilt and and tests which they the user

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:13,980
can can do in their own computer but we

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:17,010
we also have these salute servers in our

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:20,220
infrastructure that we are using to to

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:24,020
make it automatically because we every

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:30,060
time more and more we have more often

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:33,060
release of new person so we have to do

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:37,260
it in an automatic way for that we are

00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:41,220
using several tools for example securely

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:44,100
Libyan cucumber and you you want to see

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,320
this working don't miss the the demo the

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:56,640
next right that Friday that intra Greece

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:58,020
is going to show so a for well hi we

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,260
have explained we have several

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:04,620
challenges especially this thing of

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,590
kalin-san popularity because yeah this

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:12,260
last year we maybe have reached like the

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:17,610
pipe for several reasons we're a media

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:23,430
news or things like that so now we are

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:26,400
trying to release it every six weeks so

00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:30,360
is really a lot of work for for the for

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,180
the people that that we have and we are

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,980
not having like four thousand fourteen

00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:42,200
thousand boots every day which is almost

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:45,660
three times more than two years ago and

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:49,559
of course for this task and

00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,900
yeah yeah maintaining a operation system

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:55,920
is something which requires a lot of

00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:58,800
work so we have limited resources and

00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,950
tine and yeah we have a really small

00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,700
team compared with the amount of work we

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:11,370
have to do to make for example if we

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:14,190
have don't like 3500 commits but more

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,250
than 15 people in Lux the last six

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:21,510
months just a lot really a lot of work

00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:28,490
and yeah we need more people working

00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:28,490
with us so yeah that's it from my side

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,900
so I'm going to talk a bit about what

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:46,200
you are going to do in the next two

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,360
years this is a great fresh road map we

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,870
had a previous one for the last two

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:55,860
years that we mostly completed so month

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:59,220
last month a bunch of taste contributors

00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:01,410
met for a week and we had a look and try

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,470
to see what was most important for us to

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,780
do in the next year's so first of all we

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:11,460
want to complete the part of taste

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:18,900
didn't Jessie of course the ETA accompli

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:21,840
is early 19 6:20 2016 as always it's

00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,540
been almost down for Mountain months but

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,160
between almost down and ready to ship in

00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:30,570
production for actual users there are

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:33,780
sometimes a little bit of difference we

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:37,770
have quite a few ambitions in terms of

00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:42,900
hardening that is we want to protect our

00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:45,300
users better against attacks be them

00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,040
targeted on targeted the thing is the

00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,800
more tales is being used by actual

00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,650
people the more it gets popular the more

00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:56,100
it gets known and in the other media

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:58,680
spotlight spotlight and also the more it

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,710
gets high-profile users

00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,480
let's put it this way then the more it

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:07,800
becomes an interesting target for

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:10,980
whoever would like to cause trouble to

00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,950
the people who are using tails so it's

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:18,030
getting more and more important for us

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm not going to go through every every

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:23,100
line on this line just will you go for

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,440
it quickly and give you overview of the

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:31,620
main fields and topics we won't work on

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:35,100
we have already a quite international

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:37,140
audience which is good the custom

00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,320
software and strings with shipping tails

00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:43,440
is already translated like in 20 15 20

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,870
languages which is very good but for in

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,059
some situations it's not so good because

00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:52,380
for example if your internet connection

00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:55,920
is being censored or if you have if you

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:58,290
live in a place like England some places

00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,250
in England or Germany or other countries

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:03,809
where you cannot easily access store

00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:07,200
then you have to use pluggable

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:09,179
transports or top bridges to be able to

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,480
connect to tor and Fon now for example

00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:14,460
you have to enter this information the

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,510
configuration each time you start tales

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:20,280
which is clearly a pain yes so this we

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:23,340
want to allow users to save this

00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,780
configuration in a personal manner so

00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:31,620
they don't have to enter it each time

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:34,830
similarly we our website is the dark

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,830
corner right now our localization

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:40,800
efforts because it's only transmitted

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:44,250
translated in four languages including

00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,550
English which is not much and clearly

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:51,150
not enough and for to solve this problem

00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:53,850
we are in the process of setting up web

00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,460
tools to make it easier for our

00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,710
translators contribute as opposed to the

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,280
current way of translating our website

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:05,040
which is base and gates and gate is not

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:08,660
the most user-friendly tool for

00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,660
potential translators

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:17,130
as said previously one of our main

00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:19,610
focuses is to make tiles usable for as

00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:22,890
many people as possible

00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:26,160
it's we're already doing a quite good

00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,960
job at that but there are still some

00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,770
what they with the user experience

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:38,400
people call pain points that is even if

00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:40,500
the process is mostly easy it's enough

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,780
that you have one pain point to block

00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,000
someone and if they are blocked they can

00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,580
go further so even if the next steps

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,010
would be easy in the end they won't be

00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:54,330
able to use days so we are working with

00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:58,230
user experience experts and that Zack

00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:00,900
put us in touch with thanks a lot and to

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:05,160
identify these pain points and working

00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,500
it and design new and better ways of

00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,740
getting started started with tales

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,810
mainly because currently that's maintain

00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,820
point people just don't manage to

00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:21,810
install it at in the first place quite

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:24,450
often too often our user support team

00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:28,500
also has plans to make their life easier

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:32,130
and as a consequence to improve the

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:36,750
quality of how they deal with user

00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:38,700
requests this implies some work on the

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,100
infrastructure side this also implies

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,630
some software development work because

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,200
we are shipping a tool called whisper

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:51,120
back which is basically it's something

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:53,940
like Rapada it gathers some new lugs it

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,470
gives the user a template to fill in

00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,810
some information what they were trying

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,270
to do what they were expecting to see

00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:03,360
and what happened instead and then it

00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:06,750
sends this as an encrypted email to our

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:10,310
user support team that's a little bit of

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,310
software development to be done there

00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:17,010
last month when we had a look at the

00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:21,570
current state of things what days look

00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:22,410
like these days we had to make some kind

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,650
of

00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:29,309
hard choice that is we could either

00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:31,950
decide smallest feature fool and work on

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:35,010
polishing it making it more solid more

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,840
reliable we could go into adding more

00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,289
and more and more features and trying to

00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,530
address more and more and more use cases

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:46,169
we decided to not go after a future

00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:52,200
bloat we decided to feature to focus and

00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:55,020
our current design goals and so we

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,049
listed a few things we want to do that

00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:03,320
we categorize as polishing making the

00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:09,870
whole thing a bit I don't know

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:12,120
perfect in the last two years one our

00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:15,240
main focus was improving the project

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,760
sustainability because of course it's no

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,919
use of making a very good tool if it

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,130
dies in two years so we've put a lot of

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,500
effort into writing automated tests

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:29,220
improving our processes doing outreach

00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,260
drawing the team and so on and so on and

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,360
we still have a bit of work to do in

00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:38,250
this area even even if it's nuts

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:44,220
our main focus anymore and when within

00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:47,370
this section we would like to improve

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,590
it's the way we deal with money that is

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,320
we would like to depend a bit less and

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:57,090
government grants yes we get money we

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,480
use money we spend money and help with

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,770
these circles from government grants

00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,130
this is something we are not totally

00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:07,950
satisfied with and would like to change

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:10,020
and probably it will be an incremental

00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:14,460
change probably it will take time so

00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:18,030
better start early and this would also

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,220
allow us me likely to have more reliable

00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:23,580
and steady sources sources of income

00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:28,200
that is not depending on whether you'll

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:32,070
get the next big grant on that that's

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,660
all for what our plans for next two

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:40,850
years if you want details we have

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:42,680
more detailed document with this with

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:44,870
all the information I've put that

00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,290
include links to the actual tickets in

00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,510
our test tracker and you can of course

00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:57,640
ask as details if you're interested in

00:29:50,510 --> 00:30:01,100
any specific part of it needless to say

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,720
we might not be able to do all that with

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:07,130
the current team in the next two years

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:11,810
and it could be useful if more people

00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:13,880
came to help us now speaking about that

00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:19,130
ad that comp puts me in kind of an

00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:22,880
awkward place I mean I would not feel

00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:25,010
comfortable asking people to work on

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,500
tails if it implies they will put less

00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,780
time into Debian that not what I'm

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,810
asking

00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:35,660
so maybe for most people in the room you

00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:38,360
actually won't be able to contribute ace

00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,960
even if you would like very much which

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:45,680
I'm sure because it would imply you do

00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,300
less in Debian if if debian isn't in a

00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,250
worse position taste in the worst

00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:53,320
position test users are in the worst

00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,320
position and the world is a worse place

00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:02,210
but maybe you know poor or good

00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,920
conferences or whatever you might be

00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,960
interested the night at sparetime or

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,000
might want to switch from the crappy

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,140
project of something they are working in

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,870
and do something else so I'm going to

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:20,140
list the kind of skills we currently

00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:20,140
need most that is basically everything

00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,650
to be honest for the software

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:31,100
development part we are quite well

00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:34,970
staffed as many free software projects

00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,590
that the the getting software developers

00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,230
on board is probably the easiest thing

00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,790
to do because the people create the

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,620
project assets who are developers they

00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:46,930
know how to talk to such whatever files

00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:50,180
and so on so the skills we need most

00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:51,770
less different skills that may be

00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,750
technical or maybe nuts that may be

00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:57,980
social net that may be creative or not

00:31:53,750 --> 00:32:00,860
and here's the rest we have pretty good

00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,440
the contributors documentation that

00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:07,610
allows people to find tasks that could

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,790
achieve given their existing skills or

00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:13,490
the things they would like to learn they

00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:15,280
are sitting there and going to wrap it

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,830
because we hadn't have much time left

00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:23,090
with some contact information so this

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:25,430
always very fast and if you have more

00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,470
questions or whatever you can talk to us

00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:30,080
because we're here and some of us will

00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:33,620
be here for the entire that comes and

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:36,470
some more will join us in two days and

00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:40,400
of course we have the usual set of

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:43,400
mailing lists IRC website etc etc extra

00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,580
and slides are only ready online thank

00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,580
you

00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:04,290
so thank you for your work on tails it's

00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,250
something that we use critically hi

00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:09,010
thank you for your work on tails is

00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:11,380
something that that folks that I work

00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,940
with rely on heavily we would not be

00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,470
able to do our work without it so that's

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,870
much appreciated

00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:20,290
I saw you said people who contribute to

00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:22,440
Debian maybe can't help because you

00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:25,290
don't want to divert work from Debian

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,610
what are ways that Debian can help tails

00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:29,730
what what can we do as an operating

00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:43,390
system to make the work for on tails

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:46,840
better easier more effective okay so mmm

00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:49,510
I actually gave a talk explicitly on

00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,880
this topic at the minitek Infinium a few

00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:54,690
months ago which was called how you can

00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,310
compute tails by contributing to Debian

00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:59,770
you might want to refer the slides for

00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:02,590
details but in short they we have lists

00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:06,340
of packages we rely a lot on and that's

00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:09,930
need more hands be it basic building

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:12,760
bricks of course like the kernel xorg

00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:14,440
tough teams that are understaffed and

00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,670
have a hard time dealing with all the

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,960
work they have to do like the genome

00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:22,090
team for example we also have a lot of

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,330
work we do the fact porting work we do

00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:27,640
because when you implement stuff a trim

00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,750
first as it's been explained already you

00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,090
have to wait for it to learn through

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,810
Debian and maybe wait two more years so

00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:36,400
we ship a lot of backdoors so we

00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,680
maintain a lot of back parts and we

00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:42,100
would not mind some help in that so we

00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:46,660
can focus on stuff that's more tail

00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:50,260
centric and less Debian centric and you

00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:53,080
know so if you're interested in doing

00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:55,420
some of this you can talk to me in the

00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:59,490
in the next few days I'd be happy to

00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:59,490
point you to other things

00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:08,329
one short question you said you know

00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:11,270
about the daily users of the system how

00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:14,410
would you measure that without sending

00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:17,690
information through a public network

00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:19,520
disturbing the privacy of the user so

00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:26,200
that's the question we have every time

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:31,609
we give a talk ok so since using

00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:33,650
outdated system is really unsafe so we

00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:37,520
really want to make sure that the users

00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:40,730
have the up-to-date version for that at

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:45,559
each boot when you boot tears it checks

00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:48,170
if there are upgrades and we so the

00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:53,420
statistics we have as a number of people

00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:55,160
that check for upgrades and no it

00:35:53,420 --> 00:36:01,640
doesn't reveal information about the

00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:04,400
user it rests yeah so the check goes

00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,309
foot tall and so it's like any

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:13,220
connection to any other website you

00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:15,650
would do and so we only know one tales

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,170
has booted and we don't know whether

00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:21,109
what they are doing or anything we just

00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:24,190
know the boots so check for updates and

00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:24,190
that's it

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:44,839
I know I know dkg already said that but

00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,700
I just wanted to thank you York is

00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:48,559
really really important and it helps a

00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,130
lot of people and I just wanted to

00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:51,130
acknowledge that

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,880
hi does it ever occur that in a new

00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:20,830
version of software there are new

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,359
features and some of those features fall

00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,300
in home because there was an incident

00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:27,520
recently the chromium browser would call

00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,170
home to Google in a new version that was

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,060
pushed as a stable security update and

00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:36,670
it would phone home to Google request

00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:39,670
some executive or software for which

00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,349
there was no source code fortunately in

00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:43,840
Debian I didn't run this but that was a

00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:46,780
close call I wonder and can this be

00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,760
detected easily with automated tools or

00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:52,540
does it involve like a manual source

00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,790
code audited to check that there's

00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,250
nothing you'd like this added in a new

00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:59,320
version of a piece of software do you

00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:04,270
mean they specifically or mine general

00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:07,960
and with Intel's do you have tools to

00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:12,580
you know detect packages falling home we

00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:15,010
don't wish the thing is we should

00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:19,000
proactively few software that talks to

00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:23,320
network and these ones we configure

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,210
quite carefully and accept the top

00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,130
browser basically then we get updated

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:31,089
when every two years when we switch to

00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:35,230
the next version of Debian so the risks

00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:37,240
are relatively low the main potential

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:40,089
offender would be the web browser of

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:43,150
course but for all this one we are just

00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:53,230
relying and the tremendous work done by

00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:56,109
the top result team okay okay question I

00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:58,240
think maybe I should add tails

00:38:56,109 --> 00:39:01,920
configured in a way when even if it was

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:05,470
phoning home except if it was actively

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,320
looking for user specific information in

00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:11,980
their configuration cache files history

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,589
something basically all these users

00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,050
would be looking the same to their

00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:19,490
online server that would be reporting

00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:23,240
back so the risk is not that

00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:24,680
hey well they're phoning home risk with

00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,140
summer limited definition of running

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:31,460
home is quite slow in tears or almost an

00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:34,160
existing anything more deeper with I

00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:37,490
would call malware instead of phoning

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,940
home or privacy week and that's a

00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,940
different topic

00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:55,829
well it looks like everybody has their

00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:59,279
questions and so so thank you for being

00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:02,670
here and let's hope we talk to you in

00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:05,180
the next days and things for your work

00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,180
