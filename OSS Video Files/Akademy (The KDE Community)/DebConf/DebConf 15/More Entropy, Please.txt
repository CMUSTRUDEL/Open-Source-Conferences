In this talk, I will discuss Monty Hall problem by its computer simulation and will show how Random Bit Generator is important, and more entropy is needed.

In Debconf 14, I listend the talk by Tom Marble, which was titled "Security not by chance: the AltusMetrum hardware true random number generator".

It was very impressive for me.  (I had a TRNG implementation of mine, but I didn't recognize its importance.)

Since then, I have been considering some promotion for more entropy, and l wrote the article (see the first URL).

The story doesn't directly discuss TRNG itself, but it explains that bias should be killed and it discuss an effective side channel attack, and it emphasizes more entropy is required.
