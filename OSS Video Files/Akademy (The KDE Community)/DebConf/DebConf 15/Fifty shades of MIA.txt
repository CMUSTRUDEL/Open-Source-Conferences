so the next chalk is 50 shades of m.i.a

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,109
by Caro Munez Thanks

00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:20,039
we're going to present something about

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:25,080
mi M which is something we do debian to

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:30,240
make debian better also we want to me to

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:34,829
you what am i is mi means machine

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,780
interaction you know when going come to

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,120
them Ian people usually comes and makes

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,910
a lot of noise and want to a lot of

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,059
things and that's good but sometime life

00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,980
gets in the middle and people goes and

00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:55,260
no anyway anything all of them they

00:00:49,980 --> 00:01:01,309
leave they didn't say our so we have to

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:07,409
find them and try to ask them what to do

00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:16,140
what I want to packages and so on so is

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:20,700
the the mission of the mi a-- team why

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:24,479
do we care about that stuff but because

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,400
many all of this engine in package is

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,909
being rotten and being maintained it

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:37,280
peoples has to miss have some religious

00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:40,560
bags get an answer even FC bags

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:46,890
especially on release time and testing

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,780
first people even send fixes to the to

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,259
the bags but they don't get a player no

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,659
no new applause hard on and of course

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:59,100
this means the quality of the cough

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,770
drops I also think the I personally

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,890
think it's also kind of breaking a

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,020
seconded because it looks like we are

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,540
doing carrying about the users of our

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:15,860
packages so it's kind of

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:18,950
so because there are people behind that

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,319
packages and we Carol will have before I

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:28,510
like people to disappear with a reason

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:28,510
and to miss that people we already know

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:37,269
why do you care well it is a gang we

00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:37,269
care too but I have to change the title

00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:48,709
content package are not a good idea to

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:51,549
have packages rotten and wife it's much

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:57,379
better or also we think their opinions

00:02:51,549 --> 00:03:01,430
to have the orphanage the team to take

00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:05,060
care of them this is no problem if you

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:08,560
don't can not want a package let's let

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:11,060
it go if you loved it let it go

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,489
interesting packages will be adopted and

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,549
I know and the ones know what I want

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:19,549
will be missed or we don't be missing in

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:25,400
fact and this is less war for the rest

00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:28,069
of us of course we don't have any amount

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,500
Anand you don't like it doesn't mean is

00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:39,019
the package isn't I mean we're not in

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:42,739
that business okay well this is a brief

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:47,060
percentage of the teen who had Mei team

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:49,310
well everybody is MIT we were reports

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:54,700
with everybody from the missing people

00:03:49,310 --> 00:04:00,049
and QA is everybody on Damien so

00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:03,430
everybody is mi currently only arrange

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:06,889
specularly doing work on the first row I

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:09,859
might say about myself hanging in back

00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:14,349
in vacation mode this year so I'm really

00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,349
doing much thing so we need you

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,580
we used to join well we have thinking

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,820
about improving the process so if you

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,820
want

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:31,759
something you can join if you want there

00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:34,039
in quality you can also join if you like

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:43,879
today with people the just people you

00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:47,870
may know the other one current tools

00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:50,449
have some wet hated come online tool set

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,069
you can see some well there is more

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:58,900
comments than that and you can see some

00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:58,900
the typical workflow is using Mia query

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:06,800
am i to do to see what needs to be done

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:12,680
so it's just least what it's spending on

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:17,060
today's tools also have to to send the

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,150
mains and and to keep things more or

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:28,370
less saying it's so more tight mad but

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:33,379
you can use other - more on current

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:38,810
process uses a system of tags three

00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:41,680
levels there's a little mix of what our

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:46,339
stud and there are implemented all of

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:52,039
stacks and they what difference between

00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:57,229
status level of approach is doing nice

00:05:52,039 --> 00:06:00,520
is she or he has been worn once to is

00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:05,839
the last one we are one saying and also

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:08,409
directional which is helps to keep more

00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:12,649
or less the flow it's not very nice but

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:18,460
somewhat worse you have to prepare

00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:18,460
manually demands and I remember too busy

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:27,560
it's very prone to error and I think

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:32,870
everybody in the team has forgot some

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:35,319
the tie some time and you have to redo

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,319
the scenes

00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:43,050
so we want to try and change that a bit

00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:47,129
we're going to make it simple and we

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:51,509
went to make it better make her process

00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:56,699
more direct because right now there is a

00:06:51,509 --> 00:07:00,930
little confusion what to do

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:05,520
someone else depends on the answer makes

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:10,490
make is very complicated and we think it

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:15,810
should be simpler we have thought about

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:18,120
three miners just which is really more

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:27,169
or less but you don't know it more

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:27,169
explicit having time each reminder and

00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:34,379
if first of all create our up with

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,409
implement a lot of feature which had

00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:40,740
machine in a common line in a common

00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:44,969
line comment while reporting so we see

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,159
people easily can somebody I think

00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:51,089
that's me and that package or whatever

00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:53,219
and automatic report the feedback which

00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:57,839
is other federal you have to do by hand

00:07:53,219 --> 00:08:00,300
now support for teams of people working

00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,900
a passage which is totally missing now

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:08,550
there is no you have to be in usually

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:11,009
everybody and so on in fact when you do

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:14,819
so the system gets a little confused

00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:18,949
because things there is in the blockades

00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:24,029
and serve it eternal comments which is

00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:27,449
something terrible sometimes to not feel

00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:30,659
next member of these people has that

00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:35,219
problem which doesn't necessarily need

00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:38,940
to be public or send in the mail and of

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:41,250
course trying to keep backward

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,449
compatibility this is not as strong

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,760
future because we understand to make it

00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:50,240
better it's probably we need

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:53,900
to break something well at least it

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:58,690
could be this decide to the new system

00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:01,610
to keep update in the mail database and

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:10,010
make it riddle for the command-line

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:14,030
tools at least this is keen the footer

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:17,530
flog which is very even if it looks

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:20,660
complicated it's not is more simple you

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,430
get to receive this is the first part

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,280
it's ok you receive some be some what it

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,730
tells you somebody's me it's in the

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,310
first reminder circular manner further

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:35,270
money and that finally is the the what

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:37,910
which is in the part of Nemea process

00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:43,150
but it's not done by the minute King or

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:45,500
not directly by us there's somebody else

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:50,960
because you have to remove that

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:54,910
from the from the lab and checking is is

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:58,880
how the same asks ever you have to check

00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:01,910
time you have time for them and you have

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,240
too much workload half-interest have you

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:07,400
motivated to work in packages and you

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,910
have problems with people because

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:16,150
sometimes there's internal affairs and

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:23,810
things we make people go away and

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:27,980
anything mm-hmm with I wanted to mean my

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:30,530
LD life hat was outside Debian probably

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:37,910
you know real life can be affecting your

00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:40,850
Debian experience and of course or final

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:46,760
it's orphan the packages if you have fun

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:50,780
want to have less workload I'll retire

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:53,770
return is good you can retire we can

00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:57,350
come back later when you have more time

00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:00,110
so to summarize

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:04,120
the process helps their an even if you

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:08,510
don't think so these people is better

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,370
people work less and we need help

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:16,510
because who are you wearing

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:22,000
getting started I need better tools so

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:22,000
thanks for listening and join me at him

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:43,310
if you have some questions or hello

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:47,150
do you think we need to fix something in

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:52,130
the Debian workflow itself so people get

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:56,260
less m.i.a or do we need more non

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:59,240
maintainer uploads easier hi tricks well

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,930
what are you I guess there it can't

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:08,780
hurts but you can't help but does not

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:13,550
really help to get people less am i

00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:17,780
because you know people can disappear if

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:22,970
you have a better QA process in the

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:26,570
sense of easing and I mean use or become

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:30,490
improve packages but people who are

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:34,130
purse Mantine in them is still missing

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:37,010
it's a kind of hiding a bit and there

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,750
are real the real stat of the package

00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:44,740
this package has known my entire you are

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,740
so it should be orphan

00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:58,339
related to that related to that last

00:12:54,589 --> 00:13:05,080
year there's been a Def Con last year

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:07,239
has been about salvaging packages

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,069
[Music]

00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:13,129
looks and maintained and some of the

00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:15,769
stars and mu-1 mu-2 and mu-3

00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:19,759
saying that it's actually acceptable at

00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:23,029
some point to upload like 15 days

00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:26,989
delayed and mu whatever that changes the

00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:31,639
maintained airfield yeah that I think is

00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:47,449
a good idea that kind of tracking a kind

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:49,420
of express process also helps when a

00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:51,679
maintainer is still active but

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,850
unresponsive on some packages because

00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:59,259
maybe they lost interest

00:13:52,850 --> 00:14:02,059
yeah the problem in maintenance we have

00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,249
forgot about some packets but they are

00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:09,319
still active with others and don't want

00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:12,739
to see some package and I still think

00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:15,470
that even if you manage to salvage the

00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:17,869
package itself mmm is not a good idea to

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,509
have a account laying around

00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:26,299
yeah with no people dancing so it's like

00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:28,730
completely I just want to say I'm quite

00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,290
fine with the current tools the only

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:34,209
thing I was missing when I was doing

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:37,850
some iam work was the documentation yeah

00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:40,399
fault this is because there is

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,529
documentation but the main issue I

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,649
remember is that it's scattered over

00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:47,689
several places and there's no place

00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:50,419
where you find all of it so for example

00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:53,149
the meaning and how to work with the

00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:55,720
tags is I think in the readme in this

00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:59,440
SVN while

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,630
the procedure with went what is in the

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,820
wiki that's the kind of confusion I was

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,250
talking about there is something said

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:11,040
but not all and it's like an arcane

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:13,600
process you have to master somehow by

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,830
learning my example yeah yeah so I'm

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,860
glad to see a kind of workflow here and

00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:24,220
well I hope that there will be better

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:31,720
documentation in the future so maybe

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:35,320
more people can help without needing to

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:40,350
learn too much things from asking run

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:44,860
IRC also I think having better tools is

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:48,220
the why - because you can build

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:53,200
something you can build in a right way

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:55,540
having it documented with her hello my

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,150
question is rather asking a feedback

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:02,620
from the audience not just a question -

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:04,870
the missing in action team the process

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,850
starts with sending an email the missing

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,580
in action team saying that this

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:13,450
developer went away a long time ago on

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:17,200
and we don't know anything about it

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:20,560
so my proposal to the Mia team a year

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,560
back was sending a reminder

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,980
automatically to every developer who

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,730
hasn't been seen for a half year for

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:33,190
example kind reminder that hey we

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,110
remember you there you did some work and

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:40,120
thank you and you want to come back or

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:43,600
not and it could trigger the Mia process

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,370
faster and he or she may not be as Mia

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:53,740
as he or she would be after a year or so

00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:59,650
I want to answer because that has been

00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:02,530
already scattered hi the the process

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,630
doesn't stop with the Mia team Melinda

00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,100
maintainer the processes start with

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,699
somebody million

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,199
lately and if this person doesn't get a

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,470
communication with the maintainer they

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,110
mail in the Mia TM Lamia Tamia team and

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,600
the second thing is automatic ping is

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:21,250
never going to work because we have

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,289
plenty of people in the arena who are

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,539
active in something else I maintain in

00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:27,699
packages plenty or some people are maybe

00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:29,980
maintaining two three packages that

00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:38,080
don't change so they have no reason

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:40,530
fruit that in your packages you can have

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,270
somebody who is IDP master in the VM

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,760
this person on cheese mine to me three

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,039
packages those packages don't change

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,620
don't need any update so what's the

00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:51,610
point of sending an automatic email

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,970
usually when you send this kind of

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:57,429
automatic emails Jimmy to handle the

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:05,320
replace and you get plenty of angry

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:07,809
rupees in the missing in action themes

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,470
infrastructure there is a tool for

00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:14,530
querying the activity of people and it

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:17,620
shows mailing list activity as well so

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:20,530
if someone is active as an FTP master he

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:24,309
would send out a lot of emails so he

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,590
wouldn't be seen as inactive yeah but

00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:29,260
there is other activities which doesn't

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:33,340
leave trace on the underground world so

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:38,020
you can be making teams or whatever

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:45,880
without mailing lists or mailing lists

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:52,179
which are not so you can be doing things

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:55,809
without leaving our kind of traces maybe

00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:57,490
maybe they ft / master was you know the

00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:00,780
better example but it's an example of

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:03,789
people which can do things without

00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,600
necessarily making packages there's a

00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:12,400
lot of things more on Debian packages

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:14,789
that would be two emails per year that's

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,789
a lot for

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:27,230
months or you mean to measure package no

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:32,159
no my people handling the ray please

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:35,130
please use the micro right so just a

00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,330
question for me a commit strict like if

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,700
somebody commits something to get a

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:44,690
subversion on subversion up in oak

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,690
that's track for MI or not well if you

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:04,049
think there is um when you became

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:08,730
maintainer you have to send a ping to a

00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:10,799
package and people should be doing that

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:20,010
I think if they have no other activity

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:22,409
am I wrong and my when we introduced the

00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,270
VM maintainer a status somebody pooped

00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:26,159
something I don't know if he's in the

00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,990
official documentation or not about the

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,350
digamma internet having to do an annual

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,419
ping opening about rapport I have seen

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:40,980
some people doing that but it's actually

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:43,830
somebody looking at that I have never

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,990
ever ever seen a request for a key

00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:49,260
removal based on someone not sending an

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,880
annual pain to the devoman tanners and

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,470
as someone who gets those emails by

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,149
being on the bug alias I do absolutely

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,580
nothing with them and I don't think they

00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:58,919
serve any useful purpose I think there's

00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,200
a potential for tying a bunch of

00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,850
information into m dot debian org that

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,049
ties with the debian contributors which

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,669
will tell you how recently someone's

00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:07,799
been active on potentially moving the

00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:10,770
maintainer thing as a button in there

00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:12,240
but I don't think anyone's doing cleanup

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,950
B is still not paying or not and I don't

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:23,029
think it serves any useful purpose of

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:26,270
President just go back to his comments I

00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,270
understand that

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:33,560
no one is doing it but I also agree that

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:37,010
if if the if someone is not visible it's

00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,990
also a problem like there are even there

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:43,250
are contributors that are not packages

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:46,490
but we somehow can trace them like wiki

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:49,460
editors already show on contributors

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,200
that they're in the dark or we if

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,320
someone receives this kind of message

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,940
and it he or she is active somehow and

00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,410
we don't know we just apologize and

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:05,270
maybe we should be tracking these

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:07,220
activity somehow so we're mostly running

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:12,080
out of time is there any urgent further

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:16,790
comments or questions I guess with

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:22,760
regards to the M the only thing that

00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:28,370
taken over there's no I mean they're

00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:29,990
having an inactivity M so there could be

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,210
a the only difference between an active

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,480
enemy and inactive DM is that new

00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:37,880
versions don't get packaged but there

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:44,630
could be an active DM that has an

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:46,910
upstream that is not making and it's not

00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:50,950
contributing to compute the quorum for

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:53,210
elections for example where the count of

00:22:50,950 --> 00:23:00,980
so I think that could just work

00:22:53,210 --> 00:23:03,980
salvaging packages okay so there's one

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,780
fruit okay now maybe it's best to

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,160
continue to conduct conversation

00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,210
afterwards outside yeah yeah because

00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,330
we're running thanks everybody the place

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,330
thank you

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,179
