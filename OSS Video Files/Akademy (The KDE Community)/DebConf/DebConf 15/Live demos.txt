	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
good afternoon everybody welcome to the

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,160
first lightning talks sorry live demo

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,920
session at Def Con 15 we've got three

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,130
marvelous speakers giving four demos yes

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,730
four for the price of three and first up

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,380
is as clipping a bit I think first up is

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:29,490
Mario Lange talking to us about the

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:32,219
Braille music compiler hi everyone this

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,050
is probably a bit of an unusual demo

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,719
because it is not relative and related

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,649
it's just showing what I have been doing

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:46,320
in the last several years if I were not

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:52,230
working on Debian I'm a musician and I'm

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,129
blind so I came across music notation at

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,550
some point in my life

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:59,489
and I realized that a thing rather hard

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,340
to deal with because music notation is

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,080
inherently two-dimensional so it's not

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,020
something that you can easily describe

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,810
in text and if you describe it in just

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,400
normal text then it gets rather

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,590
long-winded and you probably it's just

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,119
too much so there's a special code

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,049
actually it's called Braille music

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:25,100
notation was invented roughly 100 years

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:30,810
ago by the inventor of Braille actually

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:35,130
which is rather compact rather compact

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,259
representation of music notation in just

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,880
bradle thoughts it uses the six dot

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:45,329
Braille system yeah so the point is

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,939
there is actually no free software for

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,840
this that one or two very very

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,149
incomplete implementation surround so I

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,210
decided to do something about this and

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,890
write software about it first

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,380
implementation was something to convert

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,030
music XML to Braille music was

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,060
interesting but it was kind of a

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,239
prototype so I found my dance and

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,810
realized I have to start again so the

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,860
current project I'm working on is called

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,350
PMC the brain

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,870
music compiler because I decided to do

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:22,020
the more complicated direction first

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:27,080
which which is to parse Braille music

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:31,020
and produce some data structure from it

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:34,920
yeah that's basically the idea and the

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,130
other idea is to make this software help

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,170
you in many many ways one thing is when

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,520
I learned to read Braille music I was

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,440
not able to like know if I really were

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,420
interpreting it correctly so I always

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,200
wanted some software that could play the

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,370
sounds to me

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,380
that's one big goal and the other big

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,920
goal is to make it easier for sighted

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:05,209
and playing people to cooperate on music

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:11,040
so what PMC is currently doing is it

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:13,890
reads Braille in music notation parses

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,890
it and then it can actually generate

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:21,180
Lily poem to music XML from that so that

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,890
you can enter music notation in in from

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,640
the perspective of a blind person in

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:29,340
your native format and have it presented

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,549
to some sighted person who has no idea

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,640
about Braille music notation a current

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:39,390
idea is basically it parses this rather

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,790
complicated code it generates lily pond

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:45,570
of it and lily pond does the rest of the

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:50,010
work so you generate SVG output and MIDI

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,590
and whatnot and now that I'm actually at

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,560
a point where the backend is useful and

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,519
doing some things we actually started to

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,600
create a GUI this user interface is

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,220
about four months or so it's really just

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,670
experimenting around it's the first

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:12,420
first time we started first time I and

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:15,239
actually we worked with cute cute so

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,950
it's a rather new thing but I think we

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:21,290
have made some nice progress in that I

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,290
just wanted to show this off actually

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:35,670
you know if it's a former beside you so

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:37,620
what this software can do is actually

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,890
translate these automatically to a

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:51,270
visual representation thanks to lady

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:54,900
pond actually and and the backend system

00:04:51,270 --> 00:05:01,770
actually knows about musical objects

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:06,450
from both representations so you can

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:08,850
like hover over a visual note and have

00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,150
it highlighted in the actual Braille

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,940
music code you you can also click on a

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,710
visual note so that editing cursor in

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,230
the Braille music editor window is

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:24,000
positioned this is just to facilitate

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:26,460
working together between plant inside

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,710
the paper because if you're like I'm in

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,690
this note I mean this see down there you

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,990
can just point the mouse at it and kick

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,850
it and that is actually the same note

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,250
will be under the cursor for the plant

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:43,950
person you can also create your own

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,840
Braille music so this is just like one

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,330
of the exemplar files a ship if the

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,400
project something from Bach but you can

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,980
also and that's the idea if you can

00:05:50,400 --> 00:06:00,350
write Braille music yourself you can

00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:04,440
very easily input okay I would show this

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:06,930
just like the bright dots that Mario

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,330
sees on the Braille display and this is

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:13,530
the lower part is what the

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,660
representation is of the of the music if

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,530
I hover over this note and see like this

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:24,510
is a G and I see the highlighted area is

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:29,850
actually three characters and so you see

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:33,270
like for this 8g you'll need three

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,160
characters to represent to represent it

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,590
gets even funnier for example for this

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,430
you have like achieve with a slur to the

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,090
next

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,290
it is called there are also three

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,060
characters but completely different and

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,310
just to show you and give you a feel how

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,440
like complicated this is for even the

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:56,820
sighted people just like a mode where

00:06:49,440 --> 00:07:00,510
you can use show this without using

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:07,470
prime notation and it it looks then like

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:10,410
this the idea if I like in yeah now I

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,360
can also compile it like yeah the idea

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,240
here is that that Braille actually

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,280
always represents something so the

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,160
encoding for normal text it's just

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,590
Braille dots and it's a Braille user you

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,950
know the representation by heart so you

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,540
can actually enter Braille music by just

00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,540
using the normal computer keyboard

00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,670
mm-hmm so you see like this note

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,790
represents a J a comma a double quote in

00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:42,810
the sea great stuff and the fun thing is

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:47,520
you can like enter it's like it's the

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:50,730
only example I know and if I like render

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,830
this I get this and the funny thing is I

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:55,710
can like reformat this this is was

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,650
intentionally made for like if to reflow

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:02,520
or to like justify it and only display

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:07,470
for example 20 columns or more or less

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:10,650
and if I press reformat this code gets

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:13,560
converted in Perl notation to so so you

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,270
can actually see what what what it looks

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,220
like on a Braille display it's still a

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:22,440
nice it works yeah yeah that's the state

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,110
of things if anyone is interested in

00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,910
music free software and strange

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,620
accessibility technology I'm really

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,660
looking for people who might be willing

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,000
to contribute to this especially because

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,010
I'm rather new to cute if you have good

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,230
cute programmer and if you see like

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:43,799
things which could be done then just

00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:51,010
talk to me would be very nice thanks

00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:52,880
[Applause]

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:57,800
thank you very much

00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:04,160
next up o dkg Daniel con Gilmore and

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:16,880
Annabel demonstrating to us with a

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:33,260
sketch the key signing arrangement I

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:42,200
think it's working try speaking does it

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:43,550
work all right sounds good happy buddy

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:51,830
are you guys okay

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:53,360
okay great thanks so for the way the key

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:57,050
signing is working at this particular

00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,350
event we ask people to send their keys

00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:02,660
to any bow before the event started and

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,540
those keys were all put into a file and

00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,390
everyone has the same file you can fetch

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,770
the file from this URL here and below it

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:14,390
here is the sha-256 checksum of the file

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:18,110
so this file is a text file and it

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:22,010
contains people's keys and fingerprints

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,630
and user IDs and what we're gonna do is

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,220
we're going to show you how you can use

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,950
this throughout the rest of the

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,290
conference we've got what six days more

00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,940
of the conference you've got that's if

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,050
you meet ten people a day that'll be a

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,640
hundred and twenty people that you'll

00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:39,740
meet 20 people a day that's my math is

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,800
my math is slurring already in two days

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,350
in so we're just going to show you how

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,940
you can use this if you want to fetch

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,170
the file right now and take a look at it

00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,760
or if you've already fetched it you know

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:54,140
what it looks like basically it's just

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,700
got sort of the the the listing of key

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,650
with a fingerprint with a number next to

00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,290
it with some names on it so we're going

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,350
to do a little bit

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,089
raishin of what it's like to use to use

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,500
this mechanism to do your key signing

00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:07,199
throughout the week instead of at a

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,649
single particular event so okay ah

00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:13,050
hey how's it going Daniel I know you

00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:17,490
maintained the hello package and I have

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:21,209
a few packet a few patches hello super

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,920
buggy and I need all the help I can so I

00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:24,120
would love to work with you more on it

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,089
but I'd like to have a way that we can

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,800
communicate securely when we're when

00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:33,449
we've left the conference yeah we can

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:38,670
cross sign our case I guess I downloaded

00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:41,069
a they here and I checked the text I

00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,620
calculated a checksum everything is

00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:46,079
correct according to these and I also

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,449
checked my fingerprint and what about

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,540
you yeah so I fetched the file and I

00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:53,519
checked the sha-256 checks a fingerprint

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,800
of the file the checksum of the file and

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,329
it checked out I looked in the file and

00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,430
I saw that it had my name and my

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:03,180
fingerprint was correct and I'm number

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:05,510
62 in the file I number 22 and here's my

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,220
ID so you could check my

00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:11,160
government-issued ID

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:14,819
hmm my government-issued ID here you go

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,430
yeah so it says Annie ball one sauce

00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:20,190
Salazar wait a second is that okay and

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,980
you said you said your you said you

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:25,560
check the file too and you you check the

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,990
file on your fingerprints yes your what

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,420
number are you a number 22 and your

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,589
number I'm number 62 in the file all

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,810
right so I'm gonna write down a number

00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:45,660
62 number 22

00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:47,880
yep Anabel Salazar cool so I can use

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,130
this so I'm not gonna sign your key

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,959
right away but when I get home and I'm

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,730
doing my key signing I can find it in

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,630
the file and I can get your fingerprint

00:12:53,730 --> 00:13:00,990
from yeah I'll keep this no don't do

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,670
that all right thank you very much I'll

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,800
do the same and I'm going to thank keys

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,120
when I get back home okay great thank

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,279
you lot yeah look forward to working on

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,279
hello with you yep all right so

00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:17,379
does this make sense as to as to how

00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:18,699
that process can work what we we want to

00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,049
encourage you to meet people throughout

00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,129
the week and it can be a little bit

00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,929
awkward to meet people

00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:24,339
this gives you one one thing one way to

00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:25,869
meet two one thing to talk to people

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,249
about and then you can sure you can find

00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:28,989
other things that you're both interested

00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:33,159
in in Debian even if it's not the Hello

00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:36,909
package so so how much time do we have

00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:38,919
o clock Meister so we'll go ahead and

00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:44,319
and read this out here for the benefit

00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:48,599
of the spooling video it's for nine or

00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:49,989
eight echo alpha Foxtrot alpha zero

00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:52,329

thank you Delta Foxtrot echo seven

Foxtrot six eight three six zero echo

00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:28,449
Foxtrot so so I encourage you really to

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:33,129
meet people during the conference this

00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:42,099
is what we want to have happen I miss a

00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:43,689
sticker I recommend that you find the

00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:45,549
front desk that might have some masking

00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:47,259
tape and make your own sticker that says

00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:48,549
I would like to sign your key or you get

00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:49,779
a piece of paper and you could slip it

00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:53,079
in here there's all kinds of ways to

00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:55,629
hack the process but you should assume

00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,189
that if people are here at debconf they

00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,779
may not have had their key in this in

00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:00,789
this particular file so you can't use

00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:03,759
that mechanism they may have copies of

00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:05,409
their key on slips of paper and that's

00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,119
okay too this is another way to do it so

00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:08,199
we could have done this hey here you go

00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,819
and then we could have done the same

00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,339
exchange I've got mine written on the

00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:13,389
slip of paper too so there's a lot of

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:15,669
different ways that you can do the key

00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,319
exchange and I encourage you to do it as

00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,179
a way just to meet people by the way you

00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:21,220
can get somebody's finger print and not

00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,150
sign it you just know what their

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,620
fingerprint is you

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,180
sign it in a way that doesn't publish it

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,590
if you if you're embarrassed you can

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,090
also decide that you don't want to show

00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,560
your government-issued ID maybe you

00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,360
don't have government-issued ID and

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,770
that's okay too the worst thing that

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,300
happens is that somebody says well I'm

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,980
not comfortable signing it if I don't

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,300
see it and that's okay

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,560
they can't you can still give them a

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,970
copy of your fingerprint and say I'm

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,970
going to communicate with you about the

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,740
hello package and and then they'll know

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,710
who you are and you can exchange secure

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,930
messages in the future so so meet people

00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,370
get in touch understand what your common

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,930
points are in the Debian project and be

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,250
able to have a secure communication on

00:15:52,930 --> 00:16:04,480
the internet after you've left the

00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:07,750
conference thanks thank you very much

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,110
sorry for the phone notes the last

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:14,800
speaker doing two separate demos is on

00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:17,220
today's Surrey and he will tell us what

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,220
we're doing

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:40,520
this is some world machine so hello I'm

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:47,060
Andre and I'm kind of DNS geek if you

00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:48,980
know me so well I want to ask you while

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:53,150
few questions first do you have your own

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:58,520
domain name yes Roy's end and did you

00:16:53,150 --> 00:17:00,200
sign it with DNS SEC and why not well

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,590
usually because the NSTIC is too

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,510
complicated so I'm going to show you

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:09,170
that's not true anymore

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:16,040
so let's see if it still connected to

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:25,420
internet by the way you can query the

00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:34,010
machine it's it's ok alright it's better

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:36,050
ok ok so we add this is ethnic the

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,590
company I work for we are also don't see

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:40,820
that registry created quite a lot of

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,890
open-source software

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,860
well you might know bird internal

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:49,670
routing daemon but also note the DNS we

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:52,010
just the joke was very funny at the

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,450
beginning but after years of saying it's

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:59,810
not DNS it's not so funny anymore but

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:02,410
but we can't change the name now so if

00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:07,850
you install not DNS which is packaged as

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:10,850
the package not then it's in salt and

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:14,840
it's version 2 which should be eating

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:18,110
unstable soon enough then there is

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,090
something like if you see not then we

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:28,400
are going to create directory for keys

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:32,630
and I can type we have a tool called key

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:37,570
manager and we just enjoys the the

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,570
directory with well there's some

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:45,179
oh sorry what but but that's this okay

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:48,929
because here it stores there's nothing

00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:55,860
here yet but it stores the the keys but

00:18:48,929 --> 00:19:00,029
if I create a new policy to confuse me

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:04,340
as well I will add new policy I can use

00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:07,289
just defaults and it will use RSA

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:10,679
sha-256 I think by default with some

00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:17,090
default key sizes I could also add a new

00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:22,620
policy you can call it just ECDSA and

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:24,509
algorithm is 14 or it can also accept

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:32,879
the mnemonics from Ayane but it's much

00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:36,259
complicated in 14 yes and I think you

00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:40,440
need to type a size because it's not

00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:43,559
it's not perfect yet because this is the

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,190
first version also we can enable an SEC

00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:51,629
free and this is the second policy we

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:54,929
have four four zones so now we have some

00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:57,809
policies you can easily use the default

00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:59,929
one just add something then we have a

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:03,990
configuration file and we will add some

00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:07,110
zone or zones but I think that one zone

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:09,360
is enough for now then I will show you

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,330
that this is also one of the new things

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,419
we have in diversion to you we have some

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:22,200
people called templates so I will just

00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:28,519
add some stuff here think it's like this

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:34,649
website I don't remember this bye

00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:37,970
so yes it's person s and this is a

00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:40,590
default storage for all the domains I'm

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,769
and because it's default it will be just

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:48,960
used for for all the zones it doesn't

00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:50,550
have its own policy so I have this demo

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:57,600
zone

00:20:50,550 --> 00:21:01,050
and just another few things we need to

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:05,760
add this is directory with we

00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:08,820
initialized and then the last thing we

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,280
enable the signing and it should be

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:25,530
enough but it's live demo so things are

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:33,470
expected to break oh we are missing the

00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:36,480
zone so zones and I have something so I

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:39,780
will show it this is just simple simple

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,990
zone I just copied for my normal normal

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:45,930
server which is mastered DNS rocks as I

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:50,330
said I'm a geek so I had to buy a new

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:55,200
gTLD even though it's useless hmm

00:21:50,330 --> 00:22:00,320
so this is not yet signed and one last

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,320
thing because this is the usual program

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:14,090
because the files could be unreadable

00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:19,790
and oh and there's something wrong as

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,790
usual I said that things will break but

00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:31,740
there might be something like I don't

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,800
know

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,800
you

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,450
and this keyboard is giving me a hard

00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:53,350
time because the escape is not where I

00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,350
expect it to be

00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:08,030
okay and this should not be here twice

00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:22,360
and it's missing the configuration for

00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:27,470
the okay so so as I said this is just

00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:30,770
another policy this one with DNA six

00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:34,809
signing turned off and this zone files

00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:37,640
are stored elsewhere and this is the

00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:39,650
module called synth records like

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,220
synthetize and there are two

00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:47,350
configurations one for the forward

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:52,159
records and one for Reverse records and

00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:57,650
it could also work for ipv4 but ipv4 is

00:29:52,159 --> 00:30:01,130
not that hard so the idea is just some

00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:03,620
random string the type as I said is

00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:06,500
forward records so it will generate code

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:08,679
ace the prefix is again some random

00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,809
stride string you want to have in DNS

00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:15,169
TTL for auto-generated records and the

00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:17,539
network it applies to took a liberté to

00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:20,059
use the conference network for the

00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:23,210
reverse records it's similar it the type

00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:25,820
is reverse prefixes to be same so the

00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:30,770
recurse matches and the origin is the

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:35,650
domain name it ends in so again TTL and

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:40,850
the network and now we have I will just

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:45,049
delete the ultimen figuration so we have

00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:48,470
a 2-2 domain names and one is tied to

00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:53,140
two forward zone and one is the PTR

00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,140
records so I will have to copy

00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:10,420
so there are two zones and they only

00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:19,550
have source of origin and NS records and

00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:23,950
the reverse is same and again we issued

00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:33,350
currency reload and hope it works by

00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:35,980
first time so and then I will show you

00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,980
how it works

00:31:40,960 --> 00:32:02,030
for example 15 as I said the keyboard is

00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:02,780
giving me now how do I get rid of the

00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:13,540
split screen

00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:25,420
does anybody know that okay as well okay

00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:30,950
it's not DNA shooters come to rescue and

00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:35,540
this is how to generate a record and if

00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:42,460
I copy that so it copies the picture as

00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:42,460
well and ask for this

00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:56,770
return then there's some hey there there

00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:56,770
there's to be something broken

00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:27,619
whatever

00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:30,259
and the DNA second light signing will

00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:34,070
will be able to sign this as well so if

00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:38,090
you need if you maintain a large ipv6

00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:40,820
pools and you are mandated to have PTR

00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:43,789
records for all of them so then for

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:47,450
example sending emails works then this

00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:49,489
might help you a lot and in well the

00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:53,859
next version of no DNS it could be also

00:33:49,489 --> 00:34:01,820
DNS signed which is a good thing right

00:33:53,859 --> 00:34:04,580
okay questions yes can you hide your

00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:07,309
some ricotta still using that but over

00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:10,700
either a card users on file yes you can

00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:12,319
add record to the zone file well we have

00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:17,480
still some time I can show you that if

00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:20,960
you want okay you know yet you have you

00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:23,000
can have manually while entrance records

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,490
into those zone files I showed you and

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,169
then it will look up them in the zone

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:36,940
file first and then fall back to

00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:43,359
auto-generated synthetize records okay

00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:43,359
so thank you for listening to my DNS

00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:50,010
thank you all very much for coming along

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,010
