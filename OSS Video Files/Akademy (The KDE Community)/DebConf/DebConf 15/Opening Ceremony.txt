welcome everyone that's watching on the

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:49,799
streams are DPL our former dpl's the

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,340
press that is covering the event the

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:59,250
sponsors that are sponsoring everyone is

00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:00,869
welcome so the venue some of you have

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,780
been here ready and know it very well

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:07,459
but some others are new so this is a

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,340
schema of the venue we are currently in

00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:13,319
Heidelberg one two three on the other

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,800
end of the building is the other talk

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,280
room

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,860
which is called Berlin London and if you

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,830
see this schema there's a lot of small

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,580
rooms some of those rooms like Stockholm

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,590
being serious inky Madrid athan some of

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,770
those rooms will be used for buffs or

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,970
talks or in-person meetings and some of

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:37,680
the rooms will be used for hacking but

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,740
basically the whole venue is a big hot

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,770
lab there are some hacking spaces like

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,650
underneath here the stock room there's a

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,170
hacking space with power bars and tables

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,320
but whenever you feel like it you

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,210
couldn't just like if you see a table

00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,220
consider it part of the whole hack lab

00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,510
right the whole venue is a big hug love

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,620
you feel free to hug wherever you want

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:06,900
right so this room is not big enough for

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,060
550 people so when there are planar is

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,840
which means that there's no other talk

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,900
in parallel the other talk room Berlin

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,230
London we'll be streaming the talk so if

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,440
you find that you cannot sit here you

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,390
can go over there and have a seat there

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,370
it's it's not exactly the same as being

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:34,830
in the room but it's better than not

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:36,989
being at all there some additional

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,350
important information the meantime

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:49,940
there's science of all this but just in

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:49,940
case you need to know it somehow yeah

00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,550
so apart from the meal times in the

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:04,270
bistro which is why the lobby we you can

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:07,810
get food like until 2 a.m. so if you run

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:12,370
hungry later you can go and get sandwich

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:14,590
or rub and yeah the prices are lower

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:18,030
thanks to an anonymous sponsor so thank

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,030

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:32,110

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:49,270
tap water yeah so every morning at

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,000
quarter to 10:00 before the first talk

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,270
we will have a morning briefing where we

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,610
will give you important information and

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,620
we will do a raffle yeah this this is

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,770
the previous version of the PDF sorry

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:07,180
something went wrong we will do a raffle

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:12,580
at at the morning briefings tomorrow we

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:19,300
will start with tomorrow we will start

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:22,060

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:26,800
that has like completely free framework

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:29,620
that was donated to us so even though we

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,150
have a lot of things tonight we strongly

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,550
advise that you are there because if you

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,720
are not there you will not get the price

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:41,229
you need to be there to get the price

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,660
that's it so of course this wouldn't

00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:45,970
even be possible without our sponsors

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,680
first and foremost our platinum sponsor

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,680

but still the silver and the brown

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,540
sponsors are also rather important and

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,860
for the infrastructure sponsors

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,630

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,389
outside this afternoon from 2:00 to 6:00

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,650
so the general timeline of the

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,430
conference just briefly is as I said

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,750
right now we in the open weekend part

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,620
tomorrow there will be the cheese and

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,240
wine party s-sorry on Monday excuse me

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,520
there will be a cheese and wine party

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,979
and evening on Wednesday we have the day

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,840
trip I'll get to that in a second and in

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:08,710
evening there is a barbecue here and

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,599
another concert and on Thursday the

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,110
traditional conference dinner which

00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:18,190
takes place above Heidelberg the city

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,990
not the room and finally finally on

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:24,099
Saturday will be the final day and the

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,599
cleanup so for the day trip you you will

00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:27,460
get an initial additional information

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,390
but these are the options we came up

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,040
with

00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,280
there is a wizard to the Technik museum

00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,990
Shivaya and the butcher from Heidelberg

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,240
to Nikesh Dino's and the visit of a

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,600
castle and a visit to beer brewery

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,340
because no debconf in Germany would be

00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,940
complete without that and the optional

00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:48,610
for is the hike for the people

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,290
interested in hiking there will also be

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:55,540
a key signing party which will be not

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,830
not an event but it's a rollover key

00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,040
signing party there's no centralized

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,540
event this is the the hash I will put it

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,070
up later on so you don't have to write

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,430
it down now it will be on the last slide

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,080
but this is the hash so you should

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,810
verify that this is the correct hash and

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:15,100
the general procedure is that you just

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:17,590
come to people and you sign your key and

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,240
you verify the key signing and it's

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:24,490
there'd also to meet people so do that

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:28,420
during the conference so right so these

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:31,390
are the final the things we have the

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,820
website which has the schedule and some

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,100
other important information the most

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,860
important thing really is the wiki so

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:43,240
you should bookmark that best landing

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,380
page Def Con 15 but the FAQ is linked

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,750
there which has lots of information

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,210
please also update the wiki if you have

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,580
some trouble you need to sign up for the

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,320
wiki due to spam bot reasons but it's

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,110
not a big hassle we have lots of people

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,690
doing that you should be on the announce

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,330
list we will try to send out an

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,670
announcement every other day we did send

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,070
one out last night

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,170
just with summarized information of what

what came up you should also be on the

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,680
discuss list if possible so we try to

send our information first to the

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,910
discussed list and then send a

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,390
compilation to announce so if you want

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:22,320
to be informed be there also discussed

00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:24,730
with other people about non urgent or

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,580
