good morning everyone how are you today

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,250
I'm glad someone in the rooms awake

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,099
because I'm struggling a little bit this

00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:17,730
is simultaneously sort of a source of

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:21,060
great pride pleasure and so forth for me

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,609
and a source of amusement having the

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,500
talk at the start of debconf that's

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,660
associated with the fact that my

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,520
employer is the largest sponsor this

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:35,250
year you know that's cool I guess but

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,430
those of you who know me and have seen

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,040
me at everybody TED Conference DEFCON 2

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,860
in Toronto so many years ago well

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,539
understand that for me this is sort of

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,399
an opportunity to do something I hope

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,440
will be sort of fun and a little bit

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,809
interesting and not something I'm going

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,570
to take terribly terribly seriously from

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,649
a corporate kind of perspective so what

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,000
am I going to try and do today well

00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,629
first of all for those of you haven't

00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,730
met me man

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,129
my name is B Dale how many of you in the

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:07,590
room have not seen me or heard me give a

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,210
talk before ok don't be shy Wow at a Deb

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,760
can't even I guess it's because this

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,340
year I think we have a record number of

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:23,130
attendees at Def Con via big amount

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:24,840
is that cool or what I I don't think I'm

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,909
the only person in the room for whom

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,840
this true is true but I've been involved

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,930
with Debian since 1994 and so for me

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,270
having made a very long-term commitment

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,900
to this project with lots of time and

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,180
energy invested in lots of of uses of

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,000
Debian and interesting ways outside

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,070
inside and outside the project it's

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,810
really exciting to me to see this level

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,060
of participation this amount of

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,060
enthusiasm but I must tell you I'm not

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,729
surprised because it mirrors very much

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,670
what I've seen out in the corporate

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,049
world since my return to the workforce

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,329
from an early retirement

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:06,729
last fall so for those of you haven't

00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:09,009
heard me talk before and don't know me

00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:11,170
all that well you want me to use this

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:14,530
one and said it's on to us

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:19,360
okay can I take this off then I really

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:22,530
hate these things okay is that is that

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,060
better Oh everybody seems happier great

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,310
and I can hear a little more audio so it

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,540
must be working better great okay so for

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,610
those of you haven't heard me talk

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,980
before don't know me as well as some of

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,350
those in the room do just exactly who am

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,840
i well I tell people I made my first

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,549
personal contribution of source code to

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,239
this thing we now call free software

00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:45,370
open source in 1979 I would not be

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,340
surprised if a few of you haven't been

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,390
on the planet that long that's okay

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,959
in 2012 I retired after approximately 27

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:58,420
years at hewlett-packard or its various

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,430
subsidiaries the reason I left there's

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,590
two reasons I left one is they made one

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,660
of these really crazy early retirement

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,230
offers you know take lots and lots of

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,450
money and go away please but the other

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:14,620
reason was that my son was just about to

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,450
start high school and I honestly because

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,310
of my job it spent way too much time

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,160
traveling and going to conferences and

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,739
things like that and I really wanted to

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,239
take advantage of the opportunity to do

00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,730
a few things with him before he was

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,859
completely grown and gone away and that

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,019
worked out really really well for about

00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:35,799
nine months and as those of you were in

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:37,870
Switzerland will recall wildfire then

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,549
swept through Colorado and took my house

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,590
away along with lots of other people's

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,329
and the world got kind of strange for a

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,859
while and that was a very very

00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,810
interesting experience to live through

00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:49,000
if you want to hear more details though

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,410
that seems a little more of it I did

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,989
give a talk about that at Linux

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,030
conference Australia in January of 2014

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:57,400
in the video from that's up on the web

00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,530
if you'd like to go look then the really

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,850
interesting thing happened a guy I used

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,560
to work for who was HP's first

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:10,030
vice-president for open-source and Linux

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,660
back in 2003 I guess and the author of

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,630
the book called the biz

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,120
economics of Linux and open-source all

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,209
of a sudden got promoted and is now HP's

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,980
executive vice president and chief

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,320
technology officer which means he's the

00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,490
head of HP labs and he runs HP cloud and

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,510
all sorts of other interesting things

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,710
and then you know a really funny thing

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,740
happened Martin called

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,540
and he said do you remember all those

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,690
conversations we should have back in

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,460
2003 and 2004 about how if we could just

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,740
get the right people in the company to

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,140
say yes we could change a few things and

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,660
maybe go change the world and I said

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,660
yeah and he said I am that guy now

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,520
and so you know that combined with the

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,510
fact that he just kept saying yes to

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,290
what I thought were some sort of

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:04,350
unreasonable demands I find myself back

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,930
at HP I'm now an HP fellow in the office

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,790
of the CTO and my job is to help

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,590
articulate a chippies open-source

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:15,810
strategy it's kind of cool the thing

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,360
that happens in parallel with that that

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,520
for me makes it even more cool is as

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,180
many of you know I've been part of the

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,010
Debian project as I said since 1994 I've

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,910
done a few things in the project over

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,250
that time I've you know once more it's I

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,650
sit on the boards of directors of some

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,060
organizations probably of greatest

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,230
interest and my employers that I have a

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,390
seat on the board of the Linux

00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,160
Foundation but I don't represent HP on

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,740
the Linux Foundation board I represent

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,850
individual members and developers and

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,150
I'm actually kind of proud of that

00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,740
individual members of the aleph reelect

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,380
me each year they've done it now for

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,750
several years to represent their needs

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,610
entrant interests on that board HP is

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,980
also a platinum member of the the Linux

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:02,340
Foundation and Eileen Evans represents

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,280
our interests there on that board I'm on

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,480
the board of the freedombox Foundation

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,760
I'm really excited that the freedombox

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,370
ODOT 5 release which just came out had

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,650
that much involvement for me I had

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,620
nothing to do with it I'm really excited

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,200
about that because that means that even

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,540
though that project took a huge hit in

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,130
schedule and visibility and so forth

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,910
because of the things that happened to

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,290
me in my life in 2013 that what's

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,760
happening there is important enough that

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,320
other people have been willing to pick

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,900
it up and carry on with it and they're

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,240
doing great work so if that's a project

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,640
you still care about I hope you're

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,260
paying attention taking care of the

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,600
things that are offered back to Debian

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,210
from that community and trying to help

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,910
make their work better the other thing

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,430
though is I don't just do open source as

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,560
a job those of you who've known me for a

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,300
long time understand that you know my

00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,550
biggest hobby is turning all of my other

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,290
hobbies into open source projects I've

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,740
given talks at various conferences over

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,930
the years about converting you know

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,520
three axis milling machines and two CNC

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,979
things using a hundred percent open

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:15,199
hardware and open software I've given

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:18,370
talks about how to use GPL free software

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,169
from the canoe radio project to do

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,520
amateur radio bouncing of radio signals

00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,150
off the moon and I've done all sorts of

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,069
stuff like that

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,960
but I'm also a member of the board of

00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,880
directors of Aleph objects which is the

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,370
parent company for something called

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,710
lulzbot Lal spot is interesting they're

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,449
a 3d printer company that was the first

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,460
company in the world to receive the free

00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:39,349
software foundations respects your

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,020
freedom award for all of their hardware

00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:44,240
designs and I'm really really proud to

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,520
be part of that organization they're

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,830
doing really cool stuff making really

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,900
cool products and 3d printing is kind of

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,400
a big deal these days and as those of

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,039
you who've seen me at other dev comps

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,870
before know along with Keith Packard who

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,780
unfortunately couldn't be here this week

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,520
and I'll explain why in a little bit

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,319
along with Keith I'm one of the

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,530
cofounders of this little company called

00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,330
Altus matram and we make open hardware

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,460
and open-source avionics for the

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,889
high-power model rocketry community

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,539
because I love playing around with

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,340
high-power model rockets I also do

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:20,300
things with amateur radio satellites and

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,949
after a long hiatus I'm pleased to

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,050
report that a satellite that I built

00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,780
design and built the processor board for

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,520
is expected to launch and about five or

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,130
six weeks from Vandenberg Air Force Base

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,610
in the u.s. it's a CubeSat which is a

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:37,700
hundred millimeter cube and it has like

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,159
a seven or eight board stack inside

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,339
there one of which is a processor board

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,920
using an ARM Cortex in three that that

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:48,440
Keith and I designed and I did most of

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,410
the work to assemble and yes I literally

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,020
there will be once again a circuit board

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,540
with solder joints done in actually done

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,130
in the garage of the apartment we were

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,290
living in while we were displaced from

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,570
the fire going to orbit and I just think

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,790
that's super cool so those of you

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,680
haven't don't know me all that well and

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,250
don't know what I mean by high-power

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,579
model rockets that's that's a typical

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,279
toy for me that's actually the first

00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:17,209
rocket that I flew after the fire that's

00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:20,179
out in

00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:23,300
Eastern Kansas in the United States and

00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:28,279
that airframe went to mach 1.8 on the

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:30,619
way to should figure this out in advance

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:35,269
six and a half kilometers above ground

00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:37,399
so flying prototypes of new electronics

00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:39,529
and the handsome young fellow there

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,149
carrying the airframe back for me is my

00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:43,819
son Robert if you make it into the room

00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:45,949
yeah there he is Roberts actually with

00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:47,720
me this time so the way we're handling

00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:48,860
this I'm back to work thing is I

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,529
actually brought him to the conference

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,329
this time so this is not his first

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,009
Devcon even though he will profess that

00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:57,259
he doesn't really remember much about

00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:59,809
the last time that's because it was in

00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:02,990
Edinboro and he was literally half of

00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:05,540
his life ago so if you see Robert please

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:09,079
say hello alright so what I really want

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,899
to do today i titled this HP and Debbie

00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,040
in a fresh perspective it's there's a

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:15,589
little bit of a joke in there right

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,809
because I have probably the least fresh

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:19,970
perspective on the relationship between

00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:23,119
HP and Deb Univ anybody in the room I

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,879
had something to do with causing that

00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:27,980
relationship to happen though in all

00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,379
honesty I'm not the one who picked

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,569
Debian as HP's internal Linux

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,100
development platform that honor goes to

00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:37,279
Steve Geary Steve are you in the room

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:40,040
somewhere he may be down the other way

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,779
he is here today though and if you would

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,980
like to I'll be happy to introduce you

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:47,360
to them he'll probably be hanging around

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,589
the HP stand at some point what I want

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,980
to do instead is I want to give you a

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:53,119
little bit of history and because I

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,920
finally got around to thinking about

00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,689
what I should do in the way of

00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,740
presentation materials after the

00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,220
birthday party last night

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,119
I cheated I went back through

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,549
presentations that I've given in the

00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:06,589
past about the relationship with it

00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:07,730
between HP and Debian and I thought it

00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,589
would be kind of fun to pull a few

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,559
slides out of that to sort of tell the

00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:14,209
story and so I very carefully annotated

00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,179
on the lower left corner of each of the

00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:20,029
old slides what year that came from and

00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:22,339
so I hope that that will provide some of

00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,929
you who may remember a few of these you

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:25,579
know some sense of amusement along with

00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:27,410
it but I'm talking a little bit about

00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:30,290
the history and then I'm going to talk

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,630
about what's changing in the world

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,240
and what has caused all of a sudden

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,310
someone like Martin Fink to end up being

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,880
the chief technology officer at a

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:43,400
company like HP and what that means for

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,320
the relationship between HP and Debian

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,660
and then I'm going to talk a little bit

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,740
about what I'm really excited about for

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:54,230
the future which is you know the reason

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,650
that I think this isn't a short-lived

00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:59,660
change this is something where I would

00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,970
expect the relationship between HP and

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:06,589
Debian to just get stronger over time in

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:08,510
the future so back in 2009 I gave a

00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:10,100
presentation or I said that you know the

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,630
powerful thought we all ought to keep in

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,339
mind is that it wasn't there was no

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,910
longer question of whether free software

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:18,680
made sense but rather win on how to best

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,779
use free software to pursue business

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,750
objectives you tell us given this to a

00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,640
business audience right but this is the

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,560
kind of stuff that I used to say when I

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,470
was running around as HP's chief

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,930
technologist for open-source and Linux

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,790
and based on this I said look if you

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,500
want to understand what I'm talking

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,480
about why this makes sense there's a few

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,089
basic ideas you need to have in mind one

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,070
is that what's really important here is

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:46,700
this idea of the community development

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:52,160
model okay open-source is not a business

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:54,560
model it is at best a different way of

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,110
collaborating to produce and maintain

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,940
software but it's a really good one it

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,940
has some interesting attributes one of

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,970
them is that there's no single company

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:07,370
involved responsible now as Bradley

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,230
pointed out in his talk yesterday which

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,110
I hope many of you had a chance to

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,459
attend and if he didn't I hope you'll go

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,250
take a look at the video on that at some

00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,860
point there are lots of cases today

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:22,160
we're particularly source projects are

00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:24,950
backed by one or another company but in

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,660
the main the Linux kernel and many free

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,459
software applications really are

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,070
developed and supported by this thing we

00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:33,050
call the community no one company in

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,390
charge in a range of community

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,370
contributors with varied interests

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,350
abilities coming from different social

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,870
Geographic economic and political

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,230
backgrounds if you don't believe that

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,760
please look around the room if someone

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,560
pointed out to me yesterday one of the

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,800
neat things about coming to Deb conf is

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,880
we don't all look the same

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,760
we're are lots of us coming from

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,839
different places with different

00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,480
backgrounds and you know different

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,579
interests all of whom have made common

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,180
cause to create this outstanding

00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:10,070
operating system and the thing that the

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:13,220
whole free software world changed is

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,320
that we reduced this artificial barrier

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,350
that had been created between producers

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,329
and consumers of software in that time

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,280
period where software that was being

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:26,180
created was primarily being distributed

00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,730
in shrink-wrapped binary boxes there was

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,709
this big distinction between those who

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,230
could create software and those who were

00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:34,910
purchasing and using software what free

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,550
software did is that sort of ruse turned

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,680
us to an earlier time when people

00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,310
working on computers collaborate with

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,860
each other

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:45,079
every user has the flexibility because

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:48,350
of the terms of the licenses that we

00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:50,300
choose to use to decide how they're

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,190
going to get support for the software

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,810
that they're using any user can become a

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:59,630
developer when this started to become a

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,550
big deal it was the beginning of sort of

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,190
changing a lot of things about how the

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,930
IT industry work and if you don't want

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,339
to be a developer no problem you can pay

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,220
somebody else to do it on your behalf

00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:12,050
and the reason this works is that we all

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,930
have access to the source code we all

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,810
are empowered to participate in this

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,490
collaborative ecosystem and one of the

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,089
really important things is if the

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,290
upstream developer ever misbehaves

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,510
developers have the power to fork you

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,550
can take a copy of the code and go

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,430
create a new FocalPoint development and

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:34,490
this curt provides a wonderful feedback

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:38,930
mechanism to ensure that oh that's

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:41,900
lovely thank you very much yeah I'm

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,880
gonna need that soon you have the power

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,280
to fork and we've seen this happen quite

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,230
successfully in the free and open source

00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,740
software world

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:54,589
think back to what happened when X 386

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,230
forked and spawned what's now sort of

00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:59,089
the xorg free desktop world all of a

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,370
sudden what had become a fairly stagnant

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,410
development environment was

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,089
reinvigorated and lots of amazing things

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,410
happen we've seen it happen more

00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:10,519
recently with the split between

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,649
openoffice and libreoffice and the

00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,260
creation of the document foundation and

00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:17,740
all of a sudden this immense enthusiasm

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,810
and lots of developer energy going into

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,329
making better you know desktop and

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,570
productivity software I am in fact using

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:28,310
Libre Office to make this presentation

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,779
not that's maybe one way in which I

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,339
don't sort of do the same thing that

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,260
lots of other people in Debian do but

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:37,070
makes it a lot easier to interact with

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,570
folks in my day job I will tell you and

00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:42,709
why is this so important for companies

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:45,470
like HP well the emergence of this whole

00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:47,420
sort of idea of communities of

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,510
collaborators enabled by the

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,720
connectivity of the internet and open

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,940
access and open standards really changed

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,890
the way software development happens

00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,959
first in the PC industry and now sort of

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:03,680
spreading out from there and the reason

00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,809
for this is that it's really hard to

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,089
predict where the next cool innovation

00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:10,819
is going to come from and so when you

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:14,419
participate in an open and collaborative

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:18,380
development ecosystem you empower people

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:20,480
that you don't know exist to be able to

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,390
do things that you couldn't predict and

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,990
that's what innovation is all about so

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:29,660
if companies want to successfully take

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,000
advantage of the cool things that are

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,600
being developed by people they don't

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,419
know and could not predict the

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,520
activities of in advance they have to

00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:42,860
learn to participate productively as

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,929
citizens in this open and collaborative

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,360
community development process if they

00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:49,940
want to benefit from the consequences of

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,090
this open innovation and so this is sort

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,669
of the engine that has been behind the

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,700
relationship that HP over the years

00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,590
through efforts of mine and many others

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,019
of

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,749
who have attended deb comps this year

00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:07,600
and in the past to try and help drive as

00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:09,460
a set of behaviors and after a while

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,409
where this lettuce though the amusing

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,019
part is when you check the date you

00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:16,149
notice this slide came from 2009 look

00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:20,139
where this one came from listens from

00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:23,049
2002 and this was at that time what HP

00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:25,179
was articulating and telling all of our

00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,889
customers and partners was the approach

00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:28,480
we were going to take to dealing with

00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:31,029
open source we were going to participate

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,129
as an open source community member

00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:34,899
there's an important distinction there

00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:37,029
we didn't say we're going to work with

00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:39,519
the community we said we're gonna go out

00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:41,049
there and be part of the community we're

00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,259
going to support community values and

00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:46,299
behaviors and in the process work on the

00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:48,789
things that matter to the company and to

00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:51,580
its employees which were building robust

00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:53,499
enterprise capabilities so that we take

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,899
all of this free software goodness and

00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:58,360
make it useful to our biggest business

00:18:55,899 --> 00:19:00,639
customers one of the things I'm

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,639
particularly proud of and martin fink

00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:06,119
had a lot to do with is the fact that HP

00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:09,879
has used existing open-source licenses

00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:11,769
almost unique amongst our peers in the

00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:13,690
world of large companies hovering around

00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:15,639
the free and open-source software world

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:19,119
hp's never created its own open-source

00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:21,100
license why we were really lucky to have

00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,600
some super smart lawyers at the right

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,369
moment in history who looked around and

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,970
said well there's nothing wrong with the

00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:29,440
GPL why don't we just use that gee

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,769
there's nothing wrong with the BSD

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,389
license so the MIT license and later nor

00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:38,019
that many things wrong with the apache

00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:42,669
license so we can we can use those it's

00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:44,830
okay though i will tell you if you when

00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,419
i make comments about that like that

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,649
about the apache license i just have to

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,919
point out that it's sort of an

00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:52,960
interesting bargain when you create a

00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:56,110
license that's permissive with a strong

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,730
patent grant if you're a net consumer of

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,249
software under the apache license

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,960
awesome if you're a company that holds a

00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:05,019
steaming pile of patents and your net

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,049
producer of open source software that's

00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:09,580
a big giveaway and the fact that we do

00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,019
as much as we do under that license

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,380
probably so something about just how

00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:13,850
serious we are

00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,650
about wanting this whole thing to be

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,510
successful and then we'd work with

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,400
everybody out there to deliver effective

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,670
and innovative solutions baseness blog

00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,930
right marketing slide well not really

00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,850
this slide actually came from Steve

00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:28,070
Geary and or someone on his team I

00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,990
remember pulling it from that deck and I

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,210
remember just how I mused he was when I

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:35,420
started using this and lots of external

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:37,160
talks so 2002 that's been a while right

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,850
so what's so fresh about that

00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:44,330
perspective well we'll come back to that

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:47,030
so HP and Debian just how long and how

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:50,480
deep is this relationship between the

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:55,550
companies between HP and Debian their

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:59,210
company and the project well I tried to

00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:01,460
sort of sum this up in 2011 the reason

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,350
that this that this relationship exists

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,320
and has been around so long is that

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:09,860
Debian really does matter Bradley gave

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,040
one take on why he thinks Debian matters

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:15,890
yesterday this was the take that I was

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,180
articulating to people in and around who

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,830
thought in fact the slides been around

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:22,220
longer than that's just the deck that I

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,990
pulled this from was from 2011 why does

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:28,250
that mean matter it's it really is all

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:30,980
about freedom it's about the fact that

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:33,860
Debian has a very stable and functional

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,020
development community I had the

00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,090
opportunity year and a half ago

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,460
somewhere in the middle of the hole in

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:44,000
it system discussion within the project

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,700
to remind myself and many of you that

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,040
there's a non vocal majority of Debian

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,070
developers who just keep doing the right

00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,350
thing making outstanding free software

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,090
and ensuring that that outstanding free

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,280
software is available to everybody in

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:03,110
the world no matter what else is going

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,610
on and that's immensely powerful the

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,520
large number of architectures and

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:09,770
packages has been a really important

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,770
part of why Debian matter to HP over the

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:15,050
years why is that well you may remember

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:21,499
a processor architecture called pa-risc

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:23,879
you may remember Itanium yeah you know

00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:26,279
the fact that Debian has always been

00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:28,919
open to contributions and taken what we

00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,289
now call sort of the big tent approach

00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,059
the notion that if there's something you

00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:35,369
care about and you're willing to come do

00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:38,220
that on behalf of Debian it's okay that

00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:40,860
can become part of Debian is immensely

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,950
enabling for a company that has

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:47,179
objectives they'd like to achieve and if

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:50,100
the choice is go talk to a commercial

00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:52,619
partner and try to convince them that

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,169
your vision is the one that is the right

00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:56,879
one and they say well yes as long as you

00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:58,350
have a really really big checkbook and

00:22:56,879 --> 00:23:00,809
are willing to pay less lots of money

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,909
we're willing to go do that for you or

00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:05,340
the alternative is you hire some smart

00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:07,169
people and you go join an open and

00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,970
collaborative community and you do some

00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:11,460
work yourself and achieve the results

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,529
you wanted to have at a lower cost and

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,299
with a higher degree of engagement and

00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:17,759
build some reputational equity in the

00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:20,850
process it's not a terribly difficult

00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:23,129
choice to make and honestly one of the

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:25,139
things I personally have found the most

00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:28,350
appealing about Debian over the time is

00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:31,379
the notion there are these benefits we

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:34,529
get from having policies that drive

00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:37,739
towards a uniform experience there are

00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:40,350
days when the way Debian policy is being

00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:43,049
created and adjusted gets frustrating

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:45,090
and in particular if you're someone who

00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:47,399
has a really great idea that in the end

00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,350
does end up changing the world and

00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:51,720
everybody in Debian wants to go do

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:54,179
things that way that period of time

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,179
where not everybody else sees it yet and

00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:59,789
you'd like to help sort of create a new

00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:02,070
vision and drive things forward but our

00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:04,259
policy process seems sort of reactive

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,299
instead of predictive that can get kind

00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:08,429
of frustrating but on the flip side the

00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:10,350
fact that our policy is built by

00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:11,850
collecting and aggregating best

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,539
practices that have been demonstrated

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:17,639
and proven to be successful and then we

00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:20,279
turn around and use that to drive the

00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:22,909
behavior of new packages that are

00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:26,190
entering the archive gives us a

00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:27,929
uniformity a robustness and in some

00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:30,870
sense a scalability that I don't think

00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:33,690
any other software project on the plan

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,920
has had any dream of matching it's been

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,870
very interesting for example I've

00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,800
attended the last couple OpenStack

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:42,390
summits and I watched the anxiety with

00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,970
which they're trying to decide whether

00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,960
it's okay to have more than a dozen or

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:51,420
so projects that are part of the core

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,150
thing that they call OpenStack I'm not

00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,760
close enough to those projects those

00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:59,010
specifics or to the politics on that to

00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,070
really understand the tension very well

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:04,190
but when I think about an organization a

00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:07,080
community that's struggling to deal with

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:10,050
transitioning from a dozen or so things

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,059
inside the envelope to something bigger

00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:15,050
than that and I compare and contrast

00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:18,059
that with Debian where we now have what

00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:20,490
30-some thousand packages in the archive

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,610
I've lost track I used to pull that

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:26,610
number for all of my talks and Wow the

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:28,440
you know the the customers with it but I

00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,600
don't do that anymore it's just the

00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,250
numbers are too big and then the other

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,100
thing that's happened that I think you

00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:37,140
all understand because of a few big

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,700
visible examples like I've been to is

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,820
that there's a huge downstream

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,370
dependency chain a lot of people use

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,860
Debian and depend on it to create other

00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:49,770
things that matter to them this is true

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,809
inside HP as well and not just for the

00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:54,030
big obvious things like the fact that a

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:56,520
couple of times in history HP has

00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:59,179
created specialized variants of Debian

00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,250
to do particular things on our

00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:04,320
open-source review board which takes a

00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:06,570
look at all of the proposed interactions

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,740
between free and open-source software

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:11,790
projects and proprietary software

00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,250
projects inside the company

00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:16,500
it's interesting how often when you dig

00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:19,740
down into the details of the proposal

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,570
you see Debian version numbers because

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,400
even if all they're doing is pulling two

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:26,100
or three source packages for something

00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,020
to go build an embedded device inside

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,450
the company people generally understand

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:34,290
that Debian main is a place they can go

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:36,570
to find sources which are packaged

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:39,600
consistently likely likely to be

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,990
rebuildable and where the license

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,630
assertions and other

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:46,840
metadata about the packages are being

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,250
well cared for and so it ends up being

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,220
embedded and wants and lots of

00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,440
interesting places so why does HP work

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,480
with Debian well as I mentioned the sort

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,120
of inclusive collaborative nature of the

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,690
project aligns very well with our

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,159
understanding of this reality that the

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,070
world is becoming more open and

00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:08,409
collaborative its enabled us to go

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,870
tackle some markets that were not being

00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:12,760
well served otherwise those of you who

00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,970
remember back to one of the predecessors

00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,520
of the Linux Foundation OS DL may

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,679
remember that there was this huge fiasco

00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,679
when the companies that were members of

00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,110
a STL sat down and created something

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,730
called the carrier grade Linux

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:31,059
specification this is a specification

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,429
for the features and capabilities that

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:35,860
these companies wanted to have Linux

00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:37,840
exhibit in order to be able to use it

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,000
for building out the mobile phone

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,409
network in the various applications that

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,140
are part of that network around the

00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:45,820
world what happened

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,159
well the kernel community did exactly

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,230
what you would expect they said what do

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,179
you mean you have this big specification

00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,950
you want us to all go write software

00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:57,279
against that's not how free software

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:59,080
works if you want this do it bring it to

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,299
us we'll tell you if it's reason why and

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,429
by the way don't bring it all to us at

00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,080
the end come work with us so that we can

00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:06,820
see what your objectives are and

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,029
collaborate with you piecemeal and do

00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:13,029
all of this that was you know a huge

00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:15,130
fiasco because OS dl brought a bunch of

00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:17,860
companies together that created this

00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:20,080
specification in sort of classic closed

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,370
room discussion specification style and

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,049
then sort of threw it over the wall the

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,899
kernel community in the kernel community

00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:27,429
threw it right back at them

00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:30,580
well somebody at HP looked around and

00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:32,919
said well you know it's not that it's a

00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,110
bad idea it's just that that was the

00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,029
wrong way to go about it

00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:39,010
so what happened well HP put a team

00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:40,750
together that went and built an

00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:45,059
implementation of carrier-grade Linux

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:47,830
and it yielded a product that was called

00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:50,520
Debian Canoe Linux with HP telco

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,520
extensions

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,559
because in fact the easiest way to build

00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,539
that was to go to the colonel work that

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,940
was required package up the few

00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:03,519
Additional Protocol management utilities

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:07,419
and so forth and bundle it all together

00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:10,779
on top of Debian and in fact there was a

00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:16,330
point in history where HP sold more

00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:19,149
units of Itanium servers in the nebs

00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:21,970
compatible embedded into telco racks

00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:24,580
packaging running that software then

00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:27,389
some industry analysts reported was the

00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:30,100
entire size of the Itanium market so

00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:31,899
okay we only had three or four customers

00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,519
but they were the companies that built

00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:35,409
all the infrastructure for all the

00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,289
powerful phone systems in the world and

00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:40,659
as a result I was told at one point that

00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:44,350
one-third of all mobile phone calls

00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:46,869
every day on the planet touched an HP

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:50,450
integrity server running Debian Linux

00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:53,589
with HP telco extensions

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,589
[Music]

00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:59,659
pretty cool is that still true today I

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:02,240
have no idea I haven't even talked to

00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:04,850
the guys that do the carrier-grade telco

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,620
stuff in HP for a while but that is

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:09,019
still a business and HP sells a lot of

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,200
stuff there so there might still be some

00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:14,120
truth there I have no idea

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,260
so anyway great platform for internal

00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,210
developers and then the weird thing that

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,130
happened eventually is that my server

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,019
customers came along so but but but but

00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,669
you guys really seemed to understand

00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,590
Debian we really liked your servers

00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:27,049
would you like officially support Debian

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,399
on your servers please and so there came

00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:28,909
a point in time where we actually went

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,269
and did that

00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:34,610
now today things have changed a little

00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:37,429
bit because you know everything's gotten

00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:39,649
broader and shallower in some ways so

00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:41,750
now instead of hp.com slash go slash

00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:44,480
Debian which by the way still works you

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,799
can type that URL in it will URL in and

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,720
it will still take you somewhere where

00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:50,059
it really takes you as this page called

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,399
community Linux and the other thing

00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:53,840
that's really changed is that back then

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,539
the reason that was an important

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,730
question is that HP server platforms

00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:01,460
even though they were industry standard

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:03,980
had some value added platform management

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,350
capabilities and you really wanted the

00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,149
special software to work with those

00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,220
management capabilities and having

00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:11,750
somebody build packages of that for

00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,720
Debian so you could just install them

00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,130
and use them was considered important

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,809
the world's changed since then there are

00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,269
open standards now for all of those

00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:22,610
management interfaces many of which were

00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:25,730
developed or driven by engineering teams

00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,549
at HP so today you could buy an HP

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:30,200
server you really don't need to have

00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:32,269
special software in order to run a

00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,309
particular Linux distribution that

00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:36,440
part's just changed a little bit which

00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,539
is part of what I meant about broader

00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,429
and shallower the shallower part is you

00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:42,769
don't need as much special software to

00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:45,740
make a supposedly industry standard

00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:46,760
server just work with Linux and all the

00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,909
right works being done to make sure

00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:53,059
things work well there's been lots of

00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:54,289
internal uses of that mean at HP some of

00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:56,990
you probably don't know that a lot of

00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:59,600
the Debian org servers were down edited

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,909
at one time or another by HP and then we

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,280
when we ran into that period during

00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:08,180
what's now called the global economic

00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:10,640
turn and the money for just donating

00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:12,200
servers kind of dried up I came up with

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,770
an interesting hack that allowed us to

00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,620
offer hardware to Debian and kernel.org

00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:21,350
and freedesktop.org and other people at

00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,060
our deepest commercial discount when you

00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,760
combine this with companies that you

00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:28,640
know did all of a sudden have lots of

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,080
commercial success and lots of money we

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,570
had some interesting donation

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,220
partnerships where in the kernel space

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,900
for example there were a couple of

00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,720
rounds where Google provided the money

00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,190
and we offered a super deep discount and

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,490
the result was sort of a combined

00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:45,020
donation to the project where you know

00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:47,300
we gave something

00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,820
mumble mumble percent of a discount

00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,980
which was big and somebody else coughed

00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,990
up the rest of the cash and let me tell

00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,460
you that worked out really well for HP

00:32:53,990 --> 00:33:00,500
right because all of a sudden we're

00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:04,790
getting credit for donating stuff at the

00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:06,770
end of the day but part of that's the

00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:09,590
reason that you know this has ended up

00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:13,160
being a very long-lived relationship a

00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:14,840
number of years ago when John Corbett

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,430
and the folks at Linux weekly news found

00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,490
themselves having to change their

00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:22,790
business model and charge for access to

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:25,340
some of their content John actually

00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:28,550
called me and he said isn't there some

00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,770
way we can come up with to ensure that

00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:34,370
people in Debian don't have to pay to

00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:35,870
get to lwn I said you're right that that

00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,630
would be a great thing for somebody to

00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,010
figure out how to do and not having any

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,410
idea what would happen I sent a message

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:44,930
at my management chain at HP at the time

00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,470
and a guy who worked a couple of clicks

00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,840
above me

00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:50,360
Martin Fink came back and said sure we

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,030
could do that what would it cost you

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,740
notice the sequence of that he said yes

00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:57,230
we could do that and then he asked what

00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,820
it would cost and then of course I

00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,170
talked to John and John being John it

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,900
cost a whole lot less than I really

00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:05,870
should have but four years now HP has

00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:08,510
been happy to sponsor a corporate

00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:09,980
subscription to double unit to Linux

00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,200
weekly news on behalf of Debian

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,060
developers if there any of you in the

00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,530
room who are WM developers or Debian

00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,510
maintainer x' who don't have

00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,919
access to that go to a little web search

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,169
on it you'll find what the procedure is

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:23,780
you will eventually when I get around to

00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:26,120
reading my email get a cheery email back

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,130
from me telling you that you know Ifill

00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,700
access to lwn because yes I still

00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:34,159
personally babysit that ok so a few

00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:38,240
highlights from HP and debian early

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:41,720
history the very first dedicated to HP

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,510
server master debian org is something i

00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,550
built out of cast-off hardware from a

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,200
data center in HP in Colorado Springs

00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:51,050
and hosted for about a year and a half

00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,669
on HP's bandwidth um I actually had

00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:56,419
permission to do that because I was the

00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:58,190
guy who managed that data center and the

00:34:56,419 --> 00:35:00,790
way we did internal accounting meant

00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,350
that it didn't cost anything extra and

00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:05,690
that was all ok until the corporate

00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,980
auditors were due to come in and I was a

00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,450
little concerned that I might have

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,870
questions to answer about what that

00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:13,430
thing over in the corner was at which

00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,890
point you know things changed and got

00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:19,370
broader and we brought in other folks

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:20,930
who had better control over some of

00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,910
those decisions than I did at that point

00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:25,190
in history but I still think it's pretty

00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:27,920
amusing today that I can stand up here

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,380
and publicly tell you that I built a

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,270
server and hosted it in an HP data

00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,520
center and my managers at HP are

00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:38,000
actually proud of the fact that I was

00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:41,450
tipping that back then there was direct

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,060
investment made by Debian in the port's

00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:46,040
or by HP in the ports of Debian to

00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,680
pa-risc and Itanium or which was the

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,950
i-64 architecture when I say direct

00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:56,450
investments pa-risc I'll tell you a

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:59,450
funny story when HP and Compaq did their

00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:01,160
merger acquisition thing Compaq had

00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:03,440
previously purchased Digital Equipment

00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,050
Corporation and Digital Equipment

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,170
Corporation was the company that built

00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,340
the original VAX computers and many of

00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,710
you in the room probably aren't old

00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,290
enough to remember faxes or to think

00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,510
faxes were cool but there was a point in

00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:19,460
history where VAX is particularly VAX is

00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:23,330
that we're running Berkeley UNIX were

00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:25,400
really really cool and so it happened

00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,430
that the day the merger was consummated

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,520
I was in Dayton Ohio

00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:33,010
at the annual Dayton amateur radio

00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,630
convention the Dayton ham vention which

00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,760
is the largest at the time was the

00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,500
largest gathering of amateur radio

00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,839
operators every year in the world I

00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,599
understand that Friedrichshafen might

00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:46,930
actually be as big or bigger now but who

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,670
knows the point is I was walking around

00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:52,329
in the flea market and I saw some

00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:54,250
Russian guys selling used micro Vox

00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:59,349
machines and I couldn't help myself I

00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:01,990
bought one and I took it I took it home

00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:03,970
and well that night from the hotel room

00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:05,680
I put an email out on the internal

00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:08,799
mailing list for open source and Linux

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,510
stuff and I said hey in honor of the

00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:12,730
consummation of the merger and the

00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:14,890
acquisition of the residuals to the VAX

00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:20,619
by HP I'm pleased to announce the

00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:22,329
formation of the Debian VAX port I sent

00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:25,690
this to a lot of people on I got exactly

00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:27,579
one reply and it was from Martin Fink

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,010
and it was a one-liner and he said well

00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:37,480
that certainly makes the pa-risc port

00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:40,569
look more relevant now doesn't it so

00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,119
anyway yeah pa-risc yes that

00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:44,680
architecture but it is kind of pa-risc

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,210
lazar really the kernel work on here

00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,740
that risk was really important to HP

00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:49,660
because that was the thing that got HP

00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,650
to realized that this community open

00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:55,119
collaboration model really really worked

00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:57,400
you know people that HP didn't know

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,770
about and wasn't employing got to a

00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,609
shell prompt booting Linux on a pa-risc

00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:05,260
system without HP's help and once the

00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:08,079
company saw that they kind of went oh

00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:11,289
wow you know could we have some of that

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,510
please and that led to a lot of things

00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:15,130
that happen later a thing I'm

00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,930
particularly personally proud of that

00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,880
some of you will remember is that HP

00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:21,099
sponsored the legal work that originally

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,890
allowed us to include crypto code in

00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:26,079
u.s. Maine and if that had never

00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:29,500
happened in the world would probably be

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,849
a different place as I mentioned we've

00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,020
contributed a lot of simple another

00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:36,160
thing that I mentioned yesterday in the

00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:40,479
version and the newcomers session I

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,609
guess is that starting at DEFCON 3 and

00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:46,329
HP's been a major financial sponsor of

00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:48,009
DEFCON 4 every year why it seems really

00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:51,969
simple to me it's obvious to me that

00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:54,489
every time we help sponsor as a company

00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:56,319
an opportunity for individual developers

00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:59,739
to get together and meet each other and

00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:01,689
build social relationships to have a

00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:03,789
meal with each other to have a beer with

00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:06,029
each other to sit around and talk about

00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:08,949
what's important to them in the world

00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:12,369
they build relationships that can

00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:14,559
survive the intensity of online

00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:17,829
communications that sometimes get really

00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:20,019
contentious if you if when you read an

00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:21,849
email from somebody you have in your

00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:23,949
mind a picture of what that person looks

00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:26,619
like and what kind of you know beverage

00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:29,829
they prefer and you know do they smoke

00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:32,380
or not and you know do they bathe often

00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:34,959
enough or not and all of those things

00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,989
it's a whole lot easier to put what

00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:40,359
they're saying in context right is the

00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:42,099
problem with a lot of online text-based

00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:43,900
communications is when that message

00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:46,479
comes in you have to figure out what the

00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,579
person was trying to tell you you can

00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:51,880
see the words but that doesn't always

00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:54,729
give you the meaning and this is why I'm

00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,109
really proud that HP has been you know

00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:58,119
there have been some years where other

00:39:56,109 --> 00:40:01,630
companies put up more money that year

00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,849
but if we summit from DEFCON 3 in Oslo

00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:07,599
until today HP has been a sponsor every

00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:12,339
year at some level and the the number is

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,479
the biggest which is kind of cool yeah

00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:16,390
I've already talked about a collective

00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:18,309
Oh thin clients you know thin clients

00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,569
little things that are computers with

00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:21,519
the display and a keyboard the mouse

00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:23,199
that don't have disk drives and don't

00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,359
have a local copy the software image

00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:28,929
unless nowadays it's often burned into

00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,969
flash a little known secret when HP

00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:33,459
became the number one seller of thin

00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:34,959
clients in the world it was done with

00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:37,269
Debian running on the inside of every

00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:38,739
single one of them even the ones we were

00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:41,469
selling to customers who were going to

00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:44,439
run remote windows instances off of

00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:46,559
shared windows server thingies what was

00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:50,079
running in the thin client was Debian

00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,039
and because of the success with that

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,040
they've done some other really

00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:53,780
interesting things and

00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,330
than point-of-sale systems which are

00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,370
frankly a lot like thin clients we

00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:01,010
actually built some Debian based desktop

00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:03,980
systems that sold quite well in emerging

00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:05,990
markets emerging markets you know and I

00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,540
mean the places like China and India and

00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:11,360
so forth why does this stuff not show up

00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,010
in the rest of the world I don't like to

00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:18,470
talk about that at Linux conference

00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:20,660
Australia in 2013 because it was after I

00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:22,880
retired and before the fire where I

00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,620
talked about sort of the economics and

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,820
the challenges associated with the

00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:30,980
desktop market and why Linux on desktops

00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,440
is a really challenging business

00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,790
proposition but lots of other folks have

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,020
pointed out since that that doesn't

00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,290
really matter because who cares about

00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,850
desktops anyway this is running Linux

00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,410
most of these are running Linux sadly

00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:44,720
very few of them are running Debian we

00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,790
could do better there but whatever but

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,590
I'm very proud that this relationship

00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:51,680
between HP and Debian over the years

00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,930
yielded lots of interesting fruit and it

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,850
was only part of a larger strategy that

00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:57,770
has led to a situation where for more

00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,560
than 15 years HP has been the largest

00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:04,340
seller of stuff to people running Linux

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,650
and that stuff includes servers it

00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,480
includes you know high availability

00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:11,150
software that you can run on top of

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,120
Linux to you know do Enterprise sort of

00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:16,910
data center things in the personal

00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,860
system space it's you know there's lots

00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,570
of Linux base things there that are

00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,850
being sold and even in the enterprise

00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:25,340
services world we build an awful lot of

00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:28,220
solutions for a lot of customers using

00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,600
Linux and open source stuff so that's

00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:33,350
sort of the end of the history part

00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:35,660
what's changed well the good news is for

00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,700
the relationship between HP and Debian

00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,500
the things that have changed are causing

00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,380
this relationship to just keep getting

00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,510
more important and better over time but

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:48,530
I think it's useful to understand what

00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:51,940
the thinking is in places like HP about

00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:54,530
what's happening in the IT world today

00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,600
the first thing is that businesses under

00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:59,210
are continue to be under intense

00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,950
pressure that's been true for a long

00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,560
time and just

00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:06,340
hasn't changed because of those

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:09,040
pressures there's been an emergence of a

00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:11,620
change in the way people think about

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,920
building technology solutions because

00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:18,250
the reality is people build IT solutions

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,170
to solve business problems right in the

00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:23,580
in the corporate world and we're now

00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:27,130
into a model where the intersection of

00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:30,190
mobility social networking big data in

00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:32,800
the cloud is leading us to do almost

00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:36,430
everything in an open and collaborative

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,920
kind of model an HP strategy these days

00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:41,530
at the top this is not the open-source

00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,510
strategy this is the company strategy is

00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:46,420
to provide solutions for this new style

00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:50,110
of IT yeah so it's a marketing slide

00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:52,690
don't worry about the details but what

00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:55,630
this means is that that something has

00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:58,090
changed a little bit in the way HP

00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:00,190
thinks about open source that slide that

00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:03,070
I showed you from 2002 is all about

00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:05,230
we're gonna go be part of mostly

00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,790
existing communities we're gonna use

00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,530
their licenses we're going to

00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,330
participate as good citizens we're gonna

00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:13,330
drive the features and capabilities that

00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:15,700
matter to us the thing that's kind of

00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:17,980
changed in the time since then is the

00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,770
number of places where a new piece of

00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:23,620
software created from scratch by the

00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:26,980
company to solve some problem that the

00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:29,050
company sees our customers having is now

00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,210
being released as a completely

00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,370
open-source thing this is one example

00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:36,480
that's recent that many of you probably

00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:40,660
haven't seen unless DevOps is your thing

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,100
cloud slang I'm not going to spend a lot

00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,450
of time talking about these I'm going to

00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,730
show you the names of a couple of

00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:48,910
projects and if these are spaces you're

00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:50,440
interested in please go take a look this

00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:53,380
is a tool for helping to automate

00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,180
various DevOps use cases there's another

00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,070
project very green which is just in the

00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,160
process of being released right now but

00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:02,040
you can go search for it and find the

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,440
source repository out there right now

00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:09,220
this is it's a gated check-in process

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,660
for software collaborative software

00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:14,510
projects it's somewhere kind of

00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,520
tween a do-nothing approach and what

00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:18,890
happens with Garrett and some folks are

00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:22,160
finding this to be in a very productive

00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:25,220
part of CI solutions that they want to

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,530
build today another project that's come

00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:30,260
out of HP very recently was announced

00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:33,170
publicly at HP discover in Las Vegas a

00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:35,359
few weeks ago is a new user interface

00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:38,990
and user experience framework called

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:41,510
grommet grommet is a project that HPE

00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:43,930
started frankly because we looked around

00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:46,039
our CEO looked around and said you know

00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,630
we've quired a bunch of companies that

00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:49,819
had a bunch of interesting software

00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,170
assets we have this cool portfolio of

00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:53,359
solutions we're delivering to our

00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,619
customers today would it be nice if they

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:59,299
all look like they came from the same

00:45:54,619 --> 00:46:01,460
company and instead of just sort of

00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:03,890
making them all share the same shiny

00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:06,349
part of what grommets tried to do is

00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:08,630
ensure that parts of the experience

00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:11,030
really are consistent that when you go

00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:13,849
to a search bar that what it means to

00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:16,579
search has some sense of consistency to

00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:18,799
not just where the search bar is placed

00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:21,650
and how you type in it and what it looks

00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:24,109
like but how it works underneath is also

00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:26,240
sort of consistent I will be completely

00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:28,670
honest with you and tell you I don't

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,299
write this kind of software I have no

00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:34,369
personal ability to judge how great

00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:36,799
kramat is or isn't but I do know that

00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:38,390
the companies put a lot of energy into

00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:41,000
developing and building this doing

00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:44,240
customer focus groups to figure out how

00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,089
to make things look good in ways that

00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,549
will be productively usable and I really

00:46:47,089 --> 00:46:54,170
hope that this ends up having a big

00:46:49,549 --> 00:46:56,119
impact on the world as a result there

00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:58,549
are a bunch of folks from HP here this

00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:01,359
week some of whom are deeply involved in

00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:03,799
healing on which is HP's OpenStack

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,809
implementation one of the things I

00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:08,420
wanted to point to in here which if you

00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:10,730
were in Portland you had the opportunity

00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:14,059
to hear about a year ago is this thing

00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:17,809
called h linux h linux is a branded

00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:20,800
subset of debian that HP uses at the

00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:24,020
base of its Helion OpenStack implement

00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,990
H Linux is over time starting to have

00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:29,390
broader application and as we move

00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:32,660
towards the future it's going to get

00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:34,520
even more important I have very little

00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:37,070
time left but I'm going to spend just a

00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,370
couple of minutes telling you about the

00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:42,350
thing that makes me so excited about

00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:44,900
having been invited to go back and do

00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:47,810
some work at HP for a while and it's

00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:50,750
this thing that Martin Fink at HP has

00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:53,650
named the machine out of curiosity how

00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:55,880
many of you have heard about the machine

00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,500
for the rest of you I'm not going to

00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,130
spend a lot of time talking about it if

00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:04,790
you go do a web search on HP the machine

00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:07,280
or think the machine you can find some

00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:09,560
video presentations about this and some

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:13,550
other minta presentation materials the

00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:16,250
fundamental idea is that as we see the

00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:19,160
emergence and intersection of a couple

00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:21,860
new lines of development that have been

00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,590
research projects in places like HP Labs

00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:27,500
for a lot of years coming into the

00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:30,200
marketplace almost simultaneously we

00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:33,440
have the opportunity to rethink what

00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:36,530
servers really mean and all of a sudden

00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,200
the notion that a server can mean a huge

00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:42,980
pile like really large numbers of

00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:46,160
special-purpose cores interconnected

00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:48,620
with chip level photonic interconnects

00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,880
I'm not talking about fiber-optic off

00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,980
the edge of the circuit board I'm

00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,720
talking about actual integrated circuits

00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:57,140
with optical interconnects two other

00:48:53,720 --> 00:49:00,980
things on the board and really massive

00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:03,730
memory pools by which I mean think about

00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:06,860
a single system with something like a

00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:09,260
hundred and sixty eight petabytes a byte

00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:14,810
addressable non-volatile storage that's

00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:19,190
as fast as DRAM can we do that today

00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:21,290
no is it coming soon yes now what's the

00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:22,790
implication of that well if you're going

00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:25,100
to bring something like the machine to

00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,930
life and it's changing this many

00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,450
characteristics of what servers have

00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:30,980
been like in the past it's opened up a

00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,990
whole range

00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:37,550
parallel research activities have been

00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:40,609
underway on HP Labs here's the big sort

00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:42,680
of interesting news those research

00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:46,369
activities may eventually lead us to

00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:48,170
discover some characteristic of these

00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:49,820
hardware systems that cause us to

00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,590
believe that some operating system other

00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,230
than Linux would be the right solution

00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:57,380
but we haven't found one today so Linux

00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:59,570
will be the first perhaps the only for a

00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:02,270
while operating system for the machine

00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:04,490
the reason Keith Packard couldn't be

00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:07,220
here at Def Con this year is that he

00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:09,560
recently rejoined HP to serve as chief

00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:14,150
architect for the Linux implementation

00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:16,490
on the machine and as a result he's at

00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:19,040
the Linux foundations Linux con North

00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:21,530
America this week giving a keynote about

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:25,130
the implementation of Linux for the

00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:26,750
machine yeah they asked me if I'd give a

00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,250
keynote and I said sorry I'm gonna be in

00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,550
Heidelberg at DEFCON 4 I couldn't

00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:33,530
possibly do that and so my apologies to

00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:36,590
Keith for helping to ensure that he

00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:38,480
couldn't be at Def Con this year but the

00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:39,800
developers working on the machine and HP

00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,830
Labs and elsewhere in the company are

00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,830
running H Linux H Linux is Debian and

00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:53,450
then finally the intersection of these

00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:55,580
large fast byte addressable non-volatile

00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,140
memories and device level photonic

00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,690
interconnect really is going to change

00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:02,960
the way we think and this is going to

00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:06,890
lead over time to the release into open

00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,650
source of a number of new libraries and

00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:11,540
application development tools that will

00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,400
help to take advantage of the

00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,410
performance of systems with these kind

00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,910
of characteristics the first one of

00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:18,980
those that we've put out is this library

00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,350
called photos it's a research project

00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,330
it's not something you should go drop

00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:27,050
Oracle to run this instead believe me

00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:29,090
but there are some interesting things

00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:32,060
that we're learning because for the

00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:33,470
first time in decades the things that

00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,690
the machine is going to bring are

00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,540
motivating us to do fundamental research

00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:40,369
into operating systems and applications

00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:42,180
development that in a way that corporate

00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:44,849
development labs just haven't been

00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:48,539
very much for a while this is the first

00:51:44,849 --> 00:51:50,930
of what I hope will be dozens of new

00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:53,700
open-source projects this is GPL code

00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:55,650
GPL with a class path linking exception

00:51:53,700 --> 00:52:00,240
because it's a library we want people to

00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:02,180
be able to use it but look forward to

00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,430
more of this stuff coming in the future

00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:06,510
so to wrap things up I hope I've shown

00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:09,960
that free and open source software

00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:13,260
really enables us to have this new style

00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:17,190
of IT this this of combination of mobile

00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:20,640
social cloud big data all you know the

00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:22,500
popular buzzwords today HP has been and

00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,500
will continue to be not just a

00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,960
participant in all of this but an open

00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,329
and collaborative leader in the free

00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,099
software world and that HP's

00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:35,190
collaboration with Debian has been going

00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:37,589
on for a long time and I just don't see

00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:40,559
any possibility other than that

00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:43,260
continuing to go up and to the right in

00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,710
the future thank you very much for your

00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,710
time and attention

00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:59,829
I'm getting the police shut up cuz your

00:52:58,059 --> 00:53:01,599
times out things from the back but if

00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:03,970
anybody has a burning question or two

00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:09,160
I'm certainly happy to answer one or two

00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:11,349
before I walk away and while

00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,119
unfortunately my son Robert has to go

00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:14,619
back home tomorrow because school starts

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,510
for him on Tuesday morning I will be

00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:18,549
here until Sunday and I'll look forward

00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:20,260
to having lots and lots of conversations

00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:21,579
with many of you about many different

00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,109
topics during the week so once again

00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:24,970
thank you very much for your time and

00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:27,690
attention and for all the cool things

00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,690
