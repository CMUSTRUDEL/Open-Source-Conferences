	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,309
yeah so hello everyone let me introduce

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:10,309
werner cook the primary author of no PG

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:31,969
thank you thank you oh that's a bit of

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,710
feedback so can you understand me all

00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:39,629
yeah yeah okay so fine um yeah I've been

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,000
asked to give a talk here and obviously

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,710
I don't give a technical talk about GPG

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,450
and how to encrypt and all this stuff

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,670
but it's not very interesting for this

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,789
hacker community here right now so

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,520
instead the idea was that I tell

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,520
something about the past present and

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,890
future of canoe Fiji

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,329
so this is just a sketch of the history

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,359
and what we are going to do in the

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:06,869
future so and I think I have to have a

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:13,070
bit to hurry so well so this is of water

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:17,159
past if we walk back well 25 years or to

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:19,439
1991 this was a time I start quit my job

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,720
and started as a freelancer but more

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,470
interesting is that fit simmerman then

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,229
wrote a little tool called PGP which was

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,420
used to encrypt and which was encrypt

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,600
data mostly enabled nets and the early

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,270
internet to keep confidential so he said

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,700
it the ngos back then for the

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,450
anti-nuclear movement they needed a

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,280
secure way of communicating and so he

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,399
brought the first public tool which was

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,320
easy easy to use for non geeks well kind

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,090
of non geeks but people who use network

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,710
network SPECT and that were all kind of

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:58,950
geek so and that was yeah I think in 91

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:02,490
and the cool thing is it was the first

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,409
real usable kryptos crypto software you

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,049
could use outside of military or

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,209
government stuff and well it worked um

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,819
it didn't work really good from

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,120
cryptographers point of view because he

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,890
had the

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,920
little thing what in amateur

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:21,879
cryptographer does he invented his own

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,569
algorithm next and this was excusable

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:28,180
because nobody encryption all this stuff

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:31,239
it was very new to the to the public or

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,280
for an average programmer nobody knew

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,790
what how this contraption work the only

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,620
thing people

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,739
UNIX people know where the crew program

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,409
and which does a bit of DES encryption

00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:45,299
for the past for the past races also HTC

00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:49,569
passport so a couple of people like

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:51,819
Peter got man half any Derek Atkins they

00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:54,609
helped him to fix PGP one by replacing

00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:57,790
the not that good homemade algorithms by

00:02:54,609 --> 00:03:00,909
standard algorithms PGP to or took up

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,579
then thinks of about ninety ninety two

00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:06,069
so it was used everyone all gigs have

00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:09,400
started to create the keys from

00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:12,970
military-grade keys or like which back

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,989
then was I think a thousand twenty four

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:20,139
bits so bad PGP to had a couple of

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:24,340
problems the first problem was that PGP

00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:26,680
to used RSA our say is the most common

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,150
use public key algorithm so I don't

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,930
explain what public key of course means

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,970
you go p-- you all know this the problem

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,010
with there was a patent on it in the US

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,560
only but the u.s. the main software

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:42,220
country and so you you don't want to

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,660
have this patent parent okay so he

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,260
couldn't really distribute this stuff

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:50,530
are except FA if he used a library or

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,650
from the errors incorporated of the so

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,780
called be safe library and he didn't

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,310
like that very much so there is an

00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,829
option with international version of PGP

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,859
to to to use a cool implementation a

00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:05,590
better implementation some of you might

00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:08,199
heard of be safe R is the only crypto

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,150
library which implemented the back D

00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,459
really back taught a random number

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,859
generator from the end from the NSA NSA

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:19,539
hey that's from this cover this company

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:23,620
which now is or has been bought by EMC I

00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:25,570
think this the taking problem was the

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,430
idea patent idea it's the symmetric

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,380
algorithm

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,660
for for the bike encryption this is

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,820
patented by Rick not a company of

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,949
persons from Switzerland and the patent

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,870
was valid most of the world with the

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:39,919
exception of I think Denmark Luxembourg

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,350
and a few of us small countries and the

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,060
people in Switzerland they wrote here

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,650
that you have to pay for the royalties

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,720
if you don't use it only for private

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,300
things and non private things means any

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,550
NGO was thought so

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:58,500
well you could ignore all this stuff

00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:01,110
mostly so for private use the real

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,430
problem was the export restriction this

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,840
is kind of the beginning of the crypto

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:09,870
Wars back in then in the 90s because the

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,199
US government said that all encryption

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:18,060
which is stronger than all about 40 bits

00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:23,970
so we in green encryption nothing a week

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:25,620
is kind of arms and so you can't use use

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,460
it you can't export it unless you get a

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:32,940
license for exporting this for some

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,410
reason this PGP leaked out via an FTP

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,780
server certain not really leak just

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:40,110
someone not downloaded from Europe from

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:44,190
US service so and because they uploaded

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:47,210
it once to an FTP server yet it was

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,940
confronted with Criminal Investigations

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:55,610
about about arms trafficking so really

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,610
hard things so that was not good

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,199
fortunately after a couple of years they

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,389
settled this and that is ok so what we

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,169
can't do him anything it's still not

00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:10,410
allowed to export this but well we can't

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,440
go after him and further founded a new

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,210
company to commercialize on this PGP to

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,539
thing because it was so interesting and

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,789
yeah in 96 we really had the intern in

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,930
the internet now well in Germany not

00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:28,410
really but in the u.s. definitely it had

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:32,280
more and more users he figured that real

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:36,740
good version of PGP or needs to be done

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:40,110
and so they come up with what was PGP 5

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,300
in spring 97 the

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,060
if you helman patent expired is another

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,940
patent which is also related to all this

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:53,069
public key stuff expired and at the same

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:56,460
time they released PGP five with the

00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:58,710
fear that there would be problems later

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,599
and you could not distribute anymore to

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:06,060
GPO for whatever we other reasons to

00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:08,039
John Kallis and someone decided that

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:14,159
they want to publish the format of PGP

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:16,349
PGP five and they did this by asking the

00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:18,449
IETF to file to charter a new working

00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:20,340
group the open PGP working group that

00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:26,250
was as a conference at ITF meeting in

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:28,560
Munich in 497 so well if you can read

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,000
that or however you later a PGP

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,710
collaborated was bought by Network

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,460
associated and later also other

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:38,580
companies currently it's owned by Simon

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,620
tech so well that's good that we have

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,300
that we have a free standard for this

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:47,130
though we know the format there's

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:51,449
nothing sweet secret and so we have in

00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:56,300
in 98 the open PGP specification was

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:59,550
published as RFC to four four zero and

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,039
well nine years later and the update was

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,430
done which included modern our

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,960
algorithms like char to UM which has

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,000
seen nice number four eight eight zero

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,259
and I wonder what the next number will

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,740
be okay let's see what's my involvement

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,509
in this I always wanted to meet Richard

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,060
Stallman just listened to one of his

00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:23,009
talks and the first opportunity back

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,419
then was at the immigrant Network

00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:30,440
Congress in Arlen in 97 in September and

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:33,599
well I think Richard spoke at the last

00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,000
somewhere there about current new

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,979
projects you may also notice that the

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,649
next day James bits offer for us I

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,990
incorporated talked say it was a very

00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:44,730
funny talk because they are a couple of

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,320
cryptograph was there and Richard

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,110
Stallman it was always interrupted

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,250
interrupted there

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:54,829
and well yes funny so the interesting

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:59,089
thing is in the session after the talk

00:08:54,829 --> 00:09:01,370
Richard asked us to write cryptographic

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,089
software because in use programmers

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,240
can't do that

00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:07,220
due to the export restrictions even not

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,720
if they are if they are living outside

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,209
of the GS as long as you have a

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,610
citizenship obviously as you as you are

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:16,070
a US citizen you could be accused of

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:19,420
arms trafficking and so on so the idea

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:22,550
was that for example Europe Asia people

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,800
I'm right good to software and then

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:30,110
export it to the yes so the u.s. import

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:33,740
is allowed yeah I found myself and later

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,779
in to look at this was wrong December I

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:40,339
think in November so I think allocate

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:42,500
rises so because we had this PGP to

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,420
which is claimed to be free software but

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,680
it has these problems of the patterns

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:51,560
and it's also not DFS G compatible and

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,930
this PDP five was playing proprietary so

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,630
it was open source in this all send of

00:09:53,930 --> 00:10:01,490
of source you could look at it but you

00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:02,899
were not allowed to modify this yeah

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:07,399
that also reason that we need a free

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:11,990
tool for this and so in December 97 iris

00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:14,149
G 10 as a free PGP to replacement which

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,699
had no patented algorithms and it was

00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:19,100
used as was designed as a UNIX tools so

00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:21,680
he could put it into a pipeline and he

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,240
it doesn't need any temporary flies for

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,839
this one so could she just pipe a pipe

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:32,600
lot of data straight and encrypt on the

00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:34,670
fly sheet an is a pun on the article of

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,959
the german constitution where article 10

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:41,420
says something about confidential of may

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,029
of mail and telecom telecommunications

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:47,060
the quote above is from the older

00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:50,240
version of our constitution in 1968 they

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:54,110
added a second paragraph of this which

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,320
put a lot of possibilities to

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,600
yeah don't adhere to this article

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,970
anymore so I thought is a good name and

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,700
we need technical support for this

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,730
article by the way of also little

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,630
experimental tool called g13 which

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,610
article 13 is about the privacy or

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,829
that's that you can live at your own

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,190
home and it's a state may not go into

00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:18,230
this

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:22,820
that's for disk encryption what that's

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:26,209
only in something playing well g10 our

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,060
so I asked the MSF because a PGP to

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:30,620
replacement was on that house list

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,680
ask them whether they want to use or I

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,560
want to have my code and I assign

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,480
copyright and we changed in a name to

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,910
something cooler than g10 because that's

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,880
basically only something a job could

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:46,040
understand or well Peter Goodman and it

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,220
was the first one to to ask me whether

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:55,190
this is about this article so yeah we

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,230
knew PG and at the same time so when I

00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,270
wrote this the open PGP working group

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,730
was founded but the development

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:04,430
overlapped a bit because the first weeks

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,350
I was not aware of this um so we later

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:10,279
changed the protocols write my own

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:13,040
additions to G tan choose a new one from

00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:18,820
open PGP so that wasn't spring 98 to get

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:24,020
a new name and I think in autumn 998

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:28,730
version 1 was released on so the initial

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:32,600
version of G tan new PG or G tan I used

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:35,440
eros just el-gamal encryption which is

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,930
defilement algorithm instead of RSA and

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,089
it used Blowfish which was this famous

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,430
algorithm back then because it was

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:48,829
printed in brush nighas applied

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:51,140
cryptography yeah and well there was an

00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:53,180
idea plugin for PGP compatibility and as

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,610
a plugin arm which was taught on a

00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,800
Danish server then it was basically I

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,399
wrote it first just to are to test

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,209
whether the rest of the format worked

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,339
but that's not anymore

00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:06,529
so the open PGP later in spring are

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:08,360
changed things so we use DSA for

00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:12,649
signatures

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:16,250
and elgamal for encryption then this was

00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:18,770
the introduction of the primary key and

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,600
the subkeys we arrived so we have on our

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,180
fingerprints is only about the primary

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,279
key and the rest is the sub key and we

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,320
can choose up he easily without breaking

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:32,200
the web of trust which is important for

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,200
us Debian guys and many geeks

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,970
well the RS a patent expired finally end

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,800
of 2000 but the company just recently

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,010
the public domain a couple months before

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,250
that also we added RSA in September and

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:54,459
some time after it our I said to be 3/4

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:56,839
algorithm for various reasons the

00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,880
blowfish was not continued a symmetric

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,790
algorithm back then but we use triple

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,360
des which is old old but very well

00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:07,310
researched algorithm and everybody has a

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,130
lot of confident confident in this

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,990
algorithm so this was used and cast 5

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:23,959
which is a more modern thing and faster

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:26,750
was used back then some may asked what's

00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:30,110
the relationship between qu PG and PGP

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:33,500
cooperation so obviously I never looked

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,180
at PGP 5 code because its propriety I

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,940
couldn't do this and would taint the

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:41,570
group eg code but I worked with hal

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:44,900
finis unfortunately died 2 years 2 years

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,360
ago was a very great hacker and John

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:50,450
Kallis I worked with back use them to do

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,040
Interop testing or test new features for

00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:56,240
example the integration of the two fish

00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:00,890
a gruesome even before the before the

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,170
RAS we know was we have the AES AES has

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:06,130
been as we know then so we assumed maybe

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,390
it will be two fish so we added two fish

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,430
and for the reason that it's more modern

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,940
algorithm and it has a larger block

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:17,120
length so for the state-of-the-art so

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,630
we're quite a good relationship and that

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,900
was it

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,410
umm so it turned out that people had a

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,879
lot of

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:27,620
and GPG I thought okay so I stopped

00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:29,629
doing all this estrogen all data

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,440
conversion stuff and whatever you do as

00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:37,129
freelancer then and I'll try to do some

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:41,810
support for GPG and work on new versions

00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:44,990
maybe so I found that the company g10

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:50,810
code in 2001 with the help of my brother

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:53,180
who's the other shareholder and we get

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,160
along with her with two partner

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,370
companies which is interprets Union or

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:04,550
snap work and Kate up from kte company

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:07,339
so in my tears color dilemma we offer

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:12,319
something and the BSI which is the

00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:14,810
German Federal Security office they are

00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:17,600
they are their office and they want more

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,420
they wanted to have was s/mime as free

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,149
as a non-us implementation because they

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,589
don't want to use a s/mime in Outlook or

00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,810
anything and they were on the way to

00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:34,639
change the internal stuff or from

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:36,920
Windows to dbn and KDE might be

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,939
interesting stories so it wasn't clear

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,370
whether this thing would be a glue PG

00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:46,670
but our first try was to implement this

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,050
as an extension to Mozilla so we before

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,029
before we offer that we talked about

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,670
muscle on the Mozilla Corporation and

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:54,920
offer them we do this for you we changed

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,310
your very basic s/mime implementation

00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,130
which wouldn't fit any yeah you couldn't

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,050
be used in Germany for official

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,620
encryption I will change it make it

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,559
really good

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:09,319
but for whatever reasons they rejected

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,650
that we won't use your code we won't we

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:16,760
won't put it into any into what it calls

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:19,189
NSS I think so so we gave up on this and

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:24,409
instead I to implement ESMA myself in

00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:29,570
group eg which is not GPG per GB GSM was

00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:31,429
a lot of tasks and but anyway there's

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:35,160
also the opportunity to do something

00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:38,370
right and what I what I did was to split

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,400
Viji from one monolithic implementation

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,320
into one basically from two models one

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,290
is called the GPG agent who takes care

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,720
of the private key and only like it's

00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,010
similar like a smart card and GPG who

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,690
does a bollock encryption and all this

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,280
web of trusts up and everything which is

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,700
not that important so important is that

00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,120
you that you can be sure that the secret

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:03,330
key or the private key word calls is

00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,280
secured in with the idea that you can

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,080
separate separate it on a different

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,060
account or use it even on a different

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,420
machine so it took long until this

00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:16,680
really was was implementing but the

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:21,210
design was model and was more future

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,710
proof it wasn't separated T the crypto

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,830
start the low-level crypto stuff which

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,260
was the birth of Phillip Jacobs because

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,810
it could be used at for other things too

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,010
and it was anyway easier and we

00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:38,400
introduced GPG me as a standard API for

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:40,500
encryption so now our deviant community

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,020
so it might be interesting what deviant

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,290
to do with me G as you can see two

00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:50,340
months after the very first release our

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:56,820
James or uploaded the first thing stolen

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:59,520
named g10 and well yeah in 2000 I was

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,180
asked to implement a smaller tool and

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,970
attitudinal PG to make it easier to

00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:10,980
verify signatures so that depicted you

00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:14,190
pay pkg I can do package can verify the

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,770
signatures of the package so this was in

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,890
2000 but it took four more years until

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:22,610
the old release signing really really

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:25,380
broke and was in was in was integrated

00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:29,450
also in 2000 fear the first version of

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:32,610
QP g2 was packaged and into experimental

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:36,170
I'm thinking in the next year or it was

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:39,030
also available in the next release oh

00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:41,250
yeah you're probably not the right crowd

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,500
for this but Windows is unfortunately

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:47,550
important and the Debian installer also

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,809
supports Windows so I did in well in the

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,700
first year I didn't

00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:56,039
two windows of DBG are very basic and

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:59,340
then we had a new German government who

00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:01,019
are tilt that crypto will not be

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,360
regulated because it's important for the

00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,970
economy that it's not regulated so no

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,019
crypto Wars no export regulation

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:11,669
whatever and they gave a grant to do

00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:15,090
something to show this and this grant

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:19,350
was used to finalize the part of Windows

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:22,789
and also thought SIA field which is the

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:26,460
predecessor or fork well of close mail

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:28,529
to Windows and a lot of other things

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,690
like the GPA and all the stuff was done

00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:33,659
by the thing we learned a lot from this

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:38,570
very first public grant for to write

00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:38,570
crypto free software even free software

00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:45,659
later this was very basic so and later

00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:49,220
in 2000 X we published in installer gbg4

00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:51,539
win actually again ordered by the BSI

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,669
they wanted to have that the citizens

00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,700
are able to come to send them stuff

00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,559
encrypted in open PGP and not as my

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,990
because nobody wanted to use as my more

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,929
it was the outward stuff didn't work and

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:09,509
you to pay for your certificate and yeah

00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:15,350
group eg to was actually not designed to

00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:17,759
report it but then add a bit of time and

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,610
was in need of a project and there was a

00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,369
health project here in the Manheim Hydra

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:27,299
back area all right to do something and

00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:31,379
they are ordered the part of group eg to

00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:37,799
to Windows so it was quite interesting

00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:40,440
and yeah we did it then and yeah well we

00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:44,070
have a surprising high number of users

00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,859
of nuclear on Windows probably

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:49,529
I know all Deborah unknown and other

00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:52,559
Linux in Lingus distributions use it but

00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:56,009
you don't notice it's really but when

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,479
Windows resolve the main missile a main

00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:59,479
operating system yeah

00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:08,850
now what's today first of all we have

00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:16,229
this new PG one the old one and group eg

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:19,519
- the new one arm but in 2000 I changed

00:22:16,229 --> 00:22:21,749
a lot of things on English II - and

00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:25,489
worked on it and it took a long time

00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:29,849
until until last November when I reached

00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:32,129
2.1 so they have been a couple of better

00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:34,470
releases but not really tested by people

00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:35,580
by people so the idea was I will release

00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,979
it to a 2.10

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,830
and then wait for the back reports have

00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:44,460
come in and then fix it so at currently

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:49,559
we had 2.17 and there is now is a

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:52,919
monthly monthly monthly release so we

00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:55,649
are adding the last features and dkg is

00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,129
actively putting into in experimental

00:22:55,649 --> 00:23:01,139
and I think we are a good good way that

00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:06,749
- that one will eventually be a was

00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:09,539
funded GPG on DBM yes so all things we

00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:12,479
do is - that one - to zero which is

00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,409
labeled stable it's just in maintenance

00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:16,859
motive

00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:18,840
sometimes we pop things back there and

00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:22,859
fix things and particular to make it

00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:25,320
easier to migrate you to that one but

00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:28,320
there's not much what we can do that

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,529
except of course for fixing bugs and

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,799
critical bugs and sometimes crew -

00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:41,789
problems and and that's of course our

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:44,220
PGP no DPG 4.1 now 1.4 which is classic

00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:46,859
people really like this there are still

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:50,909
people out there who like to use PGP -

00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:52,559
encrypted files and send the exploration

00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:54,509
of the Earth's our algorithm and the

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,360
idea I was made it is actually possible

00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:57,670
to easy

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,880
do this with one not four and so they

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:03,160
they want to still want to do do this

00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,640
instead of always carrying this old code

00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,580
within 2.1 in current master the

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:17,530
decision or the decision was to do this

00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:20,260
only into the into that in 1.4 so we

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:24,309
will maintain one not for indefinitely

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:29,110
properly for this altar and for systems

00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:34,559
where you can't build group eg two very

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:34,559
rare things I think Dom but it happens

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:42,040
so in two thousand art the working group

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,540
for OpenPGP was concluded because there

00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,250
was nothing to do anymore and we wanted

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:51,820
to wait for the outcome of this chart

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:54,400
dry a3 competition that happened

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:57,280
sometime later and two months ago the

00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,580
working was was we shouted to update

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,919
open PGP thanks and our plan is to have

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,799
a rough consensus on next month on what

00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:08,710
we actually want to do it will be a only

00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:12,429
a little update office come to this game

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:14,470
that will be an internet draft and one

00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:16,240
in February and we hope to a final call

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:20,740
which means it goes to the editor and

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:24,480
and our C will be released in a year so

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:28,510
she kg for example is a year why he's

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:32,650
yeah he's sharing sharing the working

00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:36,360
group elephants so girls are yeah we

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:41,980
want to have new elliptic curve there

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:44,140
the CFR G is discussing for close to two

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,320
years now what new curves are to be used

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,630
and not the NIS t curves and there will

00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,580
be a there will be probably two or four

00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:55,600
curves which should be used by ITF

00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:58,360
protocols and so we will see how to

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,830
implement them in OPP and whether they

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,030
are master gross on these things and

00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:07,059
another important thing is that we need

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:09,080
authentication encryption what we do

00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:13,010
that this means that that you

00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,130
detect that the encrypted message has

00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:18,050
been tampered with so it's not about

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:20,120
disrupting but that in tempering we have

00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,670
been a protection against this which is

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,590
which works which is which is good it

00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,420
just it works but it's not what

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,810
cryptographers want and it is slow

00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:32,350
because you run say as over it and again

00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:37,210
sha-1 or you could do it much faster and

00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:39,500
more safe so with modern algorithm modes

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,530
that is something we want to discuss in

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,470
this working group then of course we

00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:47,000
need to revise the algorithms which I

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,270
wasn't should be implemented which would

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,930
not be implemented for example md5 it's

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:57,140
entirely broken so it should not be used

00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:59,900
or it must not be used and definitely

00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,060
properly AES will replace Triple DES so

00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:06,380
because we have a lot of trust in this

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:09,260
modern algorithms and well we need a new

00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:12,200
fingerprint paternalism to be prepared

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:15,620
for problems we will eventually see in

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,720
sha Wan sha-1 is the current standard or

00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,330
not anymore well until a few years it

00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,970
was a current standard it wasn't but it

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,940
has some weaknesses and over time the

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:28,580
weaknesses will just get worse and so we

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:31,610
need to prepare for this and we want to

00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:37,700
have a new way to compute fingerprints

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:39,860
so more safe main topic is of course

00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:44,840
elliptic curve cryptography which is

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:47,210
more elliptic curve cryptography is the

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,180
modern algorithm it doesn't use its nose

00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,730
RSA but a different problem and it has a

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:56,210
nice property that with smaller numbers

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:58,610
you can you can reach the same security

00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:03,380
level as with a very large as a key so

00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:05,450
it's it's really nice it doesn't need so

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,870
long computations and they seem so you

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:11,960
want to have this there is RFC 63 7

00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:15,260
which describes how to use open PG open

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,740
PGP and elliptic curves this defines

00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:20,510
NISD curves but it also allows to use

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,940
other curves for example brain pool or

00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:29,960
recently implemented on this graph

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:31,730
of two five one nine this has been

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,220
implement as this RFC has been written

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:37,100
by an employee of semantics but on

00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:45,440
suggestion from Phil from Fitz Immelman

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:47,690
the original inventor of PGP this is

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,900
good we really want to want want to have

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:53,900
this and Andrey implemented the code

00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,270
also in blue PG so we modified it later

00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,880
a bit but the original code is is for is

00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:01,010
from him and it's it's okay it's okay

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,330
it's fine it's a fine implementation it

00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:08,230
works or one nice but these groups are

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:11,200
some people don't like it anymore

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,790
probably for a good reason because

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,580
algorithms curve selection has to do a

00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:18,710
lot with trust and if there is no

00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:22,480
transparency how the curves so the

00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:25,790
parameters hold actually shape is or

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,440
it's so it's a way of trust and nobody

00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:31,190
trusts and iced here anymore after the

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,590
Snowden revelations and if not before so

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:36,230
maybe there's nothing edit so they're

00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:38,480
just fine but there anyway hard to use

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:42,470
correctly and so there are other way

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,020
other things we want to use and what we

00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,380
are using what we definitely want to

00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,570
support in new PG or we actually support

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:55,280
curve two five one nine in two variants

00:29:50,570 --> 00:30:00,100
is well EDA is a adverts coughing that's

00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:02,900
assigning with it that's implemented in

00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,120
2.2 one seven and two to one in all in

00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:09,590
all versions and you can actually use it

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,200
after we tells you our it's not yet open

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,750
PGP compatible because open PGP does not

00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,690
allow this but we have some gentlemen

00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:21,200
agreement that while we will it will

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:26,090
work and we can do this and be able son

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:28,220
a few days ago he finally implemented

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,700
curve to five have won nine for

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,120
encryption

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:35,690
there's only lip decrypt missing we have

00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,159
no release for the precooked 1.7

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:41,419
which has needed features for the

00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:44,269
scissors will come shortly on so

00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:55,870
basically we can use two 5.19 this one

00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:58,789
sank off of for now yeah so just a few

00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:02,809
won't tell you about it one feature all

00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:05,360
those remote use of jpg and the idea is

00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:07,850
the opener or sometimes you have your

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,730
server and you have a large file there

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,389
for example DVD image there and you want

00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,820
to sign it

00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:18,379
well I'll practically group what I do as

00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:19,970
they just run sha-256 um on it put it

00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:22,070
that's in the file and finds that file

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,440
so using this n-direction that is what

00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:28,039
what deviant even that's what package

00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,960
resigning but that's a bit odd yeah back

00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,419
actually be could you you could do it

00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,360
differently so but you don't want to

00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:37,850
download the entire the entire file for

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,519
several gigs to your machine signed it

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,679
and uploaded it and that's no that's not

00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:45,549
going to work and what you can also do

00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,289
is to decrypt the file on the server

00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:52,269
using your key on your own machine so

00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:55,370
and your key on your own machine is

00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:56,960
safer with not on the server and it

00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,120
could also be a smart card which is

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,779
actually a little bit more safer than

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:10,059
and there's a nice feature and with the

00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:13,700
release of OpenSSH 6.7 ssh loss

00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:16,940
redirection of arbitrary you local

00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:19,700
sockets and we use this feature to put

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,610
GPG agent on the one side and gbg on the

00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:26,840
other side and connect between between

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:29,120
them and so that is basically the same

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,669
thing as a smart card on young on your

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,710
on your desktop it's separated your keys

00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:38,149
are saved there and on the other side is

00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,549
GPG and doing the bike encrypt the

00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:43,600
decryption the bike signing and this

00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:46,309
stuff which requires a private key so

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,389
there will be a pop-up this pin entry

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,429
thing where you enter your passphrase

00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:51,970
and if

00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:54,309
it's redirected it was the display that

00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:57,549
that this request comes from a remote

00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:59,799
host this is what you what you see if

00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:02,379
you redirect the socket given move the

00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,960
GPT edge knowledge extra socket and

00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:07,600
later later I figured that it would be

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,549
nice to do the same from from the

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,909
browser in case browser implements in

00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:15,549
JavaScript for example of jpg or open

00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:18,580
PGP decryption and it could just connect

00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:21,759
to a local socket redirect it or someone

00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,529
to think what rosa socket and then GPG

00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,519
engine would do exactly the same only

00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:29,710
tear stringless then are the broader

00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:34,320
requested that this key should be used

00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:39,309
them I think that's a nice feature

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:42,940
yeah okay back to non-technical things

00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:45,909
it's you've heard that I had some

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:49,749
problems to pay my salary and make a

00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:53,860
life of it for a couple of years now to

00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:56,759
delay layoffs Marcos bring man who was

00:33:53,860 --> 00:34:00,009
with me here for more than ten years and

00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:02,379
so fortunately the Linux Foundation this

00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:05,740
year granted me five thousand dollars a

00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:08,169
month to work on new PG from the core

00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,450
infrastructure initiative because I feel

00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:15,849
it's an important thing I'm very glad

00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:19,450
about this the baton became this Pro

00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:22,450
Publica article in February which told

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:25,450
the general public about that this new

00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:26,829
PG thing and that is why he wants to

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:31,210
give up on this because he has not

00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:33,040
enough money and so in the end it was we

00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:36,040
received about three hundred kilo euros

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,760
on donations so the accounts are full

00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:42,220
right now and very interesting the most

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,760
interesting fact is that that there's

00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:48,280
more than two hundred twenty thousand

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,929
euros from individual donations so

00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,659
people really care about this and I'm

00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:56,040
very glad that that we received so much

00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:58,630
are so many donations from individuals

00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,970
because this also means that there is no

00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,619
dependency on a large company

00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:05,530
for example there is also stripe on

00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:08,619
Facebook were granted 550 thousand

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:10,750
dollars each which is good which is nice

00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:13,750
but it's also weighed out by that in

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:17,380
with individuals and so there they can't

00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:20,290
turn us into a certain direction

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:23,650
yeah but really nice it's again fun to

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:25,240
work on the new PG yeah you might have

00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:28,150
noticed there's no donation campaign no

00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,340
our please donate right now there's a

00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:32,980
simple reason we have enough money for

00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:37,270
this year and my company which analyst

00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:42,280
is a probe for-profit company and we

00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:44,050
can't put put the money all these money

00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,270
back for the next year to pay pay them

00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:48,570
so we have some text issues there to

00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:51,160
solve and the solution will be that I

00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:53,590
turned my company into a non-profit so

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,560
and it minded see I'm behalf was a

00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:59,140
German yeah so it was in the US it's a

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,970
big company so it's it is not designed

00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:07,960
to make profit but take care of

00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:12,250
infrastructure things also for other

00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:15,490
crypto projects maybe so I always say at

00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:17,740
this point that it would really read a

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,470
lot of like that about this Republican

00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:24,460
article and anything and that these open

00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:26,980
SSL problem two years ago

00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,480
raised the attention to the problems we

00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,330
have of our infrastructure that it

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,570
relies on too and not enough people so

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,490
that it's not financed properly so there

00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:39,760
are still a lot of other projects who

00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:42,010
really suffer and they they work work on

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,460
things all day you know in the evenings

00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:46,990
or then it's something to do the Linux

00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,890
Foundation is doing something about this

00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:58,060
trying to but it's it's a huge task to

00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:58,960
get these things straight so what to do

00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,740
with all this money

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,220
I had a new war field for Maldivian

00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:09,339
maintain our he did a lot of work on the

00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:12,220
hurt part along with Marcos and he

00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:14,480
finished his PhD recently and so it was

00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:18,230
glad to get a job working

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,180
only on free software um yeah so he's

00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,980
looking at the code ask me questions

00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,410
I'll write this and it's kind of doing

00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:27,580
an audit or to get accustomed to the

00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:29,540
code so that there is real

00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,640
stacking developer who can do em

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:35,360
everything what I can do right now so we

00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,130
can't rely on just one guy and in case

00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,920
the I'm hit by a bus

00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:42,410
that there is not a period of several

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,570
months or javi you so until others can

00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:48,890
catch up with this thing so I think it's

00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:51,950
really important so neighbor son is also

00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:53,660
here and yes for a couple of years is

00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:58,700
working on new PG in particular smart

00:37:53,660 --> 00:38:00,260
cards and it has very good work and so I

00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,330
really like this that I can just

00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,970
delegate all smart card stuff and and

00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:07,700
and teasing and also ECC starts or

00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:11,270
elliptic curve things so it's out to him

00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:13,580
and so we agree that he does some

00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:17,120
contractual work for this so he's living

00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:21,820
in Japan so there is no way to employ

00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:25,490
him right ah yeah that's cool and

00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:28,580
recently I have a guy called Kaimuki

00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:32,570
Ellis perhaps indicating a part time

00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:34,610
only so he has only not enough time so

00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:37,010
it's hard to find people who just want

00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:40,880
to work for work for money on on a

00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:43,630
certain faster anak male is very

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:48,310
important because it's if you read about

00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:53,630
encryption they always say I use I stove

00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:56,180
from the bird and the Nick mail and yeah

00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:58,160
buddy Nick Mel is the Patrick from

00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,750
enigmail he is actually no time it does

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,600
a really nice pair time and is other

00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:06,470
things to do and because so it's they

00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:08,630
need all the help they can get so kai is

00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:12,110
working helping them a bit so maybe we

00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:14,480
can add more later on this and well yeah

00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:18,980
I also raised my salary to something

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,780
more acceptable from IT guy yeah so my

00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,790
family is very glad about this and you

00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,270
will see me more often going to on

00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,270
vacation

00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:31,420
but special things so we have David Shaw

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,510
David Shaw joined us after the export

00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:38,319
restriction in the US were keys so that

00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:40,290
was in 2001 or until 2000 and he could

00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:42,910
start work on a group eg he mainly

00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:45,160
implemented the modern web of trust what

00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:48,700
we have in GPG and all kind of other

00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,770
stuff even if he has time he worked

00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:55,000
works and this is mainly responsible or

00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:56,650
responsible Inc in quotes offer for GPG

00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,440
classic one not for because he knows it

00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,000
very well so then we have Marcus

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,130
Brinkman were already told that he

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,510
worked for 10 years on are always things

00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:14,980
and you see recently joint is and looked

00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:16,599
as the decrypt actually after I lifted

00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,609
the requirement for having a copyright

00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:20,650
assignment and he started to work on

00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:23,799
elliptic ripped and elliptic decrypt is

00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:26,230
now very very fast or partly faster than

00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:30,690
openness open SSL are due to all the

00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:33,549
assembler stuff he did and yeah what

00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:37,750
really cool he also already implemented

00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:40,480
shall three moving in two days so really

00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,710
nice hope I meet him sometime he'll then

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,619
is under Heineken

00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:48,490
these days are takes care of the windows

00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:51,280
tough to GP g 4g p g4 win and cleopatra

00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:53,680
from KDE and these things and we have a

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,230
lot of Debian folks over the time worked

00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:00,280
on group eg packaging and file impacts

00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:02,049
or and that nagging me to look at this

00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,750
back report again and doing fixes and

00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:12,910
missing so many cents of them and all

00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:16,510
the donors and viewers and so yeah yeah

00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:20,470
what comes next we have this Nolan thing

00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:22,780
in 2013 which convinced me that I don't

00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:25,359
get I should not give up on crypto stuff

00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,130
and just help people or the next

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:31,059
generation to have at least some tools

00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:33,220
to protect them a bit but the problem we

00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:35,380
have of group eg is it's only for geeks

00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,420
it does not really work though even the

00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:40,030
web of trust try to explain it

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:42,549
to turn to hectic us how the web of

00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,730
trust really works it's very very hard

00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:47,500
to do this so it it is not nothing we

00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:52,119
can use for a for for a tool which would

00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,680
be available everywhere so it not good

00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:58,420
on this key signing parties are they are

00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:00,099
nice but it's not technically a good

00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,920
thing to do so because you can't join

00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:06,430
this and that so our new default focus

00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:12,400
will be I know that there are some

00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:15,790
people who don't like it but well we

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,890
have the NS a and B and D and well well

00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:23,250
as it's just doing massive violence and

00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:27,250
we should give the people the power to

00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:31,079
account to count resistant so massive

00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:35,650
violence is what we want what we want to

00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:37,680
help against with GPG and not targeted

00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:39,430
our text because targeted attacks is

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,160
something different you

00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:45,700
it's the it is not sufficient to just

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,069
use GPG but you also have to secure your

00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:53,020
machine and then look at this and don't

00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:57,900
you Skype and what and take care if you

00:42:53,020 --> 00:43:00,430
install iceweasel or or certain versions

00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,079
and in all these things to secure

00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:05,190
machine that that's much that's that's

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:07,299
so hot that's so hot so I I don't know

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:11,319
only few people can do this really

00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:12,970
really good so and we want to make it

00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:17,770
easy to use basically it should be

00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:21,280
mostly invisible but of course there is

00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:23,290
a huge community users GPG are for

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,530
serious more all thoughts a serious

00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:28,990
purpose user for four tasks which are

00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:30,609
dangerous and they really need a very

00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:32,380
good and strong choreography real

00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:35,020
computer security computer security and

00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:38,410
we we want definitely want to support

00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:40,720
them still the only question is what to

00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:43,450
do with the options and I think it's

00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,380
easier to tell the people or really are

00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:49,390
threatened it by police or something

00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,810
they need to take care of of men of many

00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,670
things so is easier

00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:56,000
for them to just make sure that they

00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:59,660
change one option to turn it again in

00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:04,880
the x-star paranoid secure mode then to

00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:07,220
do this for all people I skip this as a

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,140
enable tall or something which become

00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:11,300
the new naming system is a good

00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,990
opportunity to I'll do something new

00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:16,850
like the web of trust that it's

00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:19,340
something what to do and very important

00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:23,630
is this trust on first you thing which

00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:25,580
is basically the c qh l trust model so

00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:30,680
if you want ever had a connection once

00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:33,170
we remember this and we only put a big

00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,580
warning up if this changes so if there's

00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,270
a man in the middle at that point and

00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:41,990
this is what should eventually be the

00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:44,330
default trust model in GPG so that it

00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:46,910
can be used by everyone and it's locally

00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:49,090
locally store to whom we had contact and

00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:52,490
no need for web of trusting and

00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:54,020
explaining it's better than not

00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:59,390
encrypting so it helps against meso

00:44:54,020 --> 00:45:01,100
violence I skipped it gbg missing so to

00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:04,850
that zero will reach end-of-life

00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:06,260
properly in December two years other

00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:08,320
won't because there won't be any back

00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,880
port or easy though easy C to this and

00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,280
to that one will be released our end of

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,470
this year L to the two so to that one

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,690
I'm doing couple of releases now and

00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:23,330
then it will be declared a stable and

00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:25,310
maintained as to the two and new

00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:27,380
development in particularly what what

00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:29,810
goes what the outcome of the open PGP

00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:34,100
working group will be implemented in and

00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:36,590
new things like to the three and so yes

00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,300
so we have two two will soon be the

00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:41,240
standard version on Windows and

00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:45,140
hopefully also Debian we have a very

00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,460
solid development team and our goal is

00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,490
to making master violence really

00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:52,670
expensive for those doing this

00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:52,670
thank you

00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:12,230
I don't know whether there's time for

00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:14,900
questions probably free I have some a

00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:16,940
few times for questions then please cure

00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,990
if you want to ask questions please

00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,990
queue up at the microphone

00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:42,650
well do whatever you want so nobody has

00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:45,590
any questions well okay so I believe

00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:48,460
we'll be around the next until Wednesday

00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:52,300
I can break the ice it's always right

00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:56,300
have you had a look at the leap project

00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:58,100
it's people working mainly and it's a

00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,010
two-part project from what I understood

00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,750
and the first one was implementing

00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:05,150
OpenVPN easily like one button click and

00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:08,450
then it works what a VPN and but they're

00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:10,610
working also for a complete GPG out of

00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:12,500
the box working so any user wouldn't

00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:16,520
have to touch all the details about it

00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:18,560
and using tofu to I don't know if you've

00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,570
looked at their proposals and the work

00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,970
they've done I know that there are a lot

00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:25,160
of projects doing things but I frankly I

00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:27,650
don't have the really overview but about

00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:34,010
this so and I've not been approached

00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:35,720
directly and if you send me mails or so

00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:39,500
please make sure that there's no HTML

00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:44,810
and this mail so also not alternative

00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:48,020
things regarding the trust on first use

00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:50,510
domain SSH is moving to SSH FPE with the

00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:55,940
help of DNS SEC they're the same thing

00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:58,190
happening on GPG e 2.3 maybe I the NSA

00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:01,580
yeah well that's a different topic so

00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:05,510
where it's along well we have a lot of

00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:08,030
lot of mechanisms on GPG are ready to to

00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:10,370
retrieve the key and there's also this

00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:12,740
PKA system which can do basically the

00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:14,660
same what think on it can do and things

00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:18,290
so we're discovering things I know

00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:20,390
Daniel is strongly against using DNS for

00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:22,670
key log up so but there are other

00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:27,350
opportunities to do this like like using

00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:29,090
using a web server and all these things

00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:31,580
need to be discussed in the next time

00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:33,740
but I think tofu is something we really

00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,450
really want to have because it keeps the

00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:39,200
decentralization of PGP

00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:40,089
and I say PvP because PDP was designed

00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,530
to be

00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:45,140
decent decentralized and we don't want

00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:47,210
to have any centralization again we have

00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,609
some kind of centralization because

00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:51,470
there are mail providers we need to get

00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:53,990
some mail addresses so yes but that's

00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:56,300
something we need to live off but from

00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:59,270
from my point of view we should try to

00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:02,530
be mostly sent decentralized so that we

00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:06,170
don't rely on a single point of failure

00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:07,180
hi so I think I'm the Daniel he was

00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:09,800
referring to

00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:11,300
so just to be I want to clarify I

00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,920
actually have no objection with looking

00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,349
information up in the DNS I just don't

00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,240
want us to rely on centralized authority

00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:19,640
and if the DNS happens to be an

00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,380
additional corroborated Authority I have

00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,790
no objection to that so I wanted just to

00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,230
say thank you and then I really

00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,150
appreciate your focus both on the

00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,680
decentralization and the increasing

00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:29,089
focus on user experience I think those

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,930
are really important things and what

00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:30,920
you've done in the past is really

00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,359
important and I'm looking forward to

00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,589
working with you more on the stuff that

00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:36,349
I think will continue to be important in

00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:39,320
the future so thank you yeah yeah I mean

00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:42,980
you have a yeah you have a you have a

00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:45,230
point with the DNA with the DNS and it's

00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,170
something to discuss from my point of

00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:49,940
DNS was well it's an established that

00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,440
replicated distributed database and so

00:49:49,940 --> 00:50:01,400
while it's easy to use and better than

00:49:51,440 --> 00:50:04,430
nothing and but so thanks anyone else so

00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,930
I stay here until Wednesday and if if

00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,240
there's somebody in the other room we

00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:15,560
can stream your questions so that also

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:17,720
works just so you know okay so well

00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,369
anyway you're all using the GPG user for

00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,089
a long time so thank you for attending

00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:22,089
again and

00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:34,890
