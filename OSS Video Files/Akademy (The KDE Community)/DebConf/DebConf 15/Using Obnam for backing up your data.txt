Obnam is an easy, secure backup program. It de-duplicates data, and encrypts it locally before transferring the backup data to a remote server over sftp. It supports a FUSE filesystem for restoring data using normal file management tool 

This talk shows how Obnam is used in various cases, and covers both basic and advanced use.

hello everybody the next talk will be

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,420
very large with seniors about back up

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,420
using op Nam for backing up your data

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:26,490
hello everyone hello so this is a fairly

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,599
short talk and I suspect there will not

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:34,020
be enough time for any interactive Q&A

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:37,980
but if you go on IRCTC dotnet and on the

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,239
hash oblem channel I will answer

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,820
questions there later

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,239
or you can come last ask me questions

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:52,039
afterwards if I happen to look like I'm

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:56,699
not running away many years ago in about

00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,379
2004 I had a week and then I realize

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,920
that I haven't done a proper back up for

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,120
a long time I had I think three

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,640
computers at home

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,670
all of which contained various bits of

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,909
live data and it was really tedious to

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,490
do a proper backup so a group went and

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:20,820
bought a stack of CDs and I started

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:23,070
running some script to make backups and

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,090
then I started verifying their CDs and

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:31,610
maybe one in five of them failed this

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:34,320
was not fun it took all weekend

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:38,100
and this is obviously why I didn't

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,630
actually make backups very often yes

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,350
there was a time when I didn't do the

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,579
cops very often and then I start

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,079
rethinking what what can I do

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:51,570
differently some people suggested that

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,720
hey you should buy a tape drive and I

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,750
said very dirty words to them

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,640
I don't like dead crabs other people do

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,920
and that's fine I don't care I could

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,780
switch from CDs to DVDs which will be

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,430
that immediate cost goes up what I have

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,810
many fear of them but even then it was

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,620
clear to me that I would need several

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,220
dignity

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:21,780
and the number would go up very soon so

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:24,569
I decided to look at switching to hard

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,019
drives and I did some calculations and

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,910
hard drives where where or had just

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:34,049
become so cheap that this was feasible

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,519
for me obviously hard drives have a

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:38,819
problem that eventually you need water

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,519
bond and you start having parts of hard

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:45,750
drives but at least it's easier to copy

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,849
data over to a new drive you can mount

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:53,760
all of them as one file system and then

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:58,739
just copy I did not find a good program

00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:02,760
for backing up to hard drives

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:05,819
I looked for about two years and and

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,280
looked at various choices and I wanted

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,230
to have some of those drives in

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,530
different locations over the network so

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,299
these brought on complications so I

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,280
didn't start out to write a backup

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,760
program but that was a that is what I

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,630
ended doing one of the issues I had

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,450
worked at the existing backup software

00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:29,190
was written for tape drives and they

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:34,680
were treating hard drives as virtual

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:39,989
tape drives makes no sense to me there

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:42,410
were a few features I wanted and one of

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:45,030
them was that I wanted snapshots I

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,700
wanted wanted every backup generation

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,989
every individual backup run to be a

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,329
snapshot of all of my large data and so

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:57,079
that I could decide to pick and choose

00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:01,620
which ones I keep and I start throwing

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:07,079
expiring backups I did not want to have

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:09,269
to say restore generation 4 and then

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,579
meaning I have to restore first

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,250
generation 1 and then apply a delta from

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,979
generation 2 and then a delta from

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,150
generation 3 from four before I get what

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:22,550
I want I'm to go where I go and that's

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,410
all I want to happen

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:29,850
since I wanted to host my backups

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:31,770
elsewhere at least some of my backups

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,610
elsewhere I wanted to have encryption

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,890
and I wanted to have encryption that is

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,670
done locally on my computer before it

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:44,160
leaves the computer there were programs

00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:47,520
that did this but they lacked some of

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,070
the other features since I'm doing

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,160
online backups and his hard drives back

00:04:50,070 --> 00:05:00,270
in 2005 ish were still very very

00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:02,600
expensive to see jerk I wanted to have

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:07,080
deduplication I don't want to transfer

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,790
data over a 100 megabit ADSL line over

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,890
and over again if it's already on the

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:16,770
remote and I want to reuse that bit of

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:21,030
data and I don't want to have to spend

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:25,680
huge amounts of effort to get this to

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:28,800
bark in a previous life in in the 90s I

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:34,380
was tasked to set up Amanda in our

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:37,500
office network and this was not fun any

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,140
backup solution that requires me to read

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:44,760
more than one page of instructions is

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:50,270
basically lost I'm getting too old for

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:53,940
it in manuals oblem does all of those

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,930
things now it's taken a while because I

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,640
write op them in my free time but it's

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,690
masters now he has a few other things

00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,820
that are slightly interesting as well it

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,820
has a fuse plug-in which means that you

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,790
can mount your backups and then look at

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,560
them as if they were a directory tree

00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,260
every backup generation is a separate

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:22,200
directory and you can look at any of the

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:24,510
massive Esch a great manual it's not one

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:29,900
I would read but it has a read this

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,900
first section that is very very short

00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:34,799
I brought automated test Suites which

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,979
are not the best ever but they catch

00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:39,869
most of my mistakes and obviously users

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,359
don't directly care about test fit

00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:45,239
because they don't want to contemplate

00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:50,849
the possibility of a backup program ever

00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:52,679
having a debauch however I care because

00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:54,389
this makes it much easier for me to

00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:58,379
trust things it also has the world's

00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:01,709
ugliest website those of you not reading

00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:04,610
your email can go to oblem dot organ and

00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:17,689
marvel at my web design and dye skills

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:19,979
Daniel okay I'll fix that oblem has some

00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:23,069
problems as well and I want to be

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:25,439
entirely honest about them one of them

00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:30,179
is that almost the entire development

00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,589
team is here it's my hobby project and

00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:34,319
there are a few people who occasionally

00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:40,159
send patches or help on the mailing list

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:44,299
but it's not a large community obviously

00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:47,729
this cannot grow by a number of people

00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:51,079
it's known to be very slow it is

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:54,749
possible the slowest backup program ever

00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:59,099
though I'm working on fixing now it's

00:07:54,749 --> 00:08:02,099
not ready to use yet and occasionally

00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,019
there have been fairly serious bugs up

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:09,839
to and including destroying people's

00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:10,379
backups my test fit is nice but it's not

00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:15,959
perfect

00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:18,659
please help as far as I know all the all

00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,149
the known bugs are fixed now sorry all

00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:25,409
the bugs that might corrupt the backup

00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:28,019
repository are fixed now and I fixed

00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:31,289
yesterday morning before I left for

00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:34,259
debconf a bug that would prevent parts

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:35,960
of my demo that is coming up I made

00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,880
release yesterday

00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:47,040
it also has the worst world birth

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:49,410
marketing team for any software ever the

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,580
world has large numbers of backup

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:55,890
programs it seems that every hacker and

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,390
every season mean at some point realizes

00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,270
that yeah they really should make a

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:03,120
backup unity so they write the wrapper

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,940
script around our thing and some of them

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,000
release this on free software and it is

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,240
good I do not want to compare to any

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,130
other backup program I don't have the

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,360
time to go and look at them properly and

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:20,160
any comparison I make would be unfair

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,800
however if someone else wants to do this

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,590
this would be a service to all free

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,330
software users or other office of the

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,930
users who have any data that I ever care

00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:34,170
about a proper comparison would be

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:37,470
helpful I don't care which one you use

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,560
as long as you make backups and never

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,570
lose data for other as long as you never

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,180
lose data if you never lose data and

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:50,880
don't make any backups good for you say

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:58,010
I'm gonna do a couple of live demos and

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:58,010
I need someone to hold my mic

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:14,560
no it's fine it's fine so I have two

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:17,530
machines here the left tab the current

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,240
tab is my laptop the right tab is my

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:26,140
server rather it used to be my server

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,330
there we go I'm not telling anyone where

00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:36,360
the server is trusting Jessica and break

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:36,360
it that would be telling

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:51,000
so the first demo will do what I call a

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:53,830
pull sorry a push back up from file and

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,340
this is an example configuration file

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,470
for

00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:03,790
oblem uses an inny format which is

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:06,970
common the root variable specifies where

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,790
the live data is the data you want to

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:14,290
backup where it is and I'm gonna back up

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:18,760
my backup program repository is where

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:22,360
backup should go and open and can run to

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,780
access the robot the the repository over

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,850
SFTP so we go to the server machine and

00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,560
put it in that directory if the

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,430
directory doesn't exist it gets created

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:40,060
I also want to encrypt my backups using

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:44,710
a gbgt and I'm used setting the source

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:47,980
for random bits to Debu random so that

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:52,530
the demo goes faster some people tell me

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,530
that this is the proper default anyway

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:08,780
so this is how you would use this you

00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:17,580
specify the configuration file and you

00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:21,870
second good enough and then you have the

00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:25,260
sub command called backup if you push if

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,380
you put the configuration file in a file

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:30,930
called hablando confit in you see in one

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,700
of the usual directories it will pick up

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:37,020
that automatically so you don't have to

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:41,280
repeat the config option and oblem takes

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:43,490
up also I should sing and dance for a

00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,490
while

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,550
what it's telling there is how long it

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,520
has taken how many files it has found

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,850
and how much data it has found and it

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,800
will tell you if my font was smaller

00:12:52,850 --> 00:13:06,150
what file is currently doing on working

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:09,870
on and some people think this could be

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:12,870
more more more useful feedback could be

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:15,390
provided and that is entirely true but I

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:20,990
have never found a solution that

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:20,990
satisfies everyone come on there we go

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:31,200
then gives you some statistics on how

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:34,380
long things stick then we're on the

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,940
second generation the vendor changes so

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,940
this should did go faster

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:53,440
and that's how you run a backup the fuse

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:58,120
plug-in is what I'm going to be demoing

00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:05,080
next where you can mount the backups you

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:07,300
have made that's what it looks like

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:11,110
however I will show you this in Nautilus

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:13,410
because that's more graphical unless

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:18,430
this is too small

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:21,460
can everyone see this so there is a

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:24,430
directory for every backup generation

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:28,210
the first backup is called generation 2

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:31,090
the second one is 11 these are not

00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:34,990
random but effectively weird numbers

00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:38,190
that Optum twos is for base don't worry

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:49,740
about the fact that they are very weird

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:49,740
we can go and open back up this is yes

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,950
so he said that the numbers for

00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,320
generations that Auckland chooses are

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:04,960
strongly monotonic and if I understand

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:07,810
my math correctly it is true so this is

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:17,380
a view into a backup stored on my server

00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:22,030
which is somewhere unspecified and you

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:26,020
can go and open false you can go and

00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:29,560
open files with various pregnant it

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:32,470
looks to these tools exactly like a file

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,240
system you can't make any change it is a

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:41,470
backup you can't delete files from your

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:44,260
backup and it is a little bit limited in

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,120
some corner cases meaning that sometimes

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,210
programs can get a little bit confused

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,830
but what you can do is say that ok I

00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:55,790
want to

00:15:50,830 --> 00:16:00,050
restore those stickers in the my home

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:02,620
directory in the demo directory and

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,620
there we go

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:28,670
and as usual with fuse that's high one

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:31,580
model I have a second config valve this

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:35,570
would do a pull back up but it basically

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:49,400
use accesses deserver over SFTP and

00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:57,830
stores the repository locally and it's

00:16:49,400 --> 00:17:00,530
equally boring to look at takes a while

00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:03,440
I thought it went faster than this when

00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:12,050
I prepped must be that network

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:14,120
connection to my server to oblem you

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:18,560
specify both the location of the live

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:21,200
data the route and the location of the

00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:25,730
backup repository using either a local

00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,100
file path or a URL SFTP URL and oblem

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,940
doesn't care where things are oh there

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:35,600
we go I could show you how to browse

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,550
this backup repository as well but it

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,570
looks exactly like the previous one site

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:44,620
doesn't matter and I'm about out of time

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,620
so thank you

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:13,000
thanks is there any questions hi lass

00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:15,220
I'm using on several machines and I

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,180
regularly have the problem that there

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:27,550
are old locks that I have to open by

00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:29,650
force so run optimum force lock we there

00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:33,100
already was a discussion on the mailing

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:35,140
list that there should be a time stamp

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:39,580
on the locks or somehow information that

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:43,450
autumn can now when it is safe to ignore

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:47,920
those locks what's the status of this or

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:50,620
in the roadmap it turns out that if I

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:54,130
put any information into the lock while

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:57,700
it gets encrypted at the moment meaning

00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:01,510
that if you have to lock a different

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:05,260
client so oblem repositories can contain

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,030
data from multiple backup clients it

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,740
gets encrypted with someone else's key

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,800
and you can decrypt that and then you

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:16,900
can't unlock it either which is slightly

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:19,570
unfortunate status is that once I'm done

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:23,440
with what I call format green albatross

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:26,470
I hope to start looking at this annoying

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,300
slightly smaller problems than every

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:33,340
backup taking until the heat death of

00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:35,050
the universe but certainly that kind of

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,250
thing needs to be fixed because it's a

00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,250
fairly big problem

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:48,290
hello Lars I maybe you said that but I

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,470
didn't understand it do you handle

00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:53,240
extended attributes in that backup yes I

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,740
handle extended attributes in the lab

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,740
data oh that's very good thank you

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:20,060
hi you said it's slow why I like to make

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:21,530
people cry I'm not so much interest in

00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,360
your personal motivation making slow but

00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,250
rather the technical reason how you made

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:31,880
it slow so how do you how did you make

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:33,360
it snappy it took years and years of

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,210
work

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:41,490
now the technical reason for why oblem

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:45,370
is live is a case of multiple reasons

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:47,320
one of them is that I'm using the copy

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:53,320
and write be treated water FS is also

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:55,330
using is this one and I have a my own

00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,610
pure Python implementation of those and

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:02,490
they're in many ways really nice but I

00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:09,850
couldn't make them quite fast enough

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:13,450
need a good butter has another reason is

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:15,480
that I have largely so far concentrated

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:19,559
on making it correct

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:23,590
apart from no English a bugs and so on

00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:25,629
but handling things like extended

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,769
attributes handing things like being

00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:31,330
able to remove backup generations

00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:33,549
handling things like actually being able

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:37,539
to simultaneously do encryption and

00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:40,629
deduplication and then I thought oh yeah

00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:42,129
but some are done with this hardware is

00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:50,379
going to be so forth it doesn't matter

00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:53,860
how slow I made it I was wrong but one

00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:55,899
of the examples for a technical actual

00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,230
examples here is that when oblem does

00:21:55,899 --> 00:22:03,580
deduplication it does this by taking the

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:06,519
live data and creating dividing it up in

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,889
chunks and currently every one of those

00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,840
chunks gets uploaded separately to the

00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:12,970
server

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,450
that's a round-trip that can be hundreds

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:18,249
of milliseconds long and the default

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,889
trunk size is one megabyte so most

00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:24,360
people have file smaller than one

00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:27,129
megabyte most of the time source files

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,490
now most people have so fast less than a

00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,490
megabyte

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:41,320
so does it also mean you can also back

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:44,320
up to some other high system using fuse

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:47,350
and because some pickup solutions to it

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,900
with the halflings which very card can

00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,410
catch you with a fuse file system like

00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:57,760
that the 50s it cooked already

00:22:52,410 --> 00:23:01,120
so I can just give a path to the 50s

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:05,260
equipped it and it will work I'm not

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:12,280
entirely sure I understood that but I do

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:14,950
handle hot links and Amna makes makes

00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,630
lot of takes a lot of effort to make

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,900
sure that there are no inherent

00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,309
restrictions like that because I don't

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,740
want that's all part of the being

00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:24,700
correct I don't want to have

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,809
restrictions like not handling hard

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:33,000
links or not handling files of 0 bytes

00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:37,450
or not Hamming files that end with JPEG

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,280
jpg or whatever there's no point in

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:44,230
having a backup program that can't

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,090
handle your data or oblem also has a

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,520
mode of deduplication that basically

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,380
this never be duplicated and another

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,900
mode called very fiber it always

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,750
verifies that there's no section

00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,520
collision in order to accommodate people

00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,500
who do research in the checksum

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,260
collisions it would be really

00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:06,130
unfortunate of spending five billion CPU

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:08,220
years or generating a show five five

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:12,150
minutes well checksum making a backup

00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:16,500
losing your hard drive having to restore

00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,500
and not have a collision anymore

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,559
is it also is it also possible Simba

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:36,909
okay is it also possible to make a pack

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:48,340
up use using disk attached to local

00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:50,710
machine yes okay thank you hi

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,470
you said it export supports extended

00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:59,279
attributes when you say extended jiménez

00:24:53,470 --> 00:25:07,990
in SELinux levels of SSD Linux um

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:09,789
permission things maybe I've never

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,600
actually used as in Linux but if it

00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:15,610
stores them to using the standard

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,850
extended attribute mechanism as it used

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,580
for

00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,320
for example ACLs open um should handle

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,620
them as long as Abram has permissions to

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:28,259
read and writers I think we are very

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,259
short of time so maybe one more question

00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:36,100
hi my question is with the more

00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:38,830
increasing use of file systems like

00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:43,770
betreff s & GFS that have advanced

00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:49,100
features does omnomnom able to

00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:49,100
leverage those features somehow no

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:56,130
autumn is written basically to assume as

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,520
little as it can get away with from the

00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,990
file system at the repository stored

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,670
meaning for example if I use the fat

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:08,100
file system yes you can store your
