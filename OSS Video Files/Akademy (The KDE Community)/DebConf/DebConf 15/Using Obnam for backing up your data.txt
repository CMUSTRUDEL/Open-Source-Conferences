Obnam is an easy, secure backup program. It de-duplicates data, and encrypts it locally before transferring the backup data to a remote server over sftp. It supports a FUSE filesystem for restoring data using normal file management tool 

This talk shows how Obnam is used in various cases, and covers both basic and advanced use.
