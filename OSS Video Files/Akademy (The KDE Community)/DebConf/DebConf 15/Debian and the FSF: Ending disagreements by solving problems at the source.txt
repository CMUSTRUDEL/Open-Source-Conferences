Debian and the Free Software Foundation, along with its GNU Project,
share many goals and ideals. They are two of the most mature and
dedicated organizations working in the free software movement.

Last year at DC14, FSF executive director (and Debian Developer) John
Sullivan presented a list of joint initiatives that the FSF and Debian
could work on together to advance the cause of free software, even
without Debian being officially recommended by the FSF. As a group, we
also talked about some of the reasons that Debian is not on the FSF's
list of endorsed GNU/Linux distributions.

I will give an update on the status of these joint initiatives,
especially about progress on the h-node.org database of hardware that
is compatible with Debian main and the FSF's endorsed distributions (a
cooperative initiative that was announced shortly after DC14), and
about the import of package info from Debian main into the FSF's Free
Software Directory.

I'll talk about the thorny problem of navigating between, on one side,
recommending nonfree software to users, and on the other side, giving
them a distribution that won't work on the laptop they currently use
-- and what we could do together in order to get out of this jam.

Finally, I'll present some new ideas for us working together and
continuing to strengthen our relationship, and hope that you do the
same.
