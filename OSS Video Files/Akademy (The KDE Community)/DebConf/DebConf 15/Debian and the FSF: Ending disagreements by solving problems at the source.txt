https://debconf15.debconf.org/

Debian and the Free Software Foundation, along with its GNU Project,
share many goals and ideals. They are two of the most mature and
dedicated organizations working in the free software movement.

Last year at DC14, FSF executive director (and Debian Developer) John
Sullivan presented a list of joint initiatives that the FSF and Debian
could work on together to advance the cause of free software, even
without Debian being officially recommended by the FSF. As a group, we
also talked about some of the reasons that Debian is not on the FSF's
list of endorsed GNU/Linux distributions.

I will give an update on the status of these joint initiatives,
especially about progress on the h-node.org database of hardware that
is compatible with Debian main and the FSF's endorsed distributions (a
cooperative initiative that was announced shortly after DC14), and
about the import of package info from Debian main into the FSF's Free
Software Directory.

I'll talk about the thorny problem of navigating between, on one side,
recommending nonfree software to users, and on the other side, giving
them a distribution that won't work on the laptop they currently use
-- and what we could do together in order to get out of this jam.

Finally, I'll present some new ideas for us working together and
continuing to strengthen our relationship, and hope that you do the
same.

okay okay everybody welcome to our next

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:10,440
talk about relations between debian if

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:13,280
in a free software foundation so please

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:21,020
give a warm applause to john sullivan

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:22,650
[Applause]

00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,660
thank you

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,010
so my name is john sullivan I'm the

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,490
executive director at the Free Software

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,250
Foundation I work at the Boston office

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,840
I've been there since 2003 not

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,649
coincidentally also the first year I

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,420
became a debian user I've been the

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,840
executive director just since 2011 and

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,520
in my free time outside of that I've

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,379
been a Debian developer since 2010 I

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,789
don't think contrary to what leanest

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,969
said last year that I'm either crazy or

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,610
on drugs but I will leave that up to you

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,820
to decide and I will plead jetlag most

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,620
likely so unfortunately as my FSF

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,059
responsibilities have increased my time

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,439
for other free software projects like

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,049
Debian that I've worked on in the past

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,400
is decreased so I have to confess that

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,159
my packages are in a pretty terrible

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,170
state right now especially the you know

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,369
crucial X word package which I know

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,590
you've all been missing how do you do

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,869
your Sunday crosswords without the X

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,670
word package I'm hoping to spend some

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,869
time this week to get those things back

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,900
in a better State and make some time to

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:30,060
contribute meaningfully I'm talking here

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,680
as an SF representative but as a Debian

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,420
developer I also really want to see a

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,890
closer relationship between the two

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,560
groups and between the two projects it's

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,430
something that's really important to me

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,820
personally but I think also really

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,729
important to both the FSF and Debian as

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,770
projects that are uniquely committed to

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,149
free software ideals I really appreciate

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,610
the chance to talk to you all about this

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,079
today this is a bigger group than I was

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,880
expecting I was surprised to be

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,799
scheduled on the weekend with the

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,630
emphasis on the open public day I'm

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,719
really honored by that and really

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,590
appreciate you all being here so related

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,540
to that can I just ask for a quick show

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,069
of hands how many people saw my session

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:12,000
last year in Portland okay so less than

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,410
half so I am going to cover some things

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,670
they'll be a bit repetitive

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,040
from that last year but I think it's

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:21,930
necessary in order to set the context

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,000
and make some of these points clear and

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,890
we have a well we have a bit less than

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,590
an hour here and my plan was to try to

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,630
leave at least 15 minutes at the end for

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,040
a discussion I'm here to answer any

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,840
questions or hear any feedback you have

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,370
for the FSF in general in addition to

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,350
the points that I cover and the

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,780
presentation but you can still interrupt

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,980
me if you like as well along the way if

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,690
you have questions that are especially

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,850
pertinent to something that I'm saying

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,100
so other than libra planet on which the

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,080
FSF hosts every year in March depth comp

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,570
has quickly become my favorite event of

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,850
the year because it is so committed to

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,910
both the community and the production of

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,980
free software and that's very different

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,540
from what seems to be the trend to other

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,760
events that I attend throughout the year

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,040
which I have a greater emphasis on

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,560
figuring out how to support proprietary

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,590
software using free software so it

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,150
really feels good to be here and I am in

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,070
all I would love for labor planet to be

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,660
able to travel around the world each

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,180
year instead of always be located in

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,010
Boston like Deb Kampf does but I have no

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,740
idea how you guys pull that off year

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,390
after year so well you know speaking of

00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,310
working together maybe we can co-locate

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,110
an event sometime that might be a fun

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
thing to try and also you know my secret

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,720
agenda to figure out exactly how you

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,520
managed to do this so well I hope that

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,590
some of you nevertheless will make it to

00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,020
Labor planet and Boston next year we've

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,850
had several speakers from the Debian

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,410
community there over years past and

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,930
it'll be awesome to have more of her

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,280
presence there also you know we have a

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,510
bit of a friendly competition and now we

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,920
have to step it up since you've

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,230
surpassed they were playing at in terms

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,520
of attendance we need to get to do a

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,920
better job of getting more people there

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,690
so congratulations on the record-setting

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,450
registrations this year it's awesome to

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,180
see this is actually only my third dev

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,770
comp but it's my second one in a row so

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,840
this is a nice opportunity to be able to

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,970
check in and present some updates about

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,190
some other project possibilities as

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,070
collaborations that I mentioned last

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,390
year during the talk but first thing I

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,700
want to say is happy birthday

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,320
I couldn't celebrate too much last night

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,330
because I had to be you know awakened

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,450
coherent to present it what is 5:00 a.m.

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:26,310
my time but I did enjoy being there and

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,840
the vegan cakes were delicious thank you

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,970
for having those

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,030
we should also say happy birthday to

00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,250
genome here turned 18 on the same day

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:52,630
yesterday so can we say happy birthday

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:54,640
you know the FSF is also well first I

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,740
want to say that Debian has been and

00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,970
continues to be an incredibly important

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,770
project for free software and nothing

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,640
that we talked about in terms of the

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,320
FSF's endorsement or the way that we see

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,740
particularity zuv Debian should take

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,900
away from that big picture you the FSF

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,370
has had many servers running Debian over

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,880
the years with only main installed of

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,580
course and several other distributions

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,020
that we actively endorsed and promote

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,780
actually are derived from Debian and

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,990
couldn't exist without them so I want to

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,970
thank you all for your hard work for the

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,120
quality of the work that you do you know

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,920
the technical quality and also for your

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,140
commitment to your free software ideals

00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,660
and the principles that have driven

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,370
Debian for those last 22 years I think

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,370
it's incredibly valuable and part of

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,880
part of why I'm here is to help see what

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,490
I can do to help and that work so yep

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,440
stuff is also celebrating a milestone

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,930
birthday this year

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,280
that's our 30th birthday and we are

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,070
having a celebration that I hope some of

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,150
you'll be able to make it to on October

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,090
3rd in Boston

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,710
we'll have both a mini user summit user

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,200
freedom summit during the day and then a

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,270
party in the evening and if you can't

00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,550
attend in person I hope that you will

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,169
check out there will be local events

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,940
around the world that people are already

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,169
stepping up to organize they'll be fun

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,480
opportunities for people to get together

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:23,770
and celebrate free software and what the

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:27,250
free software movement achieved so today

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:29,350
I want to talk about two main themes the

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,570
first of which is the question of why

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:34,530
the FSF the delicate question of why the

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,729
FSF doesn't fully endorse Debian and

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,710
what the possibilities are for changing

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,180
that situation and then the second thing

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,080
I'll talk about is what I think we can

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,030
work together

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,889
in the mean time even if the mean time

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:50,020
turns out to be a really long time I

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,789
chose the the bad you know punny title

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,750
of this session you solve problems at

00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:55,620
the stores get it

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,639
yeah it's FSF and getting a tradition

00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,110
because I happen to think that if we

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,180
were together working together

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,729
effectively on some of these specific

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,129
projects we might find ourselves solving

00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:08,259
the perceived disagreements again by

00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,939
side effects and getting ourselves

00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,370
closer to the world that we all want to

00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,750
have so if you look at our big picture

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,569
goals between the epitaphs and Debian

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,490
they're there suspiciously similar so

00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,830
the free software foundation goal is to

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,940
have all computer users to be able to do

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:28,030
everything they need to do on any

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:30,639
computer using all made free software my

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,889
reading of the debian goal is that we

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,729
want to have a universal operating

00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:39,129
system which will remain 100% free and

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:41,289
never have any non free requirements so

00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:43,150
I take universally to mean able

00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:46,120
Universal to mean able to run on any

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,990
computer big or small to be used by

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,090
technical and non-technical users alike

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:56,500
with no non free dependencies so to me

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:59,529
these visions look strikingly similar in

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,289
terms of distributions for the FSF we

00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:04,389
don't have a single lone official

00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,770
distribution but we have a lists that we

00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:08,770
think a list of distributions that we

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:12,159
think are actively implementing the goal

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:15,550
that we want to see in the world these

00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:18,190
distributions have two key commitments

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,580
the first is to remove all non-free

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,860
software and to not ship any non free

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,680
software and also to avoid steering

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:30,039
users towards non-free software outside

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,010
of the distribution so last year at this

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,800
time the list of distributions that meet

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,199
these criteria looked like this included

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,019
a flag from left to right there blagged

00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:42,849
record eine bala q nuisance music's

00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:45,190
parabola triskele which is what the FSF

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,980
uses primarily on our workstations and

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:52,000
servers and which is based on Debian by

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,949
way of a bun - Andrew - so X which was

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,520
the first distribution that was endorsed

00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,860
under these crates

00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:01,270
you there's been a few updates to the

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:04,060
list since the since last year protein

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,950
OS which targets embedded devices but is

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,560
also intended for use on laptop boot

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,110
systems was added this is a distribution

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,030
that can be used in the future we hope

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,370
to replace things like the Intel

00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,890
management engine firmware that runs on

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,570
a separate CPU at boot time in the

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,670
machine you can actually we hope in the

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,570
future be able to flash that proprietary

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:28,540
operating system with protein OS we also

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:32,290
added Libre CMC which is currently

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,880
targets wireless routers but as the goal

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,040
of working with other kinds of embedded

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,630
systems as well and this was a nice

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,830
announcement because a couple of months

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,630
after we announced that distribution

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,240
endorsement we were able to announce

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,240
certification under our respects to

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,040
freedom hardware program of a wireless

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,440
router a home wireless router running

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,060
this distribution so I think this is

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,000
awesome you can now from think penguin

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,160
purchase a wireless router running 100%

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,150
free software I know a lot of us have

00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,500
been waiting a long time for that

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,210
there's always been something you know

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,370
either it's the proprietary blob for the

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,020
wireless or the bootloader for the

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,370
router you know there's always been some

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,110
non free component but all those things

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,520
have been replaced with free software so

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,990
these two distributions together created

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,020
a new section on our list actually which

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,130
is focused on small system distributions

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,560
ones that are targeted towards systems

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:24,190
with little resources like routers and

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,840
small CPUs inside machine we also added

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,610
the geek system distribution the last

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,350
one there some of you might be

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,340
interested in that it's a declarative as

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,870
a declarative operating system

00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,190
configuration and has other kind of

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,780
interesting features like the ability to

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,210
do transactional upgrades and rollbacks

00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,880
on a system and have per user

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:42,670
installations of packages without giving

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,530
out route access for studio so it's a

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,640
pretty cool thing especially for all of

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:49,210
you that are interested in functional

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,540
programming so why isn't debian on the

00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:54,040
list so debian is actually in a special

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,110
category that's not reflected on the

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,970
lists and we've been looking for ways to

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,820
do this but haven't found a satisfactory

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,340
one yet so it's the only distribution

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,290
that meets the first criterion to not

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,150
include any non free software and to

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,110
remove expeditiously any non free

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:12,490
software that's the scum

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,649
in the distribution that's not already

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,720
on the list and the FSF fully

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,300
acknowledges this and it appreciates the

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,130
work that's been done too in the

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,410
official Debian distribution to bring an

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,690
all free distribution to users so that's

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:28,149
something that we want to highlight when

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,339
squeezed made the decision to remove the

00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:31,870
non free software from the kernel that

00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,279
final remaining bit you know we put out

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,860
an announcement celebrating that

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,570
achievement and highlighting Debian for

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,610
doing that and there is no other

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,050
commonly used major distribution that's

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,480
in that category every other

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,000
distribution that's considered you know

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,320
comment among users contains non free

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,940
software in its official distribution so

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,290
that is something that sets Debian apart

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,480
and I know that this message is not

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,250
always clear in particular I know that

00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,600
some well-meaning efforts up supporters

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,570
have a habit of saying that the episode

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,700
thinks Debian is non free and that's not

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,230
true and you can now cite this

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,870
presentation as evidence that that is

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,510
not true we say very clearly that Debian

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,480
main is all free software and upholds

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,070
commitments just as good as what the FSF

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,029
expects of ourselves and it's official

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:21,040
distribution so in Debian's case the

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,360
lack of endorsement is from us is

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,480
primarily because of the relationship

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,550
between official Debian and unofficial

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,610
Debian the non free and contribute

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:33,550
auditories and that relationship to us

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,949
seemed too close for our comfort there

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,320
are spots in the Debian infrastructure

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:41,260
where those sections even though

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,110
technically separate are integrated very

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:47,980
closely with main so for example and

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:50,440
package searching in recommends and

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,779
suggests fields within packages that are

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,370
displayed to users so even though I

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:56,050
think in Debian we have an idea that

00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,180
these are separate as not as not always

00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:02,019
as clear to your users on the outside

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,070
and they will they can end up being you

00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:07,089
know sometimes inadvertently or

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,470
sometimes just lead to install non free

00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:09,839
components on top of the official

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,399
distribution

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:17,440
there are also some cases of individual

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:20,050
software packages in main after

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,550
installation the leading users and

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,310
recommending users to and

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,990
all non free software an example of that

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:30,040
from last year and the presentation was

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:32,560
iceweasel where the add-ons menu in the

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,500
browser had a very prominent

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,990
recommendation to install Evernote which

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,269
was a proprietary add-on and did not say

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,149
that it was proprietary in that view

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:45,670
inside iceweasel so there are cases of

00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:47,680
this where the Debian packaging isn't

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,940
recommending any non free software but

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,620
immediately upon running the software

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,589
and clicking on a option within the

00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,899
software the user gets shown Bret non

00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:57,850
free recommendations so other

00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:00,339
distributions have been struggling with

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,260
this problem as well and we're having to

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,910
develop separate extension repositories

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,010
in some cases for different programs in

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,329
order to you know extend that commitment

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,399
to free software a little bit further

00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:13,959
I'll talk about some of that toward the

00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:15,519
end I hope so I think these issues are

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,170
important to discuss within Debian you

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,019
know regardless of what the FSF thinks I

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,570
think that you know the social contract

00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,920
language that Debian remains run under

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,839
percent free and has no non free

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,700
requirements as you know tension with

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,440
the idea that you want to support people

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,160
who create or use non free works in

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,120
Debian that you'll support the use of

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,610
non free works and provide

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,589
infrastructure for non free packages

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,060
you know those there's a lot of play

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:41,680
there that that's tough to figure out

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,940
and I think for Debian itself those are

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,440
important topics to be discussing

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,420
I'm happy to see there's another

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,649
presentation at least one more here that

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:52,180
plans on tackling those issues so I know

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:54,310
that some people see the FSF standards

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,950
in these areas as either a kind of

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:59,500
censorship or as anti user in some way

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,560
by trying to kind of hide software from

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,910
users or pretend like it doesn't exists

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,010
but I think the Debian itself has many

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,980
policies in place which are designed to

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:11,170
steer users one way or another when it

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,640
comes to the software that they use you

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,339
know it seems to be a primary reason why

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,170
the contributes in the archive even if

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:19,720
packages are free if their only purpose

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,000
is to point to your non free packages or

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,820
install them they go in a separate place

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,440
outside of main or you know there's

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,779
limits on ways packages in main can

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,160
refer to packages and non free

00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:32,620
especially when it comes to dependencies

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,640
and I know that since the last dev

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,000
console there was the Technical

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,120
Committee decision that

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,360
listing a non-free alternate dependency

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,190
and a package in Maine as acceptable and

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,480
it's a little bit uncomfortable with

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:50,660
that decision but I also saw clearly

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,100
that it is couched in terms of caution

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,810
you know the actual presentation of the

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,490
decision said that package maintainer

00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:00,380
should be very careful about using this

00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:02,750
because of the way it can lead to use of

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,430
non-free and also that the Maine

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,710
dependency is still a requirement you

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,230
can't have just a dependency on non-free

00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:12,860
so I don't think even though the

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:14,540
decision is not consistent with what the

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,400
FSF is looking for in the distributions

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,990
we endorse I think it also didn't you

00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,990
know change much about the things that

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,640
we already have to talk about I think

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,740
that the act of making a distribution is

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,470
by definition active steering users one

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,850
way or another and that's why in some

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,680
senses users choose a particular

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,170
distribution because they like the way

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,150
that it steers them and the kinds of

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,140
software that it presents to them so I

00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,210
don't think the debian is actually

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,130
uncomfortable with this idea I think

00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,960
it's a question of degree and and of

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,540
framing and and framing isn't just about

00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,920
semantics it's about the questions that

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,030
are posed and the way that they're

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,740
answered you know what we're talking

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,980
about in terms of censorship or are we

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,200
talking about in terms of supporting

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,660
users who want to just one time choose

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,070
all free software and never be presented

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,190
with a choice to install something non

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,300
free again yeah so the framing if that

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,980
question matters and I think it's

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,750
important that we talk about these

00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,240
things in specifics you know another

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,699
example was security Debian will remove

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,189
packages that have security bugs that

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:15,020
don't get fixed after a long time even

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,850
though users and they complain loudly

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,459
about that because they want to continue

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,319
using the software so Debian makes a

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,850
judgment about what kinds of software it

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,329
wants its distribution to be associated

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:32,120
with and then sets up you know practices

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:32,750
and policies to facilitate that so in

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,940
the end I don't think broad

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,040
generalizations about steering

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,880
recommending suggesting are really that

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,160
helpful it's a gray area it's not a

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,740
bright line and I think that we need to

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,799
focus on the specifics of where we

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,090
choose to draw that line

00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:53,299
but the quickest way out of all this is

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:57,860
to just make the vast majority of

00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:59,899
hardware or all Hardware if possible be

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,320
supported by free software and to have

00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:05,659
free applications free versions of all

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,870
applications that users might be said to

00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:10,129
require under the social contract right

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,809
if we have those things then we don't

00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:17,509
have to worry about these questions so

00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:20,120
back in at the end of July the FSF Board

00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:24,279
had our had its first ever strategic

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,779
planning meeting and the most important

00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,730
five-year goals that were discussed at

00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:30,830
that meeting I think are actually goals

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,080
that are the vast majority of Debian

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:38,360
developers probably also agree with so I

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,620
wanted to share some of those so we want

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,299
there to be readily available and

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,580
contemporary hardware products that work

00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:46,759
with and contain all free software in

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:49,700
particular laptops and tablets but other

00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:52,250
devices as well it's awesome that a

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,299
labor boot x200 was or it wasn't given

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,889
away this morning or it's going to be

00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,649
given away

00:18:53,889 --> 00:19:00,740
did somebody in here win it yeah

00:18:56,649 --> 00:19:02,509
graduation spend I was really happy that

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,129
we were able to certify that laptop

00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,289
under our respects your freedom hardware

00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:09,610
program earlier this year you know we

00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:12,950
are despite no cooperation from

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:16,340
manufacturers still catching up in terms

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,690
of the modernist of the laptops that

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,000
we've been able to endorse you know I

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,379
was actually using an X 200 anyway at

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,269
the time that the endorsement came out

00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:25,009
so you know I know it's not as

00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:26,330
contemporary as a lot of people want and

00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:28,220
that's why we still have this as a goal

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,200
but I see us making some good progress

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,179
there and I'm really happy whoever

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,360
donated that and made that a part of the

00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:37,070
conference this morning we also want to

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,139
end regulatory mandates for proprietary

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,929
software these exist in all kinds of

00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:44,299
places you know from the FCC to the IRS

00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:46,519
you know to accessing government

00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:48,019
documents of various kinds you know all

00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,659
of these things create cultures around

00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:52,669
the world that are hostile to free

00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:55,129
software and therefore hostile to Debian

00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:59,149
you know you can't be an official Debian

00:19:55,129 --> 00:20:01,220
system user and interact satisfactory

00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:05,540
satisfactorily with those systems

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:08,930
we want schools adopting free software

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,580
and compatible hardware for students and

00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,530
I think initiatives to promote free

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,540
software in those context also lead to

00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,310
great opportunities for Debian you know

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,340
I assume that part of Debian's universal

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,930
goal is related to education and schools

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,000
and certainly any you know long term

00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:25,100
play at getting more people to use an

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,510
operating system involves getting people

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,790
using it at a younger age and getting

00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,530
comfortable with it we want the general

00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:34,070
public to see free software as their

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:36,890
issue debian also wants the general

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:39,170
public to be Debian users to be free

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,220
software users you know I think many of

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,900
us in the project don't like the

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,080
reputation of Debian as an operating

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,060
system that's specially suited for for

00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,300
system ins or servers you know we think

00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:52,280
that Debian is and can be distribution

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,760
that works for non-technical users as

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,310
well and I think that getting the

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,060
general public to understand that and

00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,590
give it a try

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,140
is something as the goal that we very

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,370
much share so obviously you know I said

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,860
five-year goals we're a little bit

00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,480
ambitious here and these goals need to

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,970
be you know fleshed out a lot they need

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,100
to be quantified and made more specific

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,540
but I wanted to present them you know

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,520
they're only a few weeks old here but I

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,670
wanted to present them as a way to show

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,960
that I think on big-picture issues the

00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,600
FSF and Debian have a lot of agreement

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,400
and that professed disagreements have a

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,440
lot more to do with things that the

00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,950
level of tactics and what's right in the

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,280
current moment but in the end we agree

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:36,320
on things like this so I think we should

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,740
collaborate more on projects that get us

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,070
closer to these things last year I

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,750
presented this lists and the first thing

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:48,020
on the list was the free software

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,720
directory so the FSF has been building

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,100
this directory of free software

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,450
individual free software programs

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:58,940
initially it was supported by UNESCO and

00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:00,860
for many years it's been developed as a

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,510
manually curated collection and a free

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,970
software that has no non free

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,520
dependencies and follows a basic level

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,200
of good licensing practices that sound

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,810
like any other projects maybe other were

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,820
familiar with it's a lot like Debian you

00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,840
know the active packaging programs as a

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,299
curate of curate

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,070
Debian packages and developers become a

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:22,169
little bit familiar with licensing they

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,600
have to be in order to make packages

00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:26,820
that he get accepted and of course we

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,169
all keep an eye out for things that

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:33,149
don't follow good practices in those

00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:34,499
areas so before a few years ago the

00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:36,509
directory was maintained by just a few

00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:38,009
people we we had a full-time staff

00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:40,200
position to do the majority of the work

00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:42,179
along with a few great volunteers but

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,399
this approach never really scaled so a

00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:48,240
few years ago we decided to convert it

00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:50,009
to semantic media wiki enabling more

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,980
people to add entries and keep those

00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:54,269
entries up to date so truthfully it

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,429
still wasn't fully a Wicca fide we're

00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:57,840
using the approved Rebs extension which

00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:59,789
means that you have to be granted some

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,080
extra access in order to be able in

00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:02,639
order for your changes to be immediately

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,100
live otherwise they have to be approved

00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:06,990
by somebody but we very readily give out

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,279
editor access once a person is

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,110
demonstrated that they understand the

00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,299
basics of the criteria for inclusion in

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,610
the directory and that they understand

00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,809
the process you know a lot of that fault

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,779
lies with us for not having a better

00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:20,399
documentation which we're working on we

00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:23,129
have weekly IRC meetings every Friday

00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,480
and pound FSF on freenode where people

00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:26,340
have been getting together to add and

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,539
update entries we no longer have the

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,399
full-time staff position so these

00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,769
meetings are run by Joshua Gay who's the

00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:33,779
head of our licensing and compliance lab

00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:35,970
turns out to be a very appropriate match

00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,470
because the hardest the biggest

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,970
challenge in deciding whether a program

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,549
should be added to the directory or not

00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:44,249
is figuring out whether it's actually

00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:46,590
free software and whether it has any non

00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:49,499
free dependencies I think as a lot of us

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:52,980
know from Debian work upstream doesn't

00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:54,990
always make that very easy so it's an

00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,340
area that requires that kind of license

00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,869
and expertise which by the way is part

00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,269
of the point of the directory because

00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,799
telling people to use free software when

00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:03,269
it is actually not that easy to figure

00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,549
out whether a given program that you

00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:08,100
find on the Internet is free software is

00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:10,769
asking a lot of simply we want to make

00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,539
that easier so this process new

00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:13,769
processes worked out very well and we've

00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,080
seen a significant increase in

00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:17,309
participation but at the same time in

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,009
parallel we've been working on an

00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:25,019
automated systems import all of Debian

00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:26,279
main into the directory and this was

00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,490
something that we had in mind from the

00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:32,029
beginning of the decision to

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:33,409
convert it to semantic MediaWiki and so

00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:36,710
from the beginning we were looking at

00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:38,779
things like depth tags as the guiding

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,480
light for how our semantic property

00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:42,650
system should work we wanted to first of

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,789
all we thought it was a good system and

00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,279
second of all we wanted to preserve

00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:52,580
hopefully forward compatibility for

00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:54,110
importing entries from debian so the

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,520
idea here is to create entries in the

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,470
directory for each appropriate package

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,440
in main and then also to be able to

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:02,029
automatically update those packages with

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,260
a system to reconcile those updates with

00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:05,299
any manual updates that have been made

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,070
and this whole process is made possible

00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:08,510
by the awesome system the Debian already

00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,789
has for structuring packaging

00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:13,100
information and making that you know

00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:15,020
predictable and regular within packages

00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,360
one thing I have as a hope out of this

00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,770
project is that we'll be able to help

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,710
with some of the initiatives that seek

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,480
to improve that system even further and

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,220
that we'll be able to help and I think

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,320
we already have a little bit with

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,659
helping to make sure that packages

00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,159
consistently apply those standards you

00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:32,570
know because we find since we're doing

00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,179
this import and an automated fashion we

00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:37,190
finds hiccups and and inconsistencies

00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:39,140
between packages and I don't know if

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,549
we've been perfect about this but we

00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,659
definitely have a goal to file

00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:47,929
you know the appropriate bugs in those

00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:49,549
situations and patches to help fix it so

00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,350
as part of an initial test since my talk

00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:56,299
last year we've already imported about

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:58,429
1,500 packages so as a test run which

00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:01,010
brings our total up to about 8700

00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:03,049
packages and the next import which I

00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,960
which may be happening as we speak right

00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:08,210
now it was supposed to happen this

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,529
morning so there may be entries being

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,320
added from Debian a into the directory

00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:14,419
right now this import will bring the

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,429
total number up to 15,000 so it'll pull

00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:18,559
in another you know 7,000 or so from

00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:20,179
Debian main so I'm not the best person

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,510
to talk about the technical details of

00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:25,549
this like why aren't you know the all

00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:28,460
43,000 packages already imported or what

00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:30,200
the challenges are but if you want to

00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,429
drop by one of these IRC meetings or or

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,510
find me I can connect to you with the

00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:35,419
right people who can't answer those

00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:37,490
questions and of course you can read the

00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:39,289
source of the importer script which is

00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,510
in that git repository hosted at

00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:42,240
Savannah there and I'm sure they will be

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,929
happy to accept

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,670
patches or feedback from people who you

00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:49,920
know the the actual script work was

00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,260
started by deaf Debian developer that a

00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,510
lot of you know it has been continued by

00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,220
Rubin who was the founder in the

00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,179
developer of triskele also very familiar

00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,950
with Debian and it went to packaging so

00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:03,690
they have had some success but they can

00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:08,010
always benefit from more eyes and advice

00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:09,030
from experienced folks so why is this

00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,350
working important you know can't you

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,970
just Google all the programs you need

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,500
you know a lot of people have been kind

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,510
of I've heard criticism of those

00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,270
projects along those lines before but

00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,370
you know actually increasingly I have

00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:23,160
been feeling that the work of building

00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:25,550
this manually curated curated catalog is

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:29,490
incredibly important for free software

00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:31,650
adoption and and the long term there for

00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,380
Debian adoption so a big problem that we

00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:38,370
face with convincing users to switch to

00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:41,100
getting Linux is to convince them to try

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,690
a free application to begin with they're

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:47,460
not using the gnu/linux they're using

00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:49,440
Windows or OSX so it's asking a lot of

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,940
somebody to say may I just change your

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,429
operating system you know trust me

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,500
everything you need is there right it

00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:57,780
really can help to have individual

00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,630
programs that run on multiple platforms

00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,920
that people can acclimate to and then

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,150
after they're using a couple of those or

00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,280
a few of those they may feel a lot more

00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,679
ready to spend the time to try out a

00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,630
distribution and then they like what

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,340
they see we hope and they finish the

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:16,140
process but we face an obstacle with

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,780
that which is there's proprietary

00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,210
software companies out there telling

00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,559
people not to download anything from the

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,710
internet that doesn't come from one of

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,290
their official locations and frankly

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:30,750
given the state of you know computer

00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:33,300
security and malware that's not terrible

00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,910
advice so it's kind of hard to be the

00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:38,010
ones fighting for no go ahead install

00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,840
any program that offers itself to you

00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,750
for free on the internet that's not a

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,710
good approach on top of that you know

00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:48,600
users are expecting software to be

00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:52,450
presented in the form of you know app

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,640
stores and curated locations now

00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,680
to the extent that we have those four

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,660
free software in general outside of

00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,550
distributions they're mainly in

00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:03,220
directories that are curated for the

00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:06,300
purposes of advertising revenue and not

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:08,140
really for the purpose of helping users

00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,550
and then there's the fact that even for

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,870
experienced users it can be hard to

00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:13,450
figure out what the license of a program

00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,310
is like I mentioned so we have a couple

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,200
of goals here one is that we want to use

00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:20,500
the directory as a canonical source of

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,870
programs that are free and then provide

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,210
a mark that people upstream can display

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,800
to show that they're included and the

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,380
free software directory and that can be

00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,210
propagated as a sign of trust or an

00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,890
application not necessarily like that

00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,660
it's an awesome application or that it's

00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,730
perfectly secure but at least that it is

00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,650
a free application source code is

00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:44,740
available follow some basic best

00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:47,710
practices and then I also hope that it

00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:50,500
can turn into this sort of app store

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:54,790
free software marketplace for users and

00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:56,440
I think that Debian and other

00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,690
distributions have been we're doing this

00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,640
App Store thing long before any of these

00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:04,450
came along and been doing an awesome job

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,720
at it but that only kicks in once a user

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:10,630
makes the leap to install it so I think

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,640
that it is in Debian's interests to help

00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,590
with efforts to encourage users to make

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,840
those first efforts trying out

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,660
applications that are also present in

00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,010
Debian on the prototype proprietary

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,410
platforms that they're currently using

00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:25,840
and I think that can be a way to get

00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:28,510
people comfortable with the idea of full

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,460
keenya Linux distribution people have

00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,840
talked about building other App Store

00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,560
like features onto the directory things

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,420
like reviews user ratings demos you know

00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,440
ways to donate directly to projects I

00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,840
think there's a lot of potential here

00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,890
with something like this and I look

00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,020
forward to seeing some of that

00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,720
materialize I think in Debian debian

00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,880
terms it can be a great source for you

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,770
know ITP and an RFP bugs looking for

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,120
packages that are upstream free software

00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:55,210
programs that aren't yet packaged in

00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,370
Debian I mean that's the goal and we're

00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,380
going to be importing hopefully packages

00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,060
from other distributions as well so it

00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,650
can be a place to look for seeing what

00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,370
other distributions have package that

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:09,860
maybe hasn't made it into Debian yeah

00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:12,290
so getting involved in the project those

00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,490
are the basic ways if there's enough

00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,780
interest in the Debian community you

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,090
know maybe this can become a joint

00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,120
project and some more official higher

00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:22,040
profile capacity but you know either way

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,590
if individuals just want to help out

00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,360
that's awesome and I want to definitely

00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:29,360
say thank you for doing the work to make

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,760
this possible to begin with this is you

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,280
know a free software directory that only

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,290
was 5000 packages before we started this

00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,570
is not nearly as good that's one that

00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:43,460
will build on the work that you all did

00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:46,250
and list 40,000 packages so the next

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:51,200
thing that I had talked about last time

00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:55,010
was the situation with some upstream

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,480
policy issues like Mozilla this

00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,970
situation has become more complicated

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,040
since last year the Windows version of

00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,170
Firefox is now is now calling out and

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,630
installing a proprietary Adobe DRM

00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,400
module the first time Firefox is run

00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,870
they're not yet doing this for the

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,650
getting a Linux version but it seems to

00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:14,240
be in the cards and I already mentioned

00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:18,200
the issue with the proprietary add-ons

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,790
so other programs do do this add-on

00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,040
approach better you know vibra office

00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,990
for example has a list of extensions

00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,300
it's official list of extensions is all

00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,070
free software so it's not as though this

00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,380
is some pipe dream the majority of

00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,120
Firefox extensions are free software you

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,680
know it's just I think something that we

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,840
share that we want to make sure users

00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,540
see those things clearly marked and that

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,280
Debian should be primarily leading users

00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,750
towards free software solutions for

00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,900
problems rather than the proprietary

00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:46,460
ones so the main action that's happened

00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,570
on this over the last year was that as

00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,250
part of the free software directory

00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,430
actually if you look at the AI suite

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,750
sorry i scat page and the directory but

00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,610
this applies for iceweasel as well

00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,130
you'll see a list of extensions that

00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,690
have been vetted and added so there's a

00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,160
system within the directory to indicate

00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,170
that one program is relate as an

00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,330
extension for another program and so

00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,700
we're using that to build a list of all

00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:11,300
of the free extensions I think this may

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,660
become more urgent because of Mozilla's

00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,570
decision to only allow signed extensions

00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:19,130
in the official Mozilla repository

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,929
signed extensions are great

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:25,240
they're not allowing users to modify the

00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:28,309
keys in the browser the accepted keys so

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,380
Firefox will only allow extensions that

00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:32,539
are signed by the official key there is

00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,770
no interface for users to change while

00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:35,299
there is interface for users to change

00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,250
that it's called rebuild the pack

00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:39,350
rebuild the software from source with

00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,110
the new keys in it so I think there will

00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:45,440
be demands from other users to install

00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:47,720
signed extensions from people they trust

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,400
you know so various developers that

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,630
they're familiar with even those

00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,620
extensions may not be signed by the

00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:57,130
official Mozilla key the next thing that

00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,720
it talked about was the database of

00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:03,409
hardware that's compatible with all

00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,490
fries with free software this I was

00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,559
happy we actually put out an

00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:10,040
announcement shortly after deb comp last

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,300
year together to say that we joined to

00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,030
help free software users find the

00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,040
hardware they need so the FSF had been

00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,629
helping to build this database differ

00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,550
from other databases of compatible

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:21,109
hardware normally those are presented

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,169
just as a question of does it work with

00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:26,330
the kernel Linux or not irregardless of

00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:28,159
regardless of whether it's a proprietary

00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:31,669
firmware or proprietary drivers required

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,040
so H node takes a stricter approach and

00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:37,129
only lists hardware that works with a

00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,440
fully free system like Debian main so

00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:40,940
previously we had said that users needed

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,590
to be running and this information all

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,810
as users submitted we'd previously said

00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:46,639
that users need to be running one of our

00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,800
endorsed distributions in order to

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,990
contribute information in order to avoid

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,250
inaccuracies and slip-ups from people

00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:55,159
thinking that something was supported by

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,869
a non free driver or by a free driver

00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,960
not realizing they had a non free driver

00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:01,670
installed but we are we made the change

00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,150
to add Debian main specifically to the

00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:07,550
front page of HT org has also a valid

00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:10,359
and recommended source of information

00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:13,220
for this so I'd really love you know to

00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,720
work more with Debian folks on this

00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,630
there needs to be more information in

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,460
the database the site the code the

00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,560
powers the site itself needs a lot of

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,300
help you know design could be better

00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,070
there are translations there could be

00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,330
more there's lots of opportunities to

00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,310
help out with different skills that's

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,869
there and I think that I know there's

00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,510
been a lot of demand within the Debian

00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:34,869
community to how can we get the official

00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,830
distribution to work on more systems

00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:38,540
since we no longer have the proprietary

00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:41,510
firmware there you know how do we make

00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,130
it easier for users so I think the first

00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,440
step is to make it easier for users to

00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,420
figure out what to buy in order to use

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,520
Debian main and I think that's something

00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:52,550
and the Debian project we could do more

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,740
on and and the FSF we're also going to

00:35:52,550 --> 00:36:04,190
be working hard at doing more in that

00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:07,100
area so if you'd like to be employed

00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:10,400
working on any of these projects we are

00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,650
actually hiring for a deputy director

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,720
position to work closely with me and the

00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:18,770
FSF staff and board on these issues and

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,660
it does come with a star if you are ok

00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,250
with living in Boston which I'm told at

00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,070
least is the most European of American

00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:30,020
cities it it's you know our beers not

00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:32,300
bad either and short of that I will be

00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,980
here until Sunday and we'll be happy to

00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,450
meet with people that are interested in

00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,010
talking and working on any of these

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,680
projects that I mentioned or talking

00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:41,690
about other possibilities other ideas

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,240
you know I kind of lied about leaving a

00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:48,680
lot of time for questions so please feel

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:53,990
free to grab me and find me and there is

00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:56,210
still the FSF collab discuss oh I don't

00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:58,010
have it on there on Ellie off there is

00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,720
an FSF collab discuss mailing lists

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,820
that's not been very active but it is a

00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,130
great space in the past but it's a great

00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,109
space that we can use now to continue

00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,940
conversations about this and I'm

00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:10,490
subscribed and will read anything that

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,060
people post there so the bottom line for

00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,859
me

00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:15,980
for all this is that while the FSF is

00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:19,670
not promoting in the short term debian

00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:22,369
as a distribution we are working hard on

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:25,430
projects that will help the official

00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:27,550
Debian distribution flourish and I think

00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:30,500
when you look at our utopian goals

00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:32,240
they're very compatible and I think

00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,369
that's a very good reason we should be

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,350
finding more ways to work together to

00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:38,119
make those goals a reality I think that

00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:40,670
if we do that we'll see the

00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:43,520
disagreements and perspective and even

00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,900
probably see them start to make way for

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,550
more and more areas

00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:59,660
of agreement because we really do have a

00:37:46,550 --> 00:38:01,910
lot of them thank you so if there are

00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:05,320
any questions please line up to light

00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,320
left and right side

00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:24,080
I'm and we heard a lot about what how

00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:28,300
Debian should change to be included in a

00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:31,460
FSF free software directory if actually

00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:35,770
what about the changes debian would like

00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:40,340
to see in the new project over the FSF

00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:45,800
like the GFDL being considered non free

00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:46,790
by debian in some the wines yeah so

00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,370
first of all I do you think this is a

00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:51,620
dialogue that needs to change is on both

00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,930
sides and I'm sorry I didn't say that

00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,300
explicitly and particularly I think that

00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,620
the that if you look at the

00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:01,820
distributions that we have endorsed

00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:04,790
they've been smaller projects and the

00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:06,380
criteria sort of worked differently when

00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:09,380
you're talking about smaller projects

00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:11,810
versus projects the size of Debian with

00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,900
the number of users the Debian has so I

00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,280
see I can see our criteria and where we

00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,560
draw the line in that gray area being

00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,510
influenced by the conversation with

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,490
Debian as well you know if I had you

00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:25,580
know very specific changes that I

00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:27,020
thought had to be made I would provide

00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,190
those but do you think that it's

00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,130
actually a conversation that needs to

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,510
happen and with regard to the GFDL I

00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:35,420
think you know my mind that's an example

00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:39,980
of a disagreement that will be well not

00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:44,150
in the end be a blocker to endorsement

00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:46,280
of Debian by the FSF or vice versa I

00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:49,970
think that if we understand each other's

00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,140
perspective on that and it's not

00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,560
something that needs to be an obstacle

00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,970
to lots of other forms of cooperation

00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,410
and I think that we get on the same page

00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:00,160
about more things and then we come back

00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:03,250
to that and see what we can agree on

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,250
thank you

00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,079
other questions

00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:31,089
time to wake up well this is not really

00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,380
related to Debian so I was waiting to

00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:36,130
see if other people had more other

00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:39,070
questions but regarding the like the

00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:41,470
director that you have for software for

00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,589
distributions the endorsement for

00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:47,680
distributions they have anything for

00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:50,410
services like that users even if they

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,820
have a free system but they agree in

00:40:50,410 --> 00:41:01,119
terms of services in the cloud and so

00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:08,160
how how the users can be like can

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:10,720
believe on SSF or any other director or

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,720
organization that will support us in

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,420
making a decision yeah I think that's a

00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:20,020
very important issue and it had had it

00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:21,880
on the you know our approach primarily

00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,130
is to try to encourage development of

00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,640
decentralized replacements decentralized

00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:30,609
free software replacements for the

00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,680
services that people have been using so

00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:35,200
I think that that's something that we

00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,609
can work together on also you know a big

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,800
problem with why people don't already

00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:40,720
use the ones that are out there like

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,810
media goblin organ your social or pump

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,000
i/o is that they are not easy enough to

00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:47,560
set up and obviously as a distribution

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,720
you know Debian has a big role to play

00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,930
and helping that helping make that

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:56,200
possible so that's one answer is to try

00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:58,260
to make the world better for users that

00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,220
don't want to use the centralized

00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,940
services and then within the directory

00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:07,270
we have a way of creating different

00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:09,310
kinds of collections so we can tie you

00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,599
know those programs together as these

00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,390
are programs that are related to the

00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:18,190
problem of network services or software

00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:19,780
as a service and then we soon will be

00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,579
publishing some recommendations and

00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:24,970
criteria for specifically hosting

00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:26,890
services what kinds of criteria they

00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:28,690
should meet in order to be you know used

00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,920
by any projects or recommended by Genaro

00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:32,260
the FSF

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,790
kind of one category of service that was

00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,049
really in the news after victorious went

00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,220
away and people were sort of like well

00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:37,809
you know where do we go now

00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,299
if we don't want to go to a more

00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:41,829
centralized place like github so if

00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:44,770
those are currently what we have in mind

00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:46,359
my definite think there's a need for use

00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,829
talking about user freedom outside of

00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:49,299
the programs which run on their

00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:52,329
individual computer and you know how

00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:59,369
they experience that on a network thank

00:42:52,329 --> 00:43:02,619
you you previously talked a bit about

00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:05,410
Hardware supporting free software and

00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:07,869
free software supporting hardware just I

00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:10,299
wanted to know what does the FSS thinks

00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:14,049
about the participation of steam in

00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:16,869
Debian and how even though steam uses

00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:21,880
proprietary hard prepared proprietary

00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:26,290
software how can this help bringing free

00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,960
software to hardware yeah I mean

00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:31,809
obviously you know we did we don't like

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,040
steam OS as a distribution because it is

00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:36,790
you know does contain proprietary

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:41,020
software it's possible that you know in

00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:44,200
the ends it may result in games are a

00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,819
problem for free software users you know

00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,559
it's I can understand the perspective

00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:49,150
that it is an improvement over having a

00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:51,549
dual boot you know Windows environment

00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,829
in order to play games and I know that

00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:55,030
that steam has been and Valvo been very

00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:56,260
cooperative you know technically it's

00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,510
the game with the Debian community I

00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:03,130
think that we should continue to you

00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:06,609
know ask them to release the steam code

00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:08,920
itself as free software and also to make

00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:10,540
sure there's room within any you know

00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,520
marketplace of software that people are

00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:15,130
using for free applications which I'm

00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:18,910
not sure that that's possible and steam

00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:20,020
right now so you know I think we

00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,359
definitely need more initiatives around

00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,770
free games you know we do some small

00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:26,200
things with the FSF we run a Labor

00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:27,670
Planet gaming server that you can get

00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,230
involved in administering or playing

00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,730
games on and it has you know mostly some

00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,520
of the classic multiplayer free software

00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:37,530
games but it's a topic we're interested

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,940
in it's just you know we need to to find

00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:42,099
ways to compete with a lot of social

00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,180
aspects like the fact that video game

00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:45,450
companies get

00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,680
subsidies to make proprietary software

00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:49,960
and the industry is extremely

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,839
competitive that way so there's a lot of

00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,210
problems to tackle there steam may end

00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:56,170
up in the end being helpful but I think

00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:58,690
you know in the short term it's not

00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:07,510
something that we can recommend users to

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:09,160
install yeah I just wanted to kind of

00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:12,130
expand a bit on what was said a moment

00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:15,119
ago about well essentially cloudy start

00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:19,480
software as-a-service things like that

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:22,660
this is something that Debian is coming

00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:27,250
to recognize I think as one of the

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:28,809
biggest threats to user freedom in

00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:31,380
general most of the people here in the

00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,980
room will probably have a non-free phone

00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,099
running all sorts of interesting

00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:39,190
applications and it's quite difficult at

00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:43,960
the moment to do better with that I know

00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:45,550
the FSF are slightly you know going in

00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,460
that direction there's there's some

00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:50,440
projects within the FSF but I think I'm

00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:52,869
slightly concerned are your list of

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,859
strategic goals and doesn't seem to have

00:45:52,869 --> 00:46:00,250
that as you know a thing that really

00:45:56,859 --> 00:46:03,420
needs to be addressed and you want to be

00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:06,400
looking about yeah much more closely

00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:09,190
yeah I think that it's I think that in

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,079
the discussion it is implied by a couple

00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:12,700
of the goals one of which like I said

00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:14,710
that it was a very tight connection

00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,650
between the mobile environment and the

00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:19,180
service environment you know it's these

00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,730
services are getting a lot of traction

00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,020
because on smaller devices you want to

00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,069
be able to well you have multiple

00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,799
devices so you want to be able to access

00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:28,420
your files for multiple different places

00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:31,119
you want to be able to participate in

00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,410
services like you know over airline

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,760
applications you know all these things

00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:38,470
that are geared toward life in a mobile

00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,970
sense so I think addressing the mobile

00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:41,859
side of things having all those

00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:45,010
applications be free software is a

00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:47,260
precondition to effectively addressing

00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:50,109
the service question and then I think

00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:52,410
that's the issue of having the general

00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:54,579
public see free software as their issue

00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:55,960
should probably I should have actually

00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,410
written that as the general public to

00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,020
see

00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:02,020
user freedom as their issue and I think

00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:06,820
that that is getting people to care

00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:08,680
about what happens with their when they

00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,420
give up control over the software that

00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,090
they would in the past have run in their

00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,860
system to a remote server that whether

00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,570
that's software on the server is free or

00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,160
not doesn't matter because the user

00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:20,050
using it doesn't have access to the code

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,690
or to modify the code or do anything

00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:24,760
with it so I feel like the goal of

00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:27,520
getting people to see their freedom as

00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,640
an issue strongly implies figuring out

00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:34,450
how to replace that you know remote

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:38,250
service model but probably should be set

00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,250
explicitly there yeah thank you

00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:59,640
I call from earlier beats from the DPR

00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:03,920
letters that there was some ongoing

00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:09,900
discussion between you and the DPR about

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:12,869
solving the endorsement problem can you

00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:15,390
give us data Soph or maybe can you give

00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:17,400
your view of the effectiveness of these

00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:21,540
discussions and whether they are stored

00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:24,180
or they are still ongoing so yes so that

00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:27,270
started when Zach was DPL and has

00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:29,940
continued since then and I think that

00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:31,800
they've been I mean that they're why I'm

00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,780
here talking about this you know I think

00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,080
that those conversations made me feel

00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:40,050
very welcome to come and have a

00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,520
conversation and to talk with people you

00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,859
know in addition to the DPL on the

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,330
Debian community about these things so I

00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:47,190
think they've been very you know from my

00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:50,010
side they've been very effective at

00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:52,740
getting things started back up again

00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:55,080
they have been slow but I will accept

00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:58,589
you know basically all of the blame for

00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:02,700
that I have not in any case been waiting

00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:04,920
for a reply from the deme inside so they

00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,089
have been slow but that's my fault and

00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,550
anybody who's been on that mailing list

00:49:06,089 --> 00:49:09,510
for quite a while knows that there was

00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,820
kind of a burst of activity at the

00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:13,589
beginning and then I didn't follow up on

00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:15,480
what I was supposed to do and it kind of

00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:17,339
trailed off so what I've been trying to

00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,339
do by coming last year and this year is

00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:22,410
to commit myself again to help in those

00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,849
conversations before word but I really

00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:26,180
appreciate the support that I've gotten

00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:32,180
from the Debian side and all the dpl's

00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:32,180
thank you thank you very much John

00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,200
