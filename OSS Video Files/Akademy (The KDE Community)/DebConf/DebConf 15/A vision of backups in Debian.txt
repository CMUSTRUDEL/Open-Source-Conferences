I would like a default Debian desktop or server install to provide a good backup solution by default. This would mean that all the software is installed, and that it requires minimal configuration to start making backups. Further, backups should be as automatica as possible (no or minimal user interaction required), restores are simple, and that the backup system requires no or minimal administration once configured.

This talk outlines my thoughts about this.
