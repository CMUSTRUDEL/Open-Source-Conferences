MySQL 5.7 contains more new functionality and improvements than any previous release. Some of these changes were made specifically to make packaging of MySQL and software that uses MySQL easier, often based on input from package maintainers in Debian and other distros.

Join us for a tour of packaging improvements and challenges, and how we work with these topics upstream.
