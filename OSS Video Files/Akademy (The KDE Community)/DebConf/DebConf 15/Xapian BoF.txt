Xapian is used to provide fast search in several parts of the Debian infrastructure (lists.d.o, packages.d.o, search.d.o, wiki.d.o, debtags.d.n) and is also used by dozens of packages in the archive, from aptitude to zeitgeist-core.  It's installed on 95% of machines reporting to popcon.

This BoF is an opportunity for the maintainers and developers of these packages and services to get together and discuss all things Xapian.
