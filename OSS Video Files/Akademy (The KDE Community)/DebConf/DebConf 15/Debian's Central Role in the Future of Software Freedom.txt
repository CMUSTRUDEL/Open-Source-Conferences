Debian is among the oldest GNU/Linux distributions still active 
today.  A community-led project with democratically elected
leadership, Debian remains a shining example of a project that
serves developers and users rather than for profit interests and
wealthy trade associations that so commonly control and
manipulate Open Source projects today.  Debian culture embodies
the ethos of software freedom and the tradition of enthusiasts
and hobbyists (rather than businesses) directing the future of
Free Software projects.

As an independent observer and Debian user, in this keynote, I 
will examine the reasons why these principles have served Debian
well, considered early decisions that Debian made that have
assured a commitment to principle, explore how Debian can
continue to help everyone, introduce future collaborations that 
might succeed in helping Debian in its goals, and discuss the
unique role Debian can play in advancing software freedom.
