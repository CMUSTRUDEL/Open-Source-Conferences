https://debconf15.debconf.org/

Technically started in 2005, Munich's LiMux project was officially and successfully finished in 2013; albeit with a long delay, compared to our initial project plan, as much more work croped up.

Nevertheless the work on our Linux client(s) continues. New releases get rolled out, bugs get fixed and new features are implemented to improve the client, adapt it to the changing needs of the municipal IT, and support our users.

This talk will put the spotlight on the current situation and does a quick glance on the history, the technical tools used to manage our 33 000 users and 18 000 clients and a little future outlook.

okay so next is by an americorps Gursky

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,019
from the city of munich and it's about

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:18,779
the city of Munich's the Mocs system so

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:21,060
please welcome Denmark so hi everybody

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,850
probably you have heard that the city of

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,849
Minnie has moved a lot of its desktop

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,359
PCs to Linux that started quite some

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,579
time ago if there was quiet it was

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,760
really cried for the last few years

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,290
at the beginning we made a lot of

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,739
presentations whereas many conferences

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:45,719
like this talk more or less so this is

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:49,530
the update after quite a few years so

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,710
let's see some city facts just to get

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,010
you an idea what's happening in Munich

00:00:51,710 --> 00:01:00,239
we have 1.5 million threaded instance I

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,579
think last month there we chopped 1.5

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,320
it's still the third largest city in

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:12,330
Germany 12 large cities in Europe we

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,479
have 33,000 employees with PCs and about

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,729
1000 people working in the IT

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,220
departments it's not just obviously Linn

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,270
or us yeah we have programming people we

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,850
have admins it's a large community

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:30,450
municipality so we have a lot of IT

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,450
people working there currently we have

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,229
deployed 24,000

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,229
PC workstations

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,390
that's it especially if you compared to

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,960
be originally 18,000 we started 10 years

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,560
ago that's a lot of more machines coming

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,590
up still that's one of the problems also

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,110
we have 50 operation locations in the

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,219
city so it's not just a single building

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,320
where you can deploy everything

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,280
obviously for services from people

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,369
budgets all around the city it's managed

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,799
by 22 independent

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:12,050
IT departments that means a lot of

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,680
coordination that also means normally

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,480
when were sent

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,360
idea apartments we are living that

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,680
aren't working that I tear em when we

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,420
release something new 22 IT departments

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,329
decide on their own when they want to

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,269
roll out our stuff which we developed

00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:34,439
the picture just Charles few of them the

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:36,720
largest one it's still very

00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,549
heterogeneous infrastructure but it's

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,799
getting better over time especially

00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:45,120
because we moved into a single IT

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:48,780
building for a central IT that really

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,069
hopefully will help us get more stuff

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,010
out faster so just for you to remember

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:58,230
if you have heard of a project we the

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,840
project has actually started in 2001

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,200
that was at this time an internal

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,750
project the IT has realized okay we are

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,849
NT for Microsoft saying we don't support

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:14,909
NT for okay anymore and ya IT ask the IT

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:18,030
council what which should we do if we

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,489
cannot use NT for anymore and we achieve

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,970
the central city council and decided

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:27,049
okay what options do we say have and

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,970
then was there was about two years

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:32,310
catching up with ideas different

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,750
companies came different ideas came up

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,949
and at the end it was decided okay

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,940
independence is good better than

00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:44,810
depending on some larger company and so

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,489
let's try lineups

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,129
project origin project goal was to

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:53,790
migrate eighty percent of all the

00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:55,620
desktop PCs and just remember that the

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,930
desktop we are not talking any servers

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,699
we are we were not consolidating

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,919
anything the heterogeneous

00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:04,530
infrastructure was still there and the

00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,510
city decided to roll out Linux client so

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,879
that's what we were facing at that time

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,359
that means we had come to their servers

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,430
some Solaris servers from whatever

00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:16,799
hardware was built in the last twenty

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,239
years was still standing somewhere and

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,940
we had to support that from a Linux

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,130
client side than 2006 the first beta was

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,370
released after

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:32,540
that long tender and why we are already

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:35,330
developing Linux we realized that we can

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,060
also start migrating people to

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:41,030
OpenOffice on Windows before actually

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,740
they get a Linux client so it's it's

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,780
much easier for them if they already

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,420
know the programs are working than most

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,700
people don't really realize that they

00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,370
have Linux and they do not really care

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,820
that's was something important we found

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,470
out during this time so even bets of

00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,970
people we are complaining about Lionel's

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,860
we were looking at their pcs and there

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,650
was actually Windows XP running on it so

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,620
really people don't care they need their

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,500
office and it's a Firefox and

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,420
Thunderbird for web email and do their

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,010
stuff and they want to do that stuff

00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,730
they don't normal people don't care

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:20,660
really so in 2011 half of expected

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:23,450
species when we created 2013 bulimics

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:27,890
project or it really was really finished

00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:31,300
so internally it's just supporting Linux

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:34,430
in the city language project you should

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,500
officially are not really allowed to

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:41,300
talk about lions anymore because Linux

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:43,790
is finished but we are Linux UNIX is

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,580
still growing and City wise use so we

00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,580
are currently having 18 town pcs and if

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,190
you look at 2005 there was a maximum of

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,770
all pcs were 15 towns so we are more

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:58,070
than the maximum that was they are cute

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:01,700
yes before that's the current state so

00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:05,480
what are we currently deploying current

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:08,120
releases our 5.0 release we are using

00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,820
dock which you might know already we

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,400
started at using a little at we are

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,440
really little with referee Pro it works

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,980
if you are just single or two developers

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:23,690
but if you have a few people uploading

00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:26,630
stuff it gets confusing and there's not

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,480
very good looking and database so we

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:32,930
implemented our own version of tak with

00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,570
a few additional features which will be

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,820
an upstream dock hopefully at the end of

00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,630
a year because we get a student and he

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,210
is going to pour

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,010
all our stuff too Davian sufficiently

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,890
version so hopefully that we work out

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,920
yeah we have rolling out Firefox and

00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,170
Thunderbird ears are we are earning out

00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,080
updates prophecies our version but we

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:57,500
have to stay with user otherwise a lot

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,670
of applications may break which people

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,830
are using and with our most patched

00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:06,320
program is definitely LibreOffice we are

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:09,530
on four point one that's already two

00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,740
years old and we have something like 300

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,780
Petrus on that so that's really a you

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,150
more or less a huge patch play but

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,820
everything is in master so everything we

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,070
have developed this already in 5.0 we

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:26,750
just did backwards after ever developing

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,370
the stuff we make you an a after we talk

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,600
please

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:35,630
so yeah we have at the end we have 296

00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,300
change source packages with changes from

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:42,140
us with own patches backwards and

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:48,620
everything and total install base of

00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:51,560
about 4000 binary packages so now you

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,830
have 18,000 PCEs what do you do to

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,470
manage that that's something really at

00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:00,170
the beginning it was really hard there's

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:03,740
those LDAP management tool called cosa

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:07,550
it has a lot of features but it was not

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:09,020
originally designed to manage clients

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:13,280
that was something we were mainly

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:15,590
developing in 2005 and 2006 it's open

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,080
source and you can get the current

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:22,940
version at github in this repository I

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,600
can if you are really interested I can

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:30,980
show you that after the talk but not

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,539
here we install the stuff using FAI so

00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,190
it's completely automated you can

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,729
trigger the installation from goes are

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,140
you can put a date when the stuff should

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:42,979
when the computer should be waking up

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:45,590
and basically all our installed data is

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,720
an LDAP there's just one single reason

00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:51,770
for that because add up is the only

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,480
citywide usable database everything else

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:58,060
is so in

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,500
even that that you can't use that client

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,750
and user infrastructure management

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,459
infrastructure is also developed by us

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,860
we could generate application free

00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:12,399
configurations unlock and catering menu

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,889
host settings FAI integration we mount

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,139
Network shirts with user credentials we

00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:21,040
manage for printers sudo as fire so

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:23,529
admin stuff we have a roaming profile so

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,000
you can lock on an everyday pcs in the

00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:31,269
system but it's a it's a static setting

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,120
so you don't have a home directory on a

00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:37,000
on a share but it's already also it's

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,040
synced we have exact frequent figuration

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,029
and we manage with B storage device so

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,990
users cannot bring their stuff in and

00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:46,329
copy whatever they want

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,440
it's peyten to base to our current

00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:53,290
release and in case of stuff locally so

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,769
even if network is down people can still

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:59,620
work lock-in and yeah it's not yet free

00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:02,529
so I hopefully a lot of people will

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,389
write emails so to get back interests

00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:05,860
and then the city will release that

00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:07,269
stuff we still we did the stuff with

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:13,329
wall mocks but that's really the only

00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:15,730
project we released we have just an idea

00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:18,490
what we are reading we have four main

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:22,060
targets bowser's client is a normal

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,459
centre a normal PC for the user it's

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,500
fully managed it gets all the software

00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:28,690
installed it's completely managed by

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,029
Google then we have notebook

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,399
installation that's just basically the

00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:36,430
normal client plus a few staff which

00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,959
I've just used by notebooks they use

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,260
notebooks can just be used in the

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:44,019
internet or offline otherwise they are

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,579
not usable then we have some are what we

00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,800
call outbreak lines are just reclined

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:50,529
for presentations they are not allowed

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,290
to use in the city but you can copy

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:55,740
stuff their life for presentations here

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,360
and then we have a self-replicating

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,490
install server so we have an

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,180
infrastructure distributed to the 22

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,720
departments and we managed as well too

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,520
many too

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,040
distributive allowed for installations

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,120
because as you may know of I uses NFS

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,970
routes and we use NFS for since the

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:22,510
beginning it's only also now included an

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:26,480
FYI and so we need local installations

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:29,630
almost local so just because we're we in

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,690
the in the Kapadia I think we will last

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,950
photo of the client was from 2006 or

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,600
something like that and every time with

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:39,230
people looked as that so you can see

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,590
it's 2016 9 3 it's just the normal KDE

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:45,560
nothing special I just put the menu

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:48,320
there as you see anything there is no

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:56,870
magic involved that's how people are

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:59,360
using that stuff so and just to give an

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:03,320
idea how long we were working on that

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:11,000
release we are still on Ubuntu obviously

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:14,030
but we started on 1204 in 2012 we had

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,140
the first point release because they

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:21,560
were so many box

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:23,960
ok so took just one one month well and I

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,790
was about three months to get to the

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,240
software distribution initial server to

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,310
update then we started our normal

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,380
development circles then we realized ok

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:37,430
we have to put a lot of more time to get

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:41,270
LibreOffice into a usable way for users

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:44,690
then development finish testing finish

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:48,560
and the final release was yeah almost

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:52,010
2015 so it's really really long

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,640
development cycles and we want to cut

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:58,280
that down but we don't currently see

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:03,530
much opinions because all the time when

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:05,390
people are editors clients come up we

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,810
have more support we have more idea what

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:11,060
to implement and so that's currently or

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:16,580
a development cycle I hope we will get

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:19,460
faster with the next release so what's

00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:23,300
our really major problem because Lina

00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:25,400
normally works works quite good but as

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,530
you have seen our development cycle is

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:32,960
large or a release cycle is also

00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:35,000
launched so for 8 to 10 pcs we stock new

00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,550
hardware for about half a year that's

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,370
still a lot because for 80 tendencies

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:44,390
you can think how much Hardware breaks

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:46,730
per day almost and after half a year the

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,850
hardware stack which was delivered with

00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:52,640
boot to release or any other Linux

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:55,490
release is normally too old for a new

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,860
hardware what does that mean it means

00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,470
you have a backwater kernel you have a

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:05,240
backwater DRM you have a backroad mesa

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:08,660
xor xor drivers at least you get that

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:11,650
for one half of the year for two years

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:15,200
from a boon to this place so that was

00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:17,630
one major decision why we originally

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,380
started with Debian and then switch to

00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:24,080
Ubuntu because we couldn't come up get

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,800
up with the hardware and we see recycles

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,270
we're just too short actually for us we

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,330
would like to even have longer really

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:34,970
cycles as possible but choose years

00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,550
seems to be ok but with a level our own

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,430
development took last year for the last

00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:47,180
release two years - so it's kind of

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:50,120
critical the second thing is even if you

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,370
use Hardware enable mistakes when Ubuntu

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,500
you have to use one which is supplied

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,470
for distribution or one with two years

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,900
later and every time you have a new

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,820
version of your hardware support you

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,270
have to check it on all the hardware

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,940
outside that's really a lot of work and

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,580
a lot of work actually has it's not done

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,350
in with central ID but we in the

00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,050
distributed ite because they are

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,610
independent and normally is something

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,550
that happens quite often that they have

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,350
stuff which doesn't show up with us and

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,510
we just learned that after we roll out

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:28,190
actually has it and it doesn't work so

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:32,270
we hope to cut that a little bit down

00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,630
with hardware have a heart when a

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:37,240
woman's

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,240
thanks but just a new idea which came up

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:44,330
so over for one last slide just what

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,680
will be happening in the next year

00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:51,020
that's they're currently IT projects in

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,610
the city of minutes add up and probably

00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:59,090
we've heard of migration of mail and

00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:02,570
calendar client that was also publicly

00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:05,420
available but not so common now will be

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:09,320
the first one which have a large contact

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:12,500
windows rollout we hope we can depth

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,730
just upgrade for 4.0 from 12 to 4 4 to

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:20,120
14 to 4 and then really have a new one

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,640
new release based on kd5 system we use

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,460
64-bit but that will really get a lot of

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,710
work we get a new gaza version there's

00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,110
also the link and we go at new

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,780
infrastructure which will do all the

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:37,760
stuff for us so yeah

00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:40,670
further information email and there are

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,620
a few english pages but I think emails

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,990
to do that so if you really want to know

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,850
something you or have some ideas just

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:51,380
contact us there sometimes people

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:53,990
visiting from other countries so we are

00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,460
open to that so if you have an idea want

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,980
to put wrote something else want to get

00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,980
some more impressions just write an

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,440
email say ok we will come and know if

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,050
not in the next week but in the next

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,020
month and we can organize some views or

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,609
sets and yeah that's it so thank you for

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:17,260
your attention

00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:19,550
[Applause]

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,350
Thank You America

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:27,890
is there any questions yeah hello I said

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:30,050
you had quite a lot of patches for

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,480
libreoffice did you work with upstream

00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:35,180
trying to match them or submit to the

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:41,420
libreoffice bug tracker and is it that

00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:47,060
in your future plans also some how can

00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:49,100
we help you out we are actually and

00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,740
involved in the I'm a Libra office

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,860
developer I'm responder with KDE 4

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,500
back-end all over bucks and patches we

00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,260
have our in current Libra office yeah

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,170
everything is fixed so we develop those

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,320
300 Petra's most of them and quadrature

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:08,600
stuff for our release because yeah we

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,370
could not switch we just decided at some

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,440
point we would stay with 4.1 and get

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,050
that ready otherwise to get a lot of

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,210
more racks again so everything is there

00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,970
as we are developing with the community

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:27,770
we have support that's fine other

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:29,810
questions how do you handle

00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,710
synchronization of data for your laptop

00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,500
clients

00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,810
how would you either think Trinette

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,280
think for a knife at what given for

00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,260
example use our home directories and the

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,940
configurations that they've got if they

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:44,710
are on a laptop and not necessarily on

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:47,030
the network then how do you deal with

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,560
synchronization of I guess they have a

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,560
central storage somewhere and they have

00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,770
they have normally you have normal

00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,750
Network shares and then we developed

00:18:53,770 --> 00:19:02,120
known synchronization process which

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:06,410
means unlock in your shares mounted then

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:08,750
from loop back partition because it's

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,340
it's a it's a Windows share you have a

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,860
loop back positions there and then you

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,680
have an everything running to get all

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:20,090
the stuff to your computer or Windows or

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,270
it's independent if you have a notebook

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,540
or local PC so you can get practically

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,870
go everywhere in the city sit down

00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,210
wait some

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,350
like five minutes and then all the other

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:34,970
stuff is there

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,470
oh you haven't mentioned any kind of

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,330
group we're actually about saw the

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,550
Oracle calendar I mean is that the only

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,910
thing that you have built-in in terms of

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:48,230
the stack so the question was if you

00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:50,180
have something else currently or yeah

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,960
that's the current project which I just

00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:56,600
mentioned it's like Micmac that also was

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,340
a tender like three years ago or

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,309
something like that we are moving to

00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:06,830
collab completely and this will be

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:09,500
finished 2016 somewhere at the beginning

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:12,100
okay I think we have time for one more

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,100
question

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:20,360
hello for the authentication and stuff

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:31,760
are using this or you managing to do it

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:33,920
with what no everything it's an added up

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,140
even without everything really

00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,010
it's a paste because that's really the

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:42,830
only central database we have so it's
