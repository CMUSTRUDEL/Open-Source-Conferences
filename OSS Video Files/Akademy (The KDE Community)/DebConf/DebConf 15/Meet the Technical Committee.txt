okay hello I'm video the purpose of the

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,950
session that we're having right now is

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,170
for there to be an opportunity for

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,049
Debian developers who are present here

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,119
at Def Con to get a chance to meet the

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,730
members of the Technical Committee who

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,660
are present interest to have some

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,670
conversation about any topics related to

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,800
interactions with the Technical

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,990
Committee that you think might be more

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,120
productive to do in person at Deb conf

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,190
then through all of the other modes of

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,469
communication that are at various times

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,350
available to us this is something we've

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,079
been doing now at Def Con every year for

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,700
a lot of years I know it goes back at

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,890
least as far as Edinboro because I

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,379
remember that session distinctly for

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,750
several reasons thought that though that

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,460
might be the first time we did it so

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,210
that certainly means you know eight ish

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,010
years and some years have been much more

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,070
interesting than others I think it has

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,930
something to do with what the current

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,420
topics of interest are in front of the

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,920
committee I was intrigued as I was in

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,810
the last few minutes before we got

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,850
started because I hadn't noticed that

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,010
this was happening today until someone

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,600
asked me 20 or so minutes ago if I was

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,310
planning to come and so I thought that

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,790
feels slightly less prepared than

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:28,590
sometimes but that's okay

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,750
I am currently the longest standing

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,090
member of the technical committee which

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,700
means thanks to the general resolution

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,939
that we all collectively passed last

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,979
year December 31st this year will be my

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,780
last day as a participant on the

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,170
technical committee and Steve I believe

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,450
you are the second most length of

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:54,840
service person at this point I think

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:56,579
that's correct from the terms of the

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,469
channel resolution he is actually we're

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,170
both the same type of mount of the

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,840
committee but for the resolution he is a

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,469
bit Lomas and I buy whatever nonce

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,509
non-time but so I so there are more

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,340
years of committee so the good news is

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,230
you get the benefit

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,239
those of us are actually present at

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,160
DEFCON 4 this year represent long

00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,110
lengths of service in the technical

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,819
committee and can therefore you know

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,170
speak reasonably authoritative ly about

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,770
things that have happened for quite a

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,099
while

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,750
the bad news is that your credit cards

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,269
will only go so far with us because

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,470
after the end of this year Steve and I

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:33,480
will no longer be members of the

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,500
technical committee by the way that was

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:43,230
a joke that's still work you just don't

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,880
get much for it right so this is the

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,010
list of people who are currently members

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,230
of the Technical Committee those whose

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:56,640
names are italicized I believe are not

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:58,769
present this year and didier is will be

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,970
present that is not in the room yet okay

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,790
fine

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,840
Keith Packard sends his regrets

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:08,760
unfortunately his employer suggested

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,549
that he give a keynote at Linux con in

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:17,310
North America this week instead of being

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:19,530
here sorry Keith and yeah

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,600
Don Armstrong is now the tech committee

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,170
chairman and unfortunately also could

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,329
not be here in fact somebody pointed out

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,819
to me I think it's was about nine years

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,970
ish that I served as chair of the

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:36,209
technical committee and I decided early

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,430
this year that in light of the fact that

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:41,069
the end of December would be the end of

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,340
my tenure on the tech committee because

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:46,049
of the term limiting resolution that in

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,060
order to make sure we had a nice smooth

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,410
transition letting someone else have a

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,480
chance to take over as chairman before I

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:58,590
was off the committee entirely I was a

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,000
good thing to do and Don has suggested

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,829
that you know that's probably a good

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,690
pattern for the future at the beginning

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,940
of the year that would be the last year

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,709
of someone's term it might be a good

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,870
time for there to be a transition of the

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,670
committee chairmanship and we'll just

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,970
see how this all works going forward not

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:17,250
a big deal so what is the technical

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:21,269
committee about the technical committee

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:24,150
is one of the entities within the Debian

00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,810
project whose existence is defined

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,360
within

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,110
our Constitution specifically section

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,880
six the members of the committee are

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,250
appointed by the Debian project leader

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,470
and the existing committee members the

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,169
way this has worked in practice for the

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,110
last few years is that the committee has

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:45,480
come up with a list of proposed new

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,690
members whenever there was a vacancy or

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,550
need to add people and has proposed that

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,030
list of candidates to the project leader

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,980
who in effect has well so far the

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,830
project leaders always agreed with the

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,860
Technical Committee and that's how we've

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,940
gotten new members there has been for

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,370
those of you who've been paying

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,080
attention there has been more change in

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,190
the membership of the committee in the

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:14,970
last year than at any time in at least a

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,950
decade and not surprisingly this is

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,169
because of the consequences of the

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:22,050
stress level that was imposed on the

00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:26,660
committee by you know the events of the

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,660
preceding year systemd

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:34,050
I'm you know at some point I think all

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,350
of us who participate in the Technical

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,330
Committee understand that these are

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:43,140
things that we agree to do not so much

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,840
because they're exciting or fun but

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,240
because somebody has to be willing to be

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,610
the place where decisions happen and

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,260
somebody has to be willing to take on

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,750
the things that other people in the

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,789
project can't somehow successfully

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,610
resolve on their own and that is in

00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,720
effect what the Constitution defines I'm

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,430
not going to go through all of this

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,610
we've talked about it a bunch before if

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,740
anyone has questions about sort of the

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,419
constitutional bounding of the roles of

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,160
the committee feel free to ask and we

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:15,539
can go into that when we start the

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:19,610
discussion part the committee has sense

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:23,669
the deb conf that was held in Banja Luka

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:27,720
attempted to have roughly monthly

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:30,270
regular meetings on IRC to discuss open

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,810
issues and frankly to sort of go to each

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,120
other into action it's just a reality

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,160
that without deadlines nothing ever gets

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,990
done and so the notion

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,180
that people have to do list items they

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,370
can report on in a monthly IRC meeting

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,950
has in some ways helped us to make

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:51,240
progress on items which would otherwise

00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:53,820
perhaps not get as much attention the

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,070
difficulty of course is that when I went

00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,640
to pull up the list of open issues

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,710
before the committee at this time it was

00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,400
really simple I copied last year's list

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,380
and added one more at the bottom and so

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,930
on some level while there have been

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,700
things that have been discussed and some

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,030
items that have been closed in the last

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,260
year I can't say that I feel terribly

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:26,240
great about what's been accomplished

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:26,240
yeah the bug is still open in the BTS

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,930
yeah it seems a buck right so ok

00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,400
decisions been made the process hasn't

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,840
been run to completion the point that

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm trying to make is that there are

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,240
some things that have been open issues

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,590
for some time in all honestly the first

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,060
item here you know the proposed

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,010
constitutional fix for the tech

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,440
committee supermajority we collectively

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,980
agreed that the right thing to do was to

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,350
not act on that in the heat of passion

00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:00,330
after the Anette system discussion that

00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,790
what we should do instead since the

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,000
combination of the intensity of that

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,580
discussion leading to some changes in

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,520
tech committee membership and the fact

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,380
that the term limit resolution was at

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,600
that time already being discussed and

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,790
was headed for general resolution we

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,370
decided the right answer was to let some

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,950
of these things be dealt with after the

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,750
dust settled I don't know whether the

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,900
that particular item is one that we'll

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,480
try to come to any closure on the first

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,950
one is one of those which I'm going to

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,310
take it in the second half of this year

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:37,289
which is now started but yeah it's not

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,510
good to make such discussions in the

00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,760
heat basically we have an we have an

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,070
offer on Allinol constitution for the

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,780
supermajority decision because the

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,960
Constitution says if you want to have

00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,130
something by majority of n21 you did

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,680
have n through one plus one

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,240
which is not bad one developer says

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,160
large because we are so many people

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,080
English but it's more boring likes

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,180
taking committee it means that you if

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,760
you say with a suitable metrology and

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,770
six people vote then it needs that you

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,670
have five people for co2 one might Rolla

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:12,060
T which is yeah so it's really just off

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:16,030
by vanilla which we could fix

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:18,430
yeah and in the same context there have

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,500
been discussions about other things that

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,420
we might want to address regarding the

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,970
composition of the Technical Committee

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,760
in particular the point has been made

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,010
that there are some simple cases of

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,760
voting we're having an odd number of

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:36,640
members might lead to less likelihood of

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,950
an even tie than having an even number

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,500
of members but since we all understand

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,090
that conduce at voting behavior means

00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,990
that if there are more than two choices

00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:49,030
on a ballot the It Gets combinatoric

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,670
very quickly I don't know that that's

00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:54,160
something that anyone feels a particular

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,350
urgency about dealing we did thank you

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,510
speaking we have had many votes as

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,030
recently I can't just have one vote

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,550
there we have a very little bit about

00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:09,030
everything is there's actually two votes

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:12,490
but one issue so it's bad anyways okay

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:17,020
okay can you tell we all feel like that

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,820
but but in fact for most issues when we

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,100
have a solution miss at least we contact

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,960
one or two basis oilfield and then it's

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,090
very soon really obvious what the

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,790
majority is yeah so it's not so

00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:30,100
important and be sivanna whatever rules

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,190
we had we need to come to a decision

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,530
which we did yes that's where we are I

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,630
think this situation honestly is that

00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,640
the majority of topics that are brought

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,340
to the technical committee do end up

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,200
having a sense of consensus form around

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,930
them regardless of what the boundary

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,660
conditions are in the constitutional

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:52,150
voting rules the problem is that when we

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,690
have an issue that is as contentious as

00:10:52,150 --> 00:11:01,270
the one we dealt with a year or so ago

00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:02,620
the the the anxiety about those boundary

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,400
conditions just makes the whole thing

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,839
harder

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,390
so these are things that we will

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,460
eventually fix because we'd like to not

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,440
ever have any of our successors go

00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,089
through quite the same degree of stress

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:19,270
that we had to go through and definitely

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:22,270
that's kind of where that list yeah the

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:26,980
menu system one I'm not sure where that

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:30,580
currently stands I shouldn't with that

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,600
one is that there is a draft ballot in

00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,710
the last IRC meeting I raised concerns

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,970
so basically there's there's two views

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,540
within the committee at the moment

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:45,820
obviously there's you know there's a

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:47,380
fraud social issue with regards to was

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,490
this the right way for it to be handled

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,950
and then there's also the question of

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,170
what the technical policy should be and

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,779
different members of the technical

00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,330
committee come down in different

00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:59,830
directions on what what the the

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:04,480
committee as a whole should be focused

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,820
on when addressing this question and so

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,000
it was kind of left at the end of that

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:13,270
IRC meeting that I have the opportunity

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,270
to draft a ballot option that draws on

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:19,240
Keith's proposed technical solution and

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,740
get that on the ballot I also made it

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,480
clear during that meeting that I

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,640
couldn't promise I would get to that in

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,830
a timely manner in which case the vote

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,360
may go ahead with the current set of

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:33,220
ballot options yeah I you know I don't

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,860
know how we'll come down those this is

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,360
probably one of those topics about which

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,500
if there are folks in the room that have

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,120
strong opinions it could be an

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,740
interesting thing for us to have some

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:48,910
conversation about here not that we

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:52,420
haven't already had something and then I

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:54,279
guess the new item that was not present

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,850
on the list last year was the plan for

00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,650
cross toolchain packages I've lost track

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,260
of the current status of that we have

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:05,230
provided advice and mediation I don't

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,760
think that I believe at the moment this

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,390
is going to lead to the tech committee

00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,020
actually voting on something but I'm not

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:16,670
certain that what the current status is

00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,920
I would say they have made some blow

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:23,269
I believe that it's and probably we will

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,879
be voting on something like that we just

00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:28,730
to to formally answer topic sayings that

00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,860
we said we're happy to see some blockers

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:35,209
or something like that so but not a

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,639
decision voting right okay so with that

00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:39,860
I think we're more than happy to open

00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:53,230
things up to questions and I hope that

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:53,230
you have some interesting ones for us hi

00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:03,079
hi this is Andre I actually a question

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:06,050
related to past past issue what do you

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:08,839
if the other party its openly hostile

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:12,639
after the decision is made because if

00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:15,319
you remember we did a lot of jumping

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,759
before the GC released with the Lib JPEG

00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:22,639
transition because the decision didn't

00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,860
list exactly what to do and when I made

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,199
it the most reasonable thing it was not

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,750
met with success and we had to rename

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,509
the packages and and do a lot of weird

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:36,680
stuff because because the the other

00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:42,110
party what it was not well very warm in

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:44,569
regards of the decision when you guys

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,600
want to try and tackle that what happens

00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:49,610
when the party on the losing side of a

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,459
decision if you want to call it that is

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:56,329
not amenable to actually implementing

00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:58,910
what was directed I mean that's kind of

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:03,579
what yeah so I mean if we're clear about

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:06,079
what we've decided as a committee then

00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:08,689
no Debian developer has the authority to

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,660
act against such a decision and any

00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:16,129
member of the Technical Committee can do

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:18,980
an NMU to implement a decision and we've

00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:21,040
said that before that like in some cases

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,360
if there's a maintainer override that

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,399
maybe we should just be prepared to do

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,319
the NMU for it I think we probably

00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,360
haven't followed through on that yeah

00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:31,839
necessarily

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,519
basically I mean in cases in cases where

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,499
as a community accommodation resides

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,799
over Lulla maintain of course we don't

00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:40,540
do that light just just easily it's hard

00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,509
for us to do but if we do we think that

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:46,179
our decisions then is said to have a

00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:49,059
very good reason to do so and what I

00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:51,100
think or what we have be I ask every

00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:53,649
developer to say okay this is now our

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,790
policy which is set by the committee and

00:15:53,649 --> 00:16:00,399
then please extend this policy in an or

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,759
basically see our lease is for it and so

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,309
please try to see what we or try to

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,009
follow it up reasonably so we don't have

00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:10,720
said could be because it could be a part

00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,699
we didn't spell out know the solution

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,189
but basically trust it depleted

00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:17,170
meaningfully and not oh yes this is

00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:18,879
exactly the Lord if and says a small

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,769
passage I could go through without being

00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,350
punished because it's not the way we

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:26,079
write our text write our text more

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:29,339
intentional specification and not a soul

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,809
please yeah I treat it as it you think

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,489
it's sensible that I mean if you say

00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:35,709
well you think something is very wrong

00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:38,980
in our solution for example you think we

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:41,139
need to do this and be a forbidden to do

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,850
that in a specific way that doesn't mean

00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:45,629
that you should do it now another way

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,459
but that we don't want to have it except

00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:50,709
except if we specified otherwise and if

00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:53,559
you have doubt please ask us first so I

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:55,989
think it was I wasn't an issue in the

00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:58,239
past every way explicitly forbid

00:16:55,989 --> 00:17:00,489
something and then was done in a in a

00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:02,739
similar but not not attacked forbidden

00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:05,169
way which is of course not what we what

00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:09,309
we meant so so that of course speaks to

00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:10,980
the case of a maintainer being shall we

00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:17,649
say unconstructive either in their

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:20,589
interpretation of unconstructive but I

00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:22,299
think the question here was about well

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,839
or at least one aspect of the question

00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:27,339
is you know the Technical Committee can

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,289
say what the policy should be for the

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,899
archive the Technical Committee cannot

00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:34,330
make any member of the Debian project do

00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:38,350
the work to implement that right and so

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:40,090
ultimately if we make a decision that

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,360
does effectively authorize the other

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:46,040
party to do and you

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,270
if they are inclined to do so or they

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,030
can ask the technical committee to

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,760
actually do the archive upload but I

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:55,460
think in some cases where the resolution

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,290
of the issue sort of involved providing

00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,420
advice and guidance to the archive

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:01,460
maintainer is on what to accept or not

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:05,240
accept or you know something like that

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,590
so yeah I think Steve makes a really

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,880
excellent point here and this is

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,950
something that we had a lot of

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,010
discussion about within the committee

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,990
during the init system debate and that

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,630
is that there's sort of a distinction

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,090
between making a decision about what the

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,090
right solution is or the thing that we

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,500
would most like to see happen and the

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,929
fact that we don't really have the

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,770
authority to make anybody do any actual

00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:33,710
work because we are all in Debian

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,059
volunteers we're here for lots of

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,610
different reasons lots of different

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:39,320
motivations some of us get paid more

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:43,160
than others to do the things that we do

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,230
for Debian but nobody in Debian has the

00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,340
right to tell somebody else what to do

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:52,040
you can say this is the right solution

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,960
that one's the wrong solution and if the

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,520
only thing that you want to do is the

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,460
thing that was the wrong solution sorry

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,669
you lose but we can't make people do

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:04,400
work and given that it does put some

00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:06,230
constraints on this it means that any

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,970
solution that's proposed somebody has to

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,150
willing be willing to actually do the

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:14,390
work to implement it and you know if we

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,820
run into situations where a decision is

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,820
rendered and one of the folks involved

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,470
believes that somebody's being actively

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,150
obstructionist about it then we ought to

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,400
have some further conversation about

00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,110
that there are certainly other things

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,320
the project can do to try and correct

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:34,360
situations where somebody's actively

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:36,620
obstructing progress in the archive but

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:41,830
I'm not really sure what else we would

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,830
say productively about that yeah

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:51,530
so the obvious follow-up question would

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:54,050
be should i well continue discussion for

00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:56,810
the issue before or should I open a new

00:19:54,050 --> 00:20:00,500
issue if I want to clean up the mess

00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:04,040
that was created during the transition

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,710
like having lipped JPEG turbo instead of

00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:10,220
Prague's instead of just live JPEG

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:13,900
brogues and and the other stuff that was

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,640
created so the this is the preferred

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,950
resolution would always be that you come

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,720
up with some plan to do that kind of

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,580
cleanup straightening up making things

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,260
right again without having to come to

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,320
the tech committee for a decision right

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,030
and if it's possible to work with other

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,000
people in the project to achieve those

00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:35,090
objectives great if you can't then yes

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,920
if if the situation is different now

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,380
but there's a new issue that ought to be

00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,940
resolved open a new new bug and let's

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,880
have that conversation in the committee

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,910
there's no problem with that at all if

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,400
the issue if the underlying issue really

00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:52,730
is fundamentally one or more individuals

00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,110
trying to obstruct the decision a

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,090
decision that the committee is already

00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,590
taken then that's something that we

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:03,350
probably need to have a conversation

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:05,420
with the DPL about and or you know the

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,400
remedies provided by our Constitution

00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,100
are sort of interesting you know if we

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,820
we have somebody who's really behaving

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:16,190
badly you know the ultimate choice is to

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,270
evict victim from the project that's a

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:22,400
pretty big hammer it's been used a

00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:24,920
couple of times in the past we don't use

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,140
that one lightly that's a much harder

00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:32,030
hammer to swing than even making a tech

00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:34,190
committee decision so honestly and and

00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,600
so I think sometimes we have to think a

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,850
little bit about what is it we really

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,700
want to accomplish and in your case if

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:43,250
there is some path to achieving you know

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,600
the right technical solution without

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,150
having to jump through a lot of

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,530
procedural hoops ie without having to

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,150
come to the tech committee or go to the

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,000
DPL to complain about somebody's

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,980
behavior or something like this great

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,880
but if there are things that are getting

00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,919
in the way of

00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,440
being able to make progress in Debian

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,480
and be successful then don't be afraid

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:09,340
to come get help because that's what

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:11,690
we're here for other questions yeah

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,480
should Devon have a technical committee

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,490
that although engages in designing and

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,630
planning stuff and something that is

00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:22,160
currently forbidden by the Constitution

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:25,700
I assume you have an opinion it's just a

00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,650
question it's a question with the idea

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:33,110
of we can't make people do something

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:37,090
idea so I've always personally thought

00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:40,539
that there is definitely room for

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:44,450
leadership within a project like Debian

00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:47,870
when I was running for and successfully

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,570
elected to be DPL I spent a lot of time

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,669
thinking about who ought to sort of have

00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:55,490
what roles and responsibilities where

00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:57,440
and I articulated at that time that I

00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:01,669
thought one of the things the DPL could

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,890
do is to shine a light on areas that

00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:06,620
they thought needed more attention or

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,289
where more hands would make things work

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,799
well way back in the day when I was

00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:14,230
running for DPL the big issues were

00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:16,520
internationalization and the Installer I

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,860
forget what else there were several

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,110
issues where I thought okay if I talk

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,640
about this and I talked about it being

00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,650
important and more people want to work

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,530
on it that would cause a positive thing

00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:30,190
to happen I believe that we have spent a

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:33,380
lot of time trying to figure out how to

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,780
think of the technical committee as an

00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:40,340
organization that exists only to sort of

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:43,789
make decisions of last resort because if

00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,280
you get really proactive about trying to

00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:48,710
sort of make decisions in advance

00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,650
you really constrain the sense of what

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:54,559
people think they can work on and in a

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:57,380
place like Debian that is as much a duoc

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,419
recei as we are meaning the people who

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:03,080
are actually willing to do the work get

00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:05,440
to sort of in some way define what the

00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,500
the technical direction is

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,480
it it's it's it's dispiriting if the

00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,179
thing you care about turns out to not be

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,669
one of the things that gets laid out as

00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:17,350
part of a vision or articulated so I

00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:20,200
personally have gone back and forth on

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,929
this I don't know whether it's important

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,080
for the Technical Committee to be the

00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:28,149
place where you know the sort of big

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,970
design decisions about the future get

00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:33,309
made but I would like somehow somewhere

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:36,610
in the project there to be some sense of

00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:39,340
what the objectives are what the vision

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,139
is what the opportunities are what the

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,899
things are that we could do if we just

00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:46,029
cared enough to go work on them actually

00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,830
I think it's really a feature that II

00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:50,169
know probably doesn't lose the sign work

00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:53,649
because if you do the sign work and then

00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:55,509
have ideas that are not popular as a

00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:57,220
project and then who - for - the

00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:58,960
decisions of one who likes addressed in

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,240
the design not a good idea

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,649
on the other hand there are places in

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,529
the portrait where we could do design

00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:08,110
work for examples as a policy team which

00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:10,090
could be more involved if they would

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:12,250
have time and would like to do it there

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,080
are lots of other places so if somebody

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,389
says okay as a group of you of people

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,980
says you want to do more aside work and

00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,590
it shows that it's helpful for the

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,779
project I'm grateful to get support from

00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,610
all over the project and say could do

00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:26,980
improve or could influence the project

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,769
but I don't think there's a comity Boop

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,309
is appropriate place for that yeah so

00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:35,159
I'll say that I have never interpreted

00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:38,620
the Constitution's wording about

00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:42,850
detailed design work as a prohibition as

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:44,980
opposed to a statement that this is not

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,289
the work that the project should expect

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,139
from the committee so I think I think

00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:51,639
there has been a view that at various

00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:54,789
points I feel has hamstrung the

00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:58,149
committee in in resolving some issues

00:25:54,789 --> 00:26:00,399
where there was a contentious issue and

00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:06,580
it needed somebody to actually dig into

00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:10,960
it and and and suss out the the the true

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,950
technical right answer there they said

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,629
that there is such a thing there have

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,360
been times when the question was you

00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:18,009
know should we do a or B and the members

00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,600
of the technical committee looked at it

00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,789
and went

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,710
that's a bad choice to have to make

00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:25,320
because neither one of those is really

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,419
good it would be better if we did

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,490
something else and the temptation then

00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:32,610
is to go start thinking about what the

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:35,429
right answer is and I think this is

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:37,559
where the tension exists in the actual

00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:39,690
existing practices of the committee is

00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,730
when is it okay for us to think beyond

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,519
the question that was actually asked of

00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:47,639
us and when things get complicated and

00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,649
messy my tendency always is to want to

00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,240
step back and say okay what was the

00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,950
question that we were originally asked

00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,259
what what are we actually supposed to be

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,990
making a decision about and sometimes

00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:01,200
that help simplify things sometimes it

00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,059
really doesn't but in this case I think

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,940
we're really it sort of depends on what

00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:11,009
you mean I I don't there are there's

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,769
sort of a distinction in my mind between

00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:15,840
engaging in some design activity in the

00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:18,450
process of answering a question that's

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,899
brought to the committee versus a

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,610
situation of gee you know who's the body

00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,919
that's supposed to sort of provide the

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,799
vision for the future I will admit that

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,789
I've been disappointed in the last

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,879
several DPL election cycles that our

00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:39,659
platforms haven't had more long-range

00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:41,700
vision content I am of course really

00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,399
pleased every time I read somebody's

00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:48,179
platform and recognize verbage that I

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:50,070
authored in 2002 because I like thinking

00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:52,169
that you know ideas that I had were

00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,779
collected from other people and took as

00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:57,570
my own have you know become part of the

00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:01,019
culture of the project but when I don't

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:03,899
see something new and shiny to aspire to

00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:05,820
I'm a little disappointed and so you

00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:08,159
know maybe in the future folks writing

00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,809
DPO platforms might think about you know

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,629
what would cause be able to get

00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:13,980
enthusiastic again and add that to your

00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:17,580
list of things to worry about

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,259
we're not I'm only one vote right but I

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,850
don't know it's a really good question

00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:23,149
if you have an opinion or others in the

00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:26,429
room have an opinion about this speak up

00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:28,860
and of course it's a constitution

00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,240
similar to you so it's not that I said I

00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,160
personally must not do this I'm

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,020
definitely not in it you know

00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,910
the villa's committee we sometimes we do

00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,460
take our people look at things and say

00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:41,070
okay now sis is wrong and that s one

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,120
other reason is another way to do it but

00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,850
I don't think that we should be the

00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,280
group of people who actively drive some

00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,970
solution how they look like set someone

00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,640
up for it

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,050
but sometimes as there is an overlap of

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,380
people who are in the committee who

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:57,090
would otherwise do that and that's great

00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:00,090
right and also when you get right down

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:03,060
to it even even if the folks who were on

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,820
the committee had the desire to try to

00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,860
impose some sort of top-down vision for

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,720
Debian which I don't think anybody who

00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,760
has ever been elected to the committee

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,770
has viewed it that way

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,460
most of the time the people who are

00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:19,650
sitting on the committee find it enough

00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,550
work to keep up with the issues that are

00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,800
actually brought to the committee

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,620
without going looking for more work as

00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,060
the committee you know you might have

00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,230
individual members who are still out

00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,080
there participating in design

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:36,960
discussions in the mailing lists in

00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:38,610
Debian developers as peers which is

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,620
quite a different thing than trying to

00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,270
get a resolution passed by the committee

00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,730
to say that this is a thing that Debian

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,490
should do which is just that's just

00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:51,180
overhead I would also like to suggest

00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:53,340
that those of you that have a strong

00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,750
interest in the Technical Committee and

00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,440
have been around the project for a while

00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:00,210
and done some useful things take note of

00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,040
the fact that at the end of this

00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,480
calendar year there will be two

00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,550
positions on the committee that are

00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,010
becoming open so that means that

00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,660
sometime this fall

00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,760
will put out a call for you know

00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,260
nominations self nominations whatever of

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,270
people who might be interested in

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,830
serving on the technical community and

00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:19,020
committee starting in January I

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,580
certainly hope the committee rest of the

00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,620
committee doesn't decide to wait until

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,980
January to start that process and so I

00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,300
would encourage all of you to have

00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,760
conversations with your friends and

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,620
peers here at DEFCON about what do you

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,340
think's important what would you like to

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:37,740
see happen differently I don't want to

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,780
sort of specifically speak for anybody

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,850
else but I know that Sam Hartman has

00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:45,120
been very clear about the fact that he

00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,630
thinks there are some things about how

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,789
there

00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:50,820
current committee membership has behaved

00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:54,120
that he'd like to see us do differently

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,220
and he's been very willing to engage in

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,590
conversation and I really have welcomed

00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,559
his input into those discussions even if

00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:05,190
sometimes we're approaching a situation

00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:07,169
from very different viewpoints and maybe

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:11,520
once your term has expired you can run

00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:13,289
for DPL again I told somebody once that

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,240
the problem with me running for DPL is

00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:17,640
that the two times I ran and was not

00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,870
elected each time I got a newer bigger

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,880
job at HP and no Beca HP so it would

00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,950
look again yeah when I'm already a

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,110
fellow in the office of the CTO the the

00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:31,429
the anything I could go do up from here

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:36,150
just is too much responsibility so I

00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:37,530
don't know that feels dangerous so you

00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,419
take a much more laid-back approach to

00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,010
this question of thinking about the

00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,480
nominations I was gonna say I was gonna

00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,789
let people know that the doors are gonna

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,679
be locked at the end of 45 minutes and

00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:54,809
nobody's allowed out until they come up

00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:56,220
with four nominees and you'd be allowed

00:31:54,809 --> 00:32:00,690
to nominate people not in the room by

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:03,750
the way too so the process we've used

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,500
the last couple times just you know for

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,270
those of you haven't been paying

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,789
attention the process we've we used as

00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:11,340
we put out a call for nominations people

00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:12,960
have nominated themselves or others the

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,000
people who did not nominate themselves

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,159
we've checked with them to find out if

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,820
they were okay with being nominated and

00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:23,039
then and interestingly a number of

00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,710
people who were nominated said nope not

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,440
on your life for different reasons and

00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:30,240
that's fine and then the technical

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,820
committees had a private discussion

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,919
about the merits of including each of

00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,039
those individuals on the committee while

00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,710
as a project we are intensely focused on

00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:43,770
being open about all the things we do in

00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:46,890
all honesty the kinds of conversations

00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:48,659
we're having about people who were

00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:52,200
nominated are just not appropriate for a

00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:53,280
public list and so that's the way that

00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,220
process has worked

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,980
we then always take the slate of

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,500
candidates that we are considering

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,860
and put them to a publicly visible vote

00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:08,010
before they're taken to the project

00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,440
leader for review and approval and so I

00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:14,130
think that combination has worked out

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,889
pretty well but again I would strongly

00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:19,169
encourage any of you who think you might

00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:22,590
have something add in the committee

00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:24,299
context to consider nominating yourself

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,820
for nominating somebody else you think's

00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:28,889
appropriate it's honestly not a lot of

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,210
work for us to contact people and ask if

00:33:28,889 --> 00:33:31,980
they're willing to be considered as

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:34,620
nominees we're more than happy to do

00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,210
that so if you have a list of people you

00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,860
think might be interesting to see on the

00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:41,220
committee don't be afraid to give us the

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:44,100
list just something in addition to what

00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,860
you said at least since the last time we

00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,480
had more people in our basically a list

00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,880
of people we are discussing about us as

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,630
a people who is a safe nominated SEMO I

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,250
accept the nomination and then not the

00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,720
list of people who were now added to the

00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,639
committee is not the full list of people

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,830
who coincide except table but don't

00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:03,779
sings because you're nominated and not

00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:08,609
accepted that we consign was non

00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:10,200
acceptable where so but if we don't want

00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:12,329
to make the decision public which

00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,919
nominees we consign tell them it's not

00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:15,599
in the hopes that is okay well I

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,629
personally wouldn't like to go to that

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,310
there's another comment I'll add there

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:23,790
yes give give the tech committee your

00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,960
nominations but also if there are people

00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:27,270
that you think would be good on the

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,849
technical committee don't be afraid to

00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:32,310
talk to them yes about it as well

00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,659
because if if they only see that from

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,879
from the technical committee

00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,899
I think it's possibly they view it

00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,780
differently than if they get it from

00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:42,270
their peers and I can show you in the

00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,530
last cycle the folks who said no had

00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:46,560
strong reasons for saying though that

00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,389
were unrelated to where the nomination

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,619
was coming from but your points are

00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:55,800
really good one this is this is we are

00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:58,950
in Debian a social organization on some

00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,349
level and people understanding the sense

00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:04,619
of value that you place on their

00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:06,270
opinions and interests and you know in

00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:09,030
fact bolstering their willingness to

00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,300
take one for the team and go do

00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:14,260
something that

00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:17,410
is at best some work and at worst really

00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:20,320
really stressful is probably a great

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:24,070
thing to do and frankly I suspect that

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,680
in the next few years I hope we don't

00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,390
have any more situations like we did

00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,010
around the Annette system discussion

00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:35,020
that was that was the single most

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,610
unusual and contentious issue the

00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:44,320
Technical Committee has ever dealt with

00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:47,020
and it's not just a bit but it's not the

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,730
order of magnitude difference I was

00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,050
going to put the issue before the

00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,060
technically need to ask if we should

00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:57,990
switch from the Linux to a bsd kernel by

00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:59,830
default do you think your question I

00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:03,400
suspect the committee would come to

00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:06,370
consensus on that fairly quickly vote

00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:09,070
feel free you know I'm sure I'm sure you

00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:14,260
know nope sorry I won't still be around

00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:14,830
next April well sorry any other

00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:22,330
questions

00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:26,680
oh come on 20 minutes left so we can't

00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:30,130
finish it early oh we can okay I have

00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,720
seen an ex-member not actually 20

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,870
minutes we're supposed to end early and

00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,340
let the camera people go home I had a so

00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,770
I noticed there was this this business

00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:44,020
with the cross tool chain stuff and I

00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:47,230
read that bug report and it it really it

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:49,420
was that the initial referral to the TC

00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:52,750
was was a beautiful piece of writing and

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,630
really in other circumstances you would

00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:59,260
have been you know uplifted by it but

00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:04,950
the facts that were revealed in that bug

00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:08,230
report were disturbing and I worry that

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:12,730
males like that are saying not generally

00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:16,080
sent the TC because the person who would

00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:18,400
want to send such a mail fears that the

00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,960
relationship with the maintainer that

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,190
they're complaining about will be even

00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,780
further damaged by

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:30,039
and I would like to ask the TC members

00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:32,920
what suggestions they have for people

00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:35,859
who are in that position and what they

00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:41,170
are going to do to make that problem

00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:43,720
easier well if you have an issue that

00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,220
might be long before full of technical

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,329
material basically where you need help

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:51,549
you could contact any of us off list

00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:54,130
which means with a private email so it's

00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:57,430
also a non public mailing list force

00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:59,680
committee so we could forward things so

00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:03,460
please if you if you si okay it's a

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,049
difficult issue in that packet part it's

00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,640
basically in disagreement between the

00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:11,349
maintain and a COO of other people on

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:14,049
how to behave or how to address certain

00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:18,730
topics which is I agree with you

00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:20,470
submissive mail it's not so nice so yeah

00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:23,710
please contact us

00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:25,990
private and we will provide other means

00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:29,020
of communications when where we hope to

00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:31,180
make it it's less difficult for the

00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,010
maintainer as possible of course it soon

00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,799
as somebody else starts speaking with

00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:38,589
the maintainer yeah I mean this

00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:40,059
basically a social conflict involved not

00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:43,059
only changing it but our social in some

00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:44,799
cases in some of the conflicts we can't

00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:48,339
ruin her try to hit as good as we could

00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:52,210
but none of us is now on it's now and

00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:53,680
let's say none of us works as sort of a

00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,970
conflict so ever but you all have

00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,730
technical roles so yeah we can try to do

00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:03,089
our best but and if you want to discuss

00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:05,559
it off list you can you can of course I

00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:07,660
was just going to say that the reality

00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,089
is that this has been happening a lot

00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,609
for a long time there are a lot of

00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:15,190
things at least I've had people come and

00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:16,750
ask me questions about gee how do you

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,400
think I should handle this you know do

00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,799
you have some advice or guidance that

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,170
you could give me about this on topics

00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:25,510
many of which have never ended up you

00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,789
know being publicly surfaced in fact I

00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,589
realized at the end of the one-year term

00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:31,329
that I spent as Debian project leader

00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:32,069
that one of the problems was so many of

00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:33,719
the things that

00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,279
brought to me during that year were

00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:37,469
things that we found some quiet

00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:39,239
resolution to that I think people

00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:41,729
looking at my term in office went well

00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:44,219
didn't do a damn thing now did he and

00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:46,619
there's a tension there somehow because

00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:50,190
it would be really good if everyone in

00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:52,969
the project understood that there were

00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:55,199
avenues that you could pursue to have

00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:58,019
you know get some advice and guidance

00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:00,119
and maybe help resolve a problem but

00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:04,049
it's hard to know how to sort of

00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:06,089
publicize quiet resolutions being

00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:08,549
successful at least I've never really

00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:10,680
figured out a good way to do it without

00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:13,890
somehow seeming horribly self-serving in

00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,690
the process and so you know we've

00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:17,430
certainly talked about and I know over

00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:19,920
the last two or three years we've a

00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:22,969
couple times in other Deb Krunk

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,529
tech committee Bobson and other venues

00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:27,449
espouse the opinion that people want to

00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:28,769
approach us as Andy just said and in

00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:30,779
other ways we're happy to have that

00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:34,079
happen I'm happy to just say that here

00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:36,180
again today if any of you have some

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,009
frustration that's you know bubbling up

00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,930
and you just don't really know how to

00:40:38,009 --> 00:40:42,239
make things better instead of making

00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,680
things worse with an email come find of

00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,239
one of us this week and let's have a

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,109
conversation and see if we can't help

00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:51,269
you figure out how to make some progress

00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:52,920
remember at least one case where the

00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:54,719
discussion ended up in and special

00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,499
perform that the owner Deb conveyed by

00:40:54,719 --> 00:41:01,109
Vaughn a potential committee members to

00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:03,479
were motivated by one of them to get

00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:08,369
both parties starting to agree at least

00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:10,170
a bit yeah we could do that we have we

00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:12,660
have in fact approached third party

00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,009
sometime where we knew the two folks in

00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,930
question who were having some kind of

00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:17,999
conflict we're going to be at the same

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:20,579
event that wasn't a debian event and

00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:22,319
have asked somebody else to you know

00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:24,509
would they be willing to sit and sort of

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,839
moderate a face-to-face conversation

00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:30,269
between those folks and I certainly have

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,890
personally offered to throw some cash on

00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:33,269
the table to cover the cost of some

00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,880
beers or something if that would help

00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:37,969
lubricate the conversation and you know

00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,769
things like that do help sometimes

00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:43,380
because again you know part of the

00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:44,410
reason that I have for so long been such

00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,510
a strong support

00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:48,370
the idea of getting good corporate

00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:51,940
sponsorship for Deb cons and for other

00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:53,380
events like this it's I know that those

00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,090
of us who have a chance to come to

00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,550
events like this and get to know each

00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:00,210
other and have some meals together have

00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:03,340
some drinks together you know form

00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:05,920
personal social relationships just don't

00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,930
have the ability to fight with each

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,060
other in the same way as people who've

00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:12,160
never met in any way other than an

00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,860
online communication and I think that's

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,600
really important and so part of what

00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,220
I've certainly tried to do over the

00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,370
years is look for as many opportunities

00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:24,280
as possible to get people to communicate

00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:26,170
with each other better and sometimes you

00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,120
know that's by asking you know a calm

00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,160
third party to invite them both to go to

00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:33,040
dinner somewhere or something and

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,960
sometimes it's been by sending an email

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,940
to somebody and saying do you really

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,010
have any idea just how what you're

00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,750
saying publicly is being perceived you

00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,030
know have you thought about sort of how

00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:44,950
the other person feels about this and

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:46,000
why what you're saying is making things

00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:48,580
worse instead of better

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,380
we do a lot of that and I guess it's

00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,370
probably thanks for the question yeah

00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,650
because I think it's probably worth

00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:56,110
saying out loud here that you know I

00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:58,300
know I do and I know that Annie and

00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:00,520
Steve have talked about examples too I

00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,470
think I think all of us on the committee

00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,180
at one time or another have those sorts

00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:07,030
of interactions with people we hope they

00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:09,760
make things better and honestly well I'm

00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:11,530
totally happy for us to have more items

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,020
come to the committee that need to be

00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:16,420
addressed by the committee I'm every bit

00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,790
as happy maybe even happier if the

00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,990
project just works well without issues

00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:21,910
having to be brought to the committee

00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:25,780
because that's what we all want we want

00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:27,250
somehow to be able to collaborate in an

00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,880
efficient and effective way with each

00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:37,090
other to make the world a better place

00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:39,910
other questions yeah so can I buy next

00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:44,860
step conf be policy compliant by

00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:46,390
ignoring the Debian menu I'm sorry I

00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,030
didn't quite understand the question

00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:51,540
can I buy next that kind of be policy

00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:53,520
compliant by ignoring the Debian menu

00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:57,440
good question

00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:00,450
you see that I don't be altered about it

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,280
have you looked over the the draft

00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:04,380
policy language that Keith had started

00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,670
putting together on this I haven't

00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:11,130
reviewed it recently myself so I can't

00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:13,020
correct it's in the get it's it's in the

00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,250
the technical companies get repository

00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:22,590
as a draft it's not been sent to any

00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:24,990
mailing lists yet well it certainly is

00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,310
he it should be published so so he's

00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,410
wind waiting for that I'm just saying

00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:31,010
that in terms of of what the answer to

00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:33,810
your specific question is I don't recall

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:37,290
what it was that Keith recommended there

00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:42,600
to address the particulars I do think

00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:44,340
that ultimately yes the answer should be

00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,850
that yes you should not have to interact

00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:51,210
with two menu systems in your package

00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:53,850
however there's details about how the

00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:56,340
system should treat those two menu

00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:58,650
systems to ensure compatibility and

00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:04,470
ensure that the system can use working

00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:07,050
for our users and not just I understand

00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:09,390
the viewpoint that the menu system is is

00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,680
not something that maintain errs of

00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:14,820
packages that interface with the free

00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,440
desktop system want to be dealing with

00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:19,230
however just dropping it on the floor

00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,810
has impact for other places where we

00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,640
have integration today so but it is a

00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,920
part I think it would be helpful if you

00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:29,430
could review what is what is it laughs

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,580
and if you don't find it they sent an

00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:35,160
email to say to me I didn't - any of us

00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,630
and we can send you the text because so

00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,130
I actually smell an action item here we

00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,520
should probably go to the tech

00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:44,280
committee's page in the w.org stuff and

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,890
make sure there's a explicit pointer to

00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,260
our repo and an invitation to people to

00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:51,090
review drafts there because I don't know

00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,950
that we've ever officially done that we

00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,120
sort of created a git repo at some point

00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,370
because it was the obvious way to

00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,070
collaborate on creating drafts of new

00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:01,080
documents but even I sometimes have to

00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:04,230
stop and go oh yeah right it's probably

00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,440
in the repo so we could probably make

00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:09,640
that a little more

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,609
on the webpage yeah yeah I'll I'll try

00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:18,069
and remember to do that this evening

00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:19,990
any other questions okay then thank you

00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:21,630
all for showing up yes thank you very

00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:25,860
much

00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:25,860
