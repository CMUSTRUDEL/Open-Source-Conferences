00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,439
talk about devon at free software events

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,360
here in brazil like phase they let you

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,799

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,759
body

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,280
depend day last weekend we

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:37,119
we had had one

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,560
so and we had a

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,119
recently a special for us here so

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,119
in may

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,799
stay home

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,560
it was a

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,600
a month uh all night we

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,360
with what talk about

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:09,200
daphne of course and our

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,879
dub in brazil youtube channel

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,080
where people can give a

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,080
talk and help people

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,200
across this moment

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,400
and this just pandemic way

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,760
so it's an our

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,599
way to help people and some

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,640
some kind some kind of help people

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,480
so i want to

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,519
contribute more stabbing and

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,599
looking ways to contribute i'm

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:53,280
not a programmer professional

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,879
so i started to learn

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,519
to package so

00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,519
why package

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,959
kind of obvious that debian is based

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:11,040
on packets so after

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,040
that i package this

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,440
and this is extra tourism is basic

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,040
package so you need to understand how it

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,640
works so if you

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,239
understand how how packets

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,360
works how how it was

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,599
how we need to do so you can

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,799
understand everything better in devon

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,319
so it's helped him help him

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,519
a lot to understand devin's side

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,519
so it's a good a good choice

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,799
choice i i have done

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,159
during this just i

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,200
study i discover that package it's not a

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,280
trivial task

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:07,599
of course to build a

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:12,080
pinner tab is easy

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,080
but not to put in a dabbing shape

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,199
to be ready to go to debian

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,079
repository it's another store you have

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,840
to

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:27,680
follow a set of rules

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,199
okay so you have a lot of

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,560
documents to read so

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,160
we will be better prepared to read a lot

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,759
or to talk a lot of people to understand

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:46,800
how how things works

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:50,240
the first things you have to

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:54,000
dab in debian sites has

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,639
almost everything you need so in

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,639
inside that the inside so had a

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,160
a section the valve section

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,199
so you have uh find

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,320
almost there so

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,400
we call deb in the developer's corner

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:20,240
so you type in the target slash develop

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:24,000
you can find out guys

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,759
manual stairs so you can go

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,800
through there and the first

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,720
manual guide kill that you have to

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,000
read is debian new montana's guide

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,600
that is a full guide

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,880
where you can find final information

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,560
that you can

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,320
can find about to package

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:56,240
your find where you can find source

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,840
code where how you build the packaging

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:05,199
how you uh where you can put your

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:08,960
files how you

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,639
scrap write you

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,680
copyright correctly how you write

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:20,960
write your watch finally

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:24,880
that's information that you need

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,840
everything it's uh

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,960
it's in the building monitoring sky with

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,639
examples

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:36,160
to you so you go there

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,199
and read it it's along with reads and

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,199
it's not easy but

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,639
the package and not at reveal task

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,639
so be prepared

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,039
another document that is important is

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,919
that that bin

00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:01,440
developers have friends and it's

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,160
more for the footer but it's important

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,199
to

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,599
know about that and it's approached

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:13,199
how to rename a package how to upload

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:16,639
how to to change a

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,160
name things inside

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,280
packages it's kind of things inside

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,720
so it's good to

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,840
to read and understand how how things

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,120
works

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,400
so take taken notes and

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,520
and good to

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,039
to take to take a look inside the

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,680
document

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,440
and another is deven policy it's

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,800
essential to

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:52,080
to read and understand this

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,080
it's this document will

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,919
will guide you through the

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:04,560
how things works for the package

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,560
how package will lead with the

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:13,039
extruder how files will

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,560
so with each package it has to know

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,639
how how thing how things

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,680
will works so if few packages are

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,840
in the 398

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
version kingdoms works

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,360
in a way if you aren't using a

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,360
new version for firefight for five

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:45,440
zero of course it's working a new way

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:50,560
uh so yeah a new set of rules

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:53,760
are applying in this this package

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,040
uh anytime if if you have

00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:01,120
any question you can use the

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,160
channel on rsc device mentors

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,440
so ask

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,480
for help and yes

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,519
always have someone to help you or

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,720
you can i can

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:22,560
ask for help in the email list

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:26,000
mentors listwn.org

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,200
and at the same time thingy always have

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,200
someone to help you

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:37,839
and another place that

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,839
you can find information that i

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,080
the important site for me as a lot of

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,440
information about package

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,200
that's maintained by ediberto it's a

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,120
brazilian dd

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:03,279
and it's a lot of

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,480
videos teaching how to package

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,760
and for a set of

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:14,480
instructions too and

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,480
unfortunately it's in portuguese but

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,320
you can you can follow

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:26,320
the video ignore the audio

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:30,399
and see how how things are

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,399
mean so you can see

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,600
doing things and they're trying to

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,920
understand

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,279
uh after breathing develops guide

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,480
probably you understand a lot of what

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:48,480
he's doing so if you

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:53,680
are like me that learn better by sign

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,680
and having video could help you a lot

00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,959
of course portuguese could you not

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,760
understand but you can looking at the

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,120
comments

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,680
could you help you to understand

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
something

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:14,399
that you can't understand well

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:18,160
in the debian new monthly numbers guide

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,800
so i of course i have in 20 minutes i

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,320
can

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,079
teach you how to do a package if you

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,200
watch the the video see that is

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:33,360
more than an hour maybe three hours

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:37,120
some some videos so i will just

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,240
collect some tips that i

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,760
i'm not taking notes so

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:48,000
maybe i can help you in this moment

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:51,120
and we can talk afterwards maybe

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,160
and the best

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,000
one one tips that

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,440
some someone told me in the

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,959
the beginning is not uh to adopt

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,959
the block

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:12,240
as in the start

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,600
try to to start with ka quality

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,040
assurance

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:21,040
uh quality assurance is just to do

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:24,079
upon two things in the package

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,680
for example as i say

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:33,120
a package could be in the devin polish

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:36,560
398 you could go and just

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,000
bump it to for

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,120
a new a new version for four five

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,839
zero so you just just

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:52,079
one and a great thing for the package

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,680
so you go and do a point out thing and

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,680
as you

00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,959
like i think you do you know how to do

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,959
it's a package

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,160
task so you go it's a

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,200
usual usually it's done in our phone

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,399
package

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,920
so you can you can't do a

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:19,360
key job in a package

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,560
that is a maintainer only in

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:26,320
in package that is our phone so

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,680
please take care about this

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,560
another tip is try to solve small

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:37,200
incidents first

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:40,240
when you are working in your

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,519
package when you build it

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,279
you you see a lot of legends uh

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,320
there's uh information

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:55,120
about what is need to be

00:13:50,320 --> 00:14:00,240
correct in your package should be

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,240
okay to that so if you

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:07,680
solve what is easier or faster

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,839
first psychology

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,839
effect stay that is you

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:20,240
can do a better job

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:23,279
and try to write a good change log

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,720
and try and don't forget

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:30,399
to register

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:34,160
change and change log and when you

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:37,600
maintain resist

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,600
everything in changing logs

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,399
is good for the future

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,920
it's a kind of difficult to discover and

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,959
what

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,440
what maintainer intend to to do if you

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,680
don't register correct and change your

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
log

00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,880
for example today you know how you

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,399
what you are doing past

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:08,000
three or four years you maybe

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:11,440
you forgot you are working

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,040
in another jobs and you forgot what you

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,040
intend to do so

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,760
if you write it correct

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,240
it's it's good to remember or another

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,240
people who you work in the in this

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
package

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
and spending time you learn about

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,160
license

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:40,320
so you to put correcting

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:44,639
in that bin you need to to know that

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:48,320
respect this complies with the fscg

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,440
so not always license check

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,639
will say that license

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,399
is correct maybe it's an annual license

00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,480
or

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:04,160
license that license check don't know

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:08,079
so you feel it's important to

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,600
to understand correctly how license is

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:15,040
works so it's important to

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,360
just spend the time to understand this

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,519
and create a checklist so

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,360

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,440
you do everything

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,600
do a checklist to to see if you

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
don't do anything wrong so if

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:43,680

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,839

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:51,519
