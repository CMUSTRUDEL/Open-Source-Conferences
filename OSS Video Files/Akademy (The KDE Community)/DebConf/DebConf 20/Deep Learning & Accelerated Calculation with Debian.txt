Artificial Intelligence is a world-wide trend of technology development, where
deep learning manifests its promising power on solving problems impossible for
traditional algorithms to solve. Yet powerful, the artificial intelligent software
deeply rely on hardware computational capability and software optimization. Thus,
the artificial intelligence software are highly related with computation acceleration.

This talk will focus on summarizing the current status of deep learning framework
packaging in Debian, and that of the computation acceleration libraries (e.g. BLAS/LAPACK
and ROCm). The existing problems and challenges will also be summarized.

I'm not physically attending the conference. So this will be a pre-recorded video.
