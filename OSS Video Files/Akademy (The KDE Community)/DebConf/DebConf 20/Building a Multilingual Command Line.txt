A multilingual command-line allows the users to interact with the computers from the command-line in multiple languages. Up until now, the command-line interface mostly had commands that are more or less English-like or have mnemonics made out of English words. This makes it difficult for new command-line users, who are also non-English speakers to use this interface. Thus the major question is how to help non-English speakers to work with the command-line interface in their native languages. Is there a need to rewrite the command-line emulators so that they can support multiple human languages? This talk will present the different ways to extend the command line for interaction in multiple languages.
