Initiate trainings that perpetuate themselves.  Introducting a community-organizing method I have used, also anecdotes from other communities.  Similar to [each-one-teach-one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Each_one_teach_one) but faster, a [grassroots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots) method called [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_peer-to-peer_processes) education.  A small group can get things rolling and the larger community benefits.  

For Debian community, skills training might best include good governance processes, moderation, conflict resolution, meeting-efficiency or similar topics.  Debian already depends on overlapping group projects supporting a larger whole.  So peer-to-peer training should feel natural.  An early draft of this talk was presented during the [MiniDebConf Online](https://peertube.debian.social/videos/watch/72d6d910-b8e3-4058-b4b5-d72a9883727f) in May 2020.
