Initiate trainings that perpetuate themselves.  Introducting a community-organizing method I have used, also anecdotes from other communities.  Similar to [each-one-teach-one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Each_one_teach_one) but faster, a [grassroots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots) method called [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_peer-to-peer_processes) education.  A small group can get things rolling and the larger community benefits.  

For Debian community, skills training might best include good governance processes, moderation, conflict resolution, meeting-efficiency or similar topics.  Debian already depends on overlapping group projects supporting a larger whole.  So peer-to-peer training should feel natural.  An early draft of this talk was presented during the [MiniDebConf Online](https://peertube.debian.social/videos/watch/72d6d910-b8e3-4058-b4b5-d72a9883727f) in May 2020.

	00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,680
so today i want to talk about

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,240
the possibility of debian perpetuating

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,640
its own

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,960
internal communications training

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,159
among its own membership and it doesn't

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,479
need to be just

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
debian internal it could be sistering

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,159
with

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,840
other you know outside free and open

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,840
source software communities

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,439
uh who are also dealing with online

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,799
communications and training each other

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,119
so it doesn't have to be just internal

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,880
to debian but i want it to be

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,960
debian folks to really have an

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,960
investment and be able to do it

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,479
and some of the examples that i'm

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,560
drawing from are from

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:46,240
community development of various sorts

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,360
just an anecdote i was looking for notes

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,360
on such a group that i had set up for a

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,960
co-housing community

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,960
back roughly 2005 or six and when i look

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,640
back at my notes this week i saw that i

00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,520
had told them that they should learn

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,399
from the software

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,799
developers about issue tracking and that

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,840
kind of thing

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,840
so that's those are my introductions

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,200
uh let's see here i want to talk about

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
i'm going to jump around a little bit

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,840
from my original

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,879
outline here i was also going to mention

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,040
that i was

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,959
available for the anti-harassment team

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,520
in taiwan

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,120
and that's just background just to let

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,400
you know that i have gotten involved

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,160
with a few issues and

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,760
and seen what's going on from the inside

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,360
in a number of ways plus i've been

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,120
paying attention to debian since 2003.

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,480
something that came up when i was

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,040
hearing

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,959
the sessions the last day or two is

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,840
when hearing about the communications

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,840
team

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,599
i am looking at irc nope they don't need

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,959
me

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,840
when thinking about the new

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,519
communications team which used to be the

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,040
anti-harassment team

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,360
i am seeing that that team

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,480
will need to become more formal and

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
meanwhile while

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,280
issues become while debian becomes more

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,760
important the issues become more central

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,800
stage

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,200
more legal issues become more crucial to

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,239
the

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,640
overall reputation and i'm going to see

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,319
that

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,560
i believe i'm going to see that

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,760
community's team get more and more

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,360
pushed towards a regulatory role and by

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,879
suggesting that there be more

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
peer-driven uh

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,159
communications training within debian

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,280
that's not

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,519
from a judicial in a decision-making

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,599
policy-setting group about what is and

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,640
is not okay

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,280
have most of that

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,360
nuts and bolts kind of work happening to

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,439
help prevent those issues

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
from coming up to that kind of level

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,159
where you end up needing something

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,200
equivalent to policy technical policy

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,959
decisions being made on the

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,959
communications policy end

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
because that will that is coming up that

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,640
is needed but

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,720
um the rank and file need to be able to

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,159
self-facilitate an example i have

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:18,400
for that is a story

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:21,440
uh from another community that i believe

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,360
uh developers should be aware of and

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,600
it's large and it has a lot of

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,120
literature and that's helpful

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,240
and that is the secular use of

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,280
quaker consensus

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,400
decision making models

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,720
so i'm calling it secular consensus

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,880
secular quaker because it's not from the

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,080
society of friends necessarily

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,400
and their spiritual communing that they

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,280
do

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:54,560
through you know egalitarian speaking

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,919
from inspiration this is more about

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,199
a nuts and bolts how to run

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,759
consensus meetings and do policy setting

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,080
and do

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,840
governance of important organizations

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,479
and large organizations through this

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,840
kind of formal consensus

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,400
it'll be called a number of different

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,639
things uh

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,560
meanwhile within that community there's

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,360
this idea called

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,280
uh facilitating from the back benches

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,639
and facilitating from the back benches

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,160
uh refers to someone or

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,320
who is not up front

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,320
uh doing something that in debian is

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,600
usually called moderating

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,840
it's not somebody moderating up front

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,199
it's one or more people in the audience

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,240
or from the circle who are asking

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,880
questions and making comments that in

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,840
fact

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,840
facilitate the group and

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,639
you know they didn't even need it

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,280
and what i had to tell them was no

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,080
you actually didn't do the facilitating

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,680
because

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,840
you weren't you know this is like a

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,560
trial run for the training

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,960
and i said actually they saw that you

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,800
weren't

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,080
doing the steps that needed to be done

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,880
so they were doing it from the back

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
benches

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,639
people were asking the questions making

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
the comments and making the suggestions

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,160
that everyone

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,080
kind of sort of knew were legitimate

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,319
things for a facilitator to say to keep

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,880
the

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,759
conversation going so this is the kind

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,800
of

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,199
math movement that i'm envisioning

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,599
that debian developers could help

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:58,000
engender within their own communities

00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:01,440
it won't be everybody um computer

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,199
technicians uh often

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,360
as a personality trait prefer the clear

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,440
straightforward or at least problem

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,400
solvable communications you get from a

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,840
computer

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,199
and do not appreciate the the thousands

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,479
of different factors that need to be

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,840
taken into account at once

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,840
when you're dealing with real people

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,840
it's dealing with real people is much

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,080
more complex than a computer

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,160
so there will be people who are good at

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,319
that and they're not always very

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,400
active in debian now and might be in the

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,919
future so what i'm talking about

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,120
is bringing those folks in debian who

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,400
are known for being better communicators

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,680
and respected

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,000
and appreciated and able to pass things

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,360
on

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,720
at least by example bringing them into

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,160
circles of learners

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,160
who are then passing that on

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,599
so here we go

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,479
so the concepts of facilitating from the

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,960
back benches

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,840
uh let's see i'm opening my

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,800
horrendously huge org mode file here my

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,800
apologies

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,000
okay so here are some examples that i've

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,879
written that you won't try to read i

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,919
hope

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:24,720
um of ways in which

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,960
a group can be made self-perpetuating

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,240
so for example uh so let's say you start

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,240
with a small group

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,599
it's an affinity group style meaning

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,039
that these are people who have some

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,440
affinity for each other

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,479
they can work with each other uh it's

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,240
voluntary

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,919
uh it doesn't have to be voluntary but

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,039
i'm picturing something that's voluntary

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,519
because that made

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,839
a lot of the hurdles easier to deal with

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,040
um

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,200
and for debbie and it wouldn't make

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,399
sense to be non-volunteer uh

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,000
actually wait a second back up voluntary

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,480
is important because

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,200
it allows the participants to support

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,040
the group

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,959
and know that each other are all trying

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,440
to be

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,000
helping each other if you force someone

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,080
to go through such a training

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
yes you can force their presence but you

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,880
can't force

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,680
their will to be nice and to help each

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,519
other learn

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,200
and get through this so in the easiest

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,080
ideal situation i'm suggesting everyone

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,880
be voluntary

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,519
uh people come in with if they're all

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
getting to

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,800
if it's rolling admission it might be

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
different but let's say you're all

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,680
starting it once

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,760
then you're going to do a one month once

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,160
a week so you're going to do a four

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,600
session training and you're all starting

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,680
the first week

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,480
so i'm suggesting people could come in

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,920
with their original stated concerns

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,120
or interests such as

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,440
i have harassment concerns or i have

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,080
moderating skill concerns

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,000
or i'm wondering what are best practices

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,040
in issue tracking communications that

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,160
kind of thing

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,360
so those interests are what guide that

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,440
participants study and also our

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,160
guide that participants future

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,800
contributions to the group

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,760
trainers uh may you might bring in an

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,519
outside trainer

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,000
i would suggest first starting with

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,000
people who are considered good at

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,519
uh communications training inside the

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,560
community

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,399
but the trainer's role is to set

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,040
up each to hear those participants

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,079
mention

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,160
their interests and their concerns and

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,760
point them to resources that they can

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,279
study on their own

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,360
so it's a little bit of mentoring or

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,120
tutoring to help those

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,120
folks follow their own goals

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,120
um also if everyone's starting at the

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,279
same time then that first session can

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,640
include scheduling future dates

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,800
so the idea here i'm getting really

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
specific but these things are very

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,640
flexible

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,279
the point i'm making here is that folks

00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
are coming in

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,560
introducing themselves to each other

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,839
saying this is who i am and what i'm

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,680
interested in

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:09,360
but uh it taking that

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,160
not as an audience or you know a

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,959
a receptive student's perspective but

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
take that from

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,920
okay this is an active participant that

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,360
you're trying to take advantage of and

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,320
make sure that their contribution helps

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,920
this thing along

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,240
find out what they're interested in and

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,800
get them you know get their wheels on

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,040
the road

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,480
to actually making traction getting

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,760
traction and actually

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,760
bringing back the results of their

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,160
research into the group so we can learn

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,160
from them

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,839
and then the those presentations that

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,720
they make later are just

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,519
small presentations maybe 10 minutes or

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,200
less

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,560
depending on the context and the size of

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,760
your training

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,600
but they're really just to get the

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,920
conversation rolling and to point people

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,839
towards resources that they've found

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,519
or maybe to get the group to talk about

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,240
topic questions that they have about

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,720
these things

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,160
uh another thing to consider in this

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,360
type of training

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,959
is that you have rotating roles that

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
people are actually dog fooding the

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,839
process

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
they're someone's doing time keeping

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,600
someone's doing note-taking someone's

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,040
actually the facilitator who has you

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,680
know somebody who's

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,839
best experience available is the con

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,959
facilitator a convener which is somebody

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,560
who actually

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,560
makes sure the venue is available

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,000
whatever that would mean if it was

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,920
online

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,519
so basically you're splitting up a

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,360
complex role

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,880
into subparts so people can get

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,079
experience with those small points

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,000
because believe me

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:41,200
having to combine time tracking uh

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,839
scribing note-taking and

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,120
calling on people and you know calling a

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,040
meeting to order those

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,720
takes a huge amount of your brain and

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,560
nervous system to do

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,519
so breaking those small things up so

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,920
that people can

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,920
practice

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,399
now what i have is some

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,920
content ideas and

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,920
let me see if i can find them okay here

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:22,240
i get a time check here okay i see it

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,959
so possible topics so let's pretend

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
again

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,040
you have a group of people who've

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,079
decided okay you know there's only

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,279
three to five of us but let's try this

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,120
and see if it works

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,880
okay here's a recommendation of how you

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,959
might start let's say you're going to

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,279
have four meetings

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,639
in your first session you're just going

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,000
to talk about big

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,839
big picture stuff why are we having the

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,720
training the importance what kind of

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,519
resources

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,480
are we going to use reading videos what

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,720
have you

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,480
uh scheduling future events and then

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,600
talk about some philosophy

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,160
some theory you know where is debian and

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,199
this stuff

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,040
why do we need it and that way

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,959
because this topic is so broad because

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,959
all these four topics are so broad

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,800
people with their individual concerns

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,639
can gear it towards what they're

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
interested in maybe it's anti-harassment

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,880
maybe

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,160
it's issue tracking forums that kind of

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,839
thing

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,560
second session concepts uh

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,360
vocabulary that kind of thing third

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,839
session

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,440
process this is gets more implemented

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,360
now we're talking about

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,880
how does debian make decisions how does

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,560
it make technical decisions

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,880
how does it make personnel membership uh

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,399
decisions um whether someone's a

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,680
developer or not or loses their

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,440
development status you know these are

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,639
kind of like nuts and bolts of how we

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
actually do things

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,320
but it's also should be about um

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,800
in the best of all possible worlds how

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,680
do we make decisions

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,800
when i did these kinds of trainings i

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,920
would usually focus

00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:00,880
on this ct butler's

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,519
on conflict and consensus handbook

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,600
written

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:08,480
in late 70s early 80s

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,199
and he was encoding some quake secular

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,920
quaker

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,959
process in terms of what he observed in

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,160
activist

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,000
groups at that time so it's a it's a

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,639
very cookbook style

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,839
book and i will promise to put a post of

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
that up somewhere

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,440
but what i would do is say okay this is

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,600
butler's

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,959
version of the flow chart that

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,759
shows you know first you get the agenda

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,440
set you have introductions you call for

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,440
concerns

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,199
what have you you know these are details

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,959
of that

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:49,519
on your fourth session techniques

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,480
and then get into more of the specifics

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,240
of okay now we know the overall process

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
uh what are things you do during

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,639
different parts of that process

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,079
so how do you call a group's attention

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,680
how do you deal with people who are

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,079
repeating themselves how do you keep

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,120
things

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,440
on topic how do you introduce topics how

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,639
it's like a how-to for the things you

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,600
talked about theoretically before

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,279
and then repeat that cycle perhaps you

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,199
have an outside trainer that's been a

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,199
consultant during this process and maybe

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,680
they'll stop after the four weeks maybe

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,560
they'll

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,279
can continue on maybe you have some

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,399
senior

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,279
uh folks who've got a lot of history and

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,959
devein

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,880
who promised to stick around for four

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,880
weeks but they're not going to go past

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,320
four weeks or maybe you know if you can

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,480
you'll have somebody continue for

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,040
another cycle so people can learn

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,800
how it is this cycle continues and if

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,560
you have rolling admission that people

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
people can keep coming in

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,639
i don't want to spend a lot more time

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,639
unless people ask me to later about

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,440
um

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,399
about those nuts and bolts i'd rather

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,240
talk about the overall idea

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,000
uh and i don't want people to get too

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,400
specific and say this is the way we have

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
to do it

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,319
heard someone mentioned the debian

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,600
academy idea

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,600
so here's something you could a proposal

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:18,000
you could put underneath that

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,839
concept that that general idea

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,039
so places in which this kind of thing

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,319
has worked

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,439
well vagrant

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,640
pointed out to me that that i

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,760
had forgotten that latin america

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,559
has a strong reputation for these kinds

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,679
of

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,640
uh literacy trainings getting huge

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,520
amounts of the

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,640
number of the population from illiterate

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,320
to book reading

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,320
in a small number of years

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,600
because you allow people who have got

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,960
some

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,919
uh measurable simply measurable amount

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,039
of competence

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,039
say your measure is um

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,640
this person has gone through the four

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,000
part the four session

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,440
cycle twice they're now

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,720
being empowered to set up their own

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,080
something as simple as that

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,640
can cause replication not

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,320
just self-perpetuation but replication

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,679
where you have it branching off

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,400
lots of branching in a way that

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,480
is not a fork necessarily meaning

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,760
completely different project but more of

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,880
a supportive rolling out

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,760
and delivery to a larger population

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,440
china did it quite successfully with

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,960
barefoot doctors

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,080
getting herbal training out after

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,240
uh decades of war and and

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,280
were able to successfully get many many

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,919
people um

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,840
the kind of first aid and health minimal

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,160
health training they needed

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,520
um the example that i was first made

00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,799
familiar with was in the 1970s

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,840
at a time when u.s and other european

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,520
style cultures had lost

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,840
intergenerational knowledge about

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,039
breastfeeding

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,600
so women were relying on medical doctors

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,760
telling them that formulas were safer

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,200
and when that scientific education

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,200
became clearly wrong

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,360
there was a large grassroots movement to

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,559
train

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,000
for women to train each other on how to

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,200
breastfeed and raise children in a

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,200
healthy manner

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,720
so an organization called lelache league

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,720
which i believe this french

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,280
just did something exactly like this

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,080
in four sessions you read a book

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,520
together

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,120
and you had topics that were as

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,720
equivalently broad as the ones i'm

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,320
describing here

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,919
and after you had gone through a certain

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,000
number of sessions

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,960
you might be empowered by the group to

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,080
have the next

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,760
a set of meetings at your house and

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,679
this was as far as i know

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:07,200
measurably connected to the

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,000
very fast re-uptake of breastfeeding as

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,480
a practice

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,159
in the united states i'm going to add

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,360
an example from 2018 when i led

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,840
an unrecorded

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,799
session uh hoping to bring folks

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,480
together that

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:29,600
had some trauma

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,600
around flame wars in demiu

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,159
and debian and and show a way of talking

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,280
about debian process that would

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,039
desensitize

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,039
folks from

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,600
that kind of pain so the goal

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,640
was to in the long term build a

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,720
tradition

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,720
where folks could come together and

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,720
share information about what works and

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,799
what they could still use help with

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:04,480
so what i did is with these goals

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,760
i gave two very very short slides

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,400
basically

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,240
i just said we're going to pass the

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,640
microphone around

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,679
and i would like you to finish one of

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,280
these statements

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,960
here are some ways in which you can tell

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,360
stories

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,720
and i gave them these four examples of

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,440
ways to start

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,880
a short story to tell the group and that

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,320
we would not have discussion

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:33,440
we would merely hear from each other

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,400
instead of telling a negative story

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,360
frame it in terms of possible ways to

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,159
ask for help

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,440
so for example something that could be

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,440
improved

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:49,120
is or we are not so good at

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,159
or our strengths have costs uh something

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,799
we could improve

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,960
is uh we don't understand how other

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,080
groups solve this type of problem

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,159
these are things that are not

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,559
necessarily criticizing oneself

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,679
but uh and opening up and looking for

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,440
advice

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:08,799
so at the end of this session

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:13,440
in 2018 taiwan

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:17,200
i found that

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,880
um folks were happy they felt they had

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,960
learned something people who had been in

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,159
the middle of some of those

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,159
uh conversations didn't hear about some

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,360
of the positive things that happened

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,080
in the out of the scenes

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,600
so while they were listening and reading

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,360
uh flame wars

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,240
uh there was other stuff going on that

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,039
they didn't hear about until this

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,000
session also another thing that happened

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,320
in this session

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,240
um and by the way did i mention that

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,919
there wasn't discussion until people had

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,960
told their short stories only at the end

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,080
we had discussion

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,240
but it was just a set of short uh little

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,760
vignettes that people told about

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,360
also folks that had been in the middle

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,440
of problems said

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:05,840
uh at least one person who had been

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,840
in a conflict told me that

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:13,360
they wouldn't have attended

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,679
or contributed to a session on that

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,480
topic if it had been recorded

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,760
meanwhile it went really well and i i

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,440
think it could be done again in the

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
future and record it and i think it

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,840
could go very

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,880
well um so that's all i had to

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,159
talk about today and

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:51,840
i'm well i always have more so let's do

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:51,840
conversation okay or contact me thanks

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:52,640
thank you daily for your talk and now

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:56,400
let's see some questions

00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:01,679
um why did you write some audio

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:05,120
is missing on your slide warning us

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,679
uh one of the slides said some audio is

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,039
missing

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,240
as a bullet point because i was not

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,880
doing editing

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,520
uh well enough to go and take that audio

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,120
silence out or fill it i just wanted to

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,520
let people know not to get

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,520
give up

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,600
and to realize that

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,400
the sound would return

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,679
okay so um

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:43,919
would you like to to add something else

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:48,400
yeah uh i really hope folks

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:52,159
will notice that

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,600
i've started a project

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:59,360
on sultan's git lab

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,919
where i believe my workflow

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,679
will best be served and allow others to

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,679
contribute in a way

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,440
that would work for me and that is

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,760
through a wiki

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,360
because this can be a very text-based

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,720
project that i'm inviting people to be

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,520
part of uh last time i gave a draft of

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,240
this talk

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,159
i heard many questions about okay what

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,600
do we do like how

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,760
what do you think is the way to

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,559
incorporate this into debian

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,200
and i believe a a really good way to

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,919
start

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,880
is to just ask people to contribute

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:39,200
ideas to what could become a manual

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:42,159
of how to do how to train people

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,880
about good communications so it might be

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,320
just

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,720
here's a communication piece of advice

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,120
but it could also then be organized in

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,320
terms of this is how you teach it

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,880
so i at the top of the etherpad page

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,440
i provided a link saying here's an intro

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,159
an invitation

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,600
and it's called at salsa debian.org it's

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,640
under my username

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,600
d-lib d-e-l-i-b and the name of the

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,880
project is just

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,799
generic communications training and

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,840
uh most of the and what i'm doing is

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:20,080
seeding it with pages that can describe

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,320
here's what it's expected on this wiki

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,640
here's some formatting ideas here are

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,760
sources we can work with

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,720
and just inviting people to create new

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,919
wiki pages

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,240
put ideas in there and then

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,520
i myself i feel that i'm good at

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,279
organizing text

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,440
and finding patterns in it and

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,120
contributing i like wikis because if i

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,360
make mistakes

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,200
i don't persevere and try to make it

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,200
perfect before i tell anybody you know

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,880
and try to keep it to myself before

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,520
until i'm ready for publication which

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,120
never happens instead i can just put out

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,799
there these you know ideas

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,799
in a way that wiki is really good for

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,840
thank you very much delib

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,480
thank you is that all the time we have

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,480
you is that all the time
