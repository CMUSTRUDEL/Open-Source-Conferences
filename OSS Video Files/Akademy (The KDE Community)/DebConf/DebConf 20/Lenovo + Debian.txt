I'd be happy to do a intro talk from Lenovo if that is of interest. Perhaps discussing and brainstorming on how Lenovo and Debian can collaborate more closely - I'd really love to get Lenovo contributing more actively to the Debian community.

I'm open to suggestions as to what could or should be covered - basically I'm happy to make myself available for questions and I'm happy to present a few slides if that would be of interest - showing some of the work Lenovo is doing in the open source world and explaining some of the details of our Linux project which has been growing rapidly.

There was a fairly recent mailing list thread about doing a Debian preload and some of the challenges that raises for both the Debian community and HW manufacturers like Lenovo which I think would be a topic folk would be interested in.
