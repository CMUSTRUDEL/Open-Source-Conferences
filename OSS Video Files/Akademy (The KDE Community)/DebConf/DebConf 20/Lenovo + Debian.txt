Title: Lenovo + Debian
Publication date: 2020-10-23

Description:

At: DebConf20
https://debconf20.debconf.org/talks/67-lenovo-debian/

I'd be happy to do a intro talk from Lenovo if that is of interest. Perhaps discussing and brainstorming on how Lenovo and Debian can collaborate more closely - I'd really love to get Lenovo contributing more actively to the Debian community.

I'm open to suggestions as to what could or should be covered - basically I'm happy to make myself available for questions and I'm happy to present a few slides if that would be of interest - showing some of the work Lenovo is doing in the open source world and explaining some of the details of our Linux project which has been growing rapidly.

There was a fairly recent mailing list thread about doing a Debian preload and some of the challenges that raises for both the Debian community and HW manufacturers like Lenovo which I think would be a topic folk would be interested in.

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
i'd like as much as possible for this to

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,479
like not to be doing too much talking

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,119
myself but

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,520
i realized because of the way it is um

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,600
that's

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,439
that's how it is um so but yeah

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,640
questions on ether pad be great if

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,600
anybody really wants to join in the

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,680
jitsi cool

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,119

and i'll send you the jitsi link i've

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,360
been told not to just post that um

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,159
underneath that

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,840
but yeah so as interactive as possible i

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,680
have some slides to go through

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,560
um i'm gonna kind of go through it

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
taking questions on the way and i might

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,520
just skip some of them if they

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,280
don't seem that interesting it's the

00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,600
main aim is to get questions from you

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,000
and

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,200
talk to you guys and get what you're

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,680
interested in

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,799
so on that note uh moving forward so

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,720
just like to introduce there's actually

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,479
two of us here so there's myself

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,480
um kind of got the introduction for i

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,319
joined the pc team uh just

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
almost a year ago exactly the beginning

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,800
of august um

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,640
and i've been discovering the joys of of

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
linux on pcs what's involved getting it

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,400
running

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,400
it's been crazy fun crazy busy um

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,640
so i'm the technical lead for the team

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,319
so it's my responsibility to

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,319
work out how we get limits going on the

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,080
lenovo platform uh our limits program

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,440
has been growing a lot and hopefully

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,560
continue to do so

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,000
and my colleague john trapasso's on here

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
john would you like to do an

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
introduction for yourself so i don't

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,879
mind it too much

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,319
sure so i'm the software product manager

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,599
for our workstation business unit here

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,599
at the nova

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,959
i work i drive a lot of our linux

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,200
strategy as well as

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,440
anything other else os and software

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,400
related

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,599
cool thanks john and yeah john's my

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,159
go-to guy he's

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,400
he's been around then he knows processes

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,360
and the people in lenovo sometimes don't

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
do that

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,959
um so just to give you an idea of topics

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
that we

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
can cover um and i'll do a little bit

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
based on how things are going

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,599
um i put some slides together that i

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,879
thought

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,480
might be interesting and again bit based

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,599
on time we'll see how it goes so

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,879
um jonathan mentioned in the uh dpl bits

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,080
of the linux portal for debian

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,599
developers so i was just going to give

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,400
you a little bit more information on

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,000
that one and

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,480
assuming people will be interested

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,159
what's actually involved there um

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,680
we've got web sales update big thing for

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,519
us has been our web sales so i'll just

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,599
give an update of where we are with that

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,720
um and then i've done a slide on some

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,400
specifics

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,480
from my experience with lenovo and

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
debian and then i was going to stop

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,360
there and see what the questions are

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
and and go through those um i do have

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
other slides

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
uh we've been working on releasing a

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,920
linux platform to the web so

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,599
i can i've got a slide just explaining

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,959
some of the process that happens there

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,480
some of the steps

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,720
what i've learned for it so i can cover

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,040
that uh i've got slide on some things

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,200
that lenovo sporting linux generally so

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
less debian specific but more more for

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,560
the linux community

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,239
a slide on a tool we've got think lmi

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,519
that we've just released publicly

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,079
and some kernel patches that we're

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,560
working on and that my aim really is

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,079
lots of questions and feedback um i will

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,800
keep an eye on etherpad as

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,720
things go on um and we'll see how it

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,479
goes and i know we've got a few people

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,600
uh who have been able to join the jitsu

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,880
forum so feel free to jump in if i ever

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,199
pause and then if you've got questions

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,720
just i can say does that sound all sound

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
good i'm not quite sure how i get the

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,280
feedback from this but

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,160
i'm gonna just keep okay

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,280
um so yeah jonathan mentioned the the

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,720
portal for dpl

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,360
and basically we're looking for a way to

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
to make it easier to get uh lenovo

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
hardware into

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,320
developer um hands so

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,600
there it's it's the urls to be announced

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,160
it should be very soon

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,000
the idea is that you log in with your

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,320
you have to have a debian.org address

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,880
the aim is to keep it only it's only for

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
debian developers it's uh you know it's

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,479
it's a

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,520
it's aimed at you guys uh and

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,199
there's a discount on lenovo products

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,039
um it's on all lenovo products it's not

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,000
tied to just our linux platform so if

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,840
you want to get

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
some of the platforms that we don't have

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
linux support on

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,800
because that's the hardware you want

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,199
that that's uh that's good

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,360
uh just as a note the screenshot is for

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,680
the employee site because i can't

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,440
log in because i don't have a debian

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,840
that'll address but jonathan did

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,800
test it out for us and we will have it

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,639
uh live

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,840
um fairly soon um so yeah we and

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,080
it will be initially just uh

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,000
it's gonna be us and i managed to get

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,639
canada and we are working on the other

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,919
geos

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,120
it just evgo has a different portal so

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,840
we have to work through those

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,319
um so that takes the time so the us one

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,800
is

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,560
almost ready to roll um or u.s and

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,639
canada i should say um but

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,919
and we are we are hoping and planning to

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,960
roll it out for other

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,479
geos as well just they're gonna be um

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,039
a bit behind uh john is there anything

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,840
i've

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,080
missed on that that you think we should

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,880
cover

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,919
no i think that was it thank you

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,120
alrighty so

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,440
just i'm going to quick scan if

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,680
anybody's got some questions on etherpad

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
okay

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,160
okay so there's a question if i'm buying

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,400
on lenovo online

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,759
how can i be sure that laptop will fully

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,759
work with debian

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,600
and that's a really good question and

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,880
honestly i think uh a lot of time the

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,039
answer will be

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,199
um it's it's hard to say so

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,039
i will come back to that in a bit

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,560
because i've got another slide

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,800
um that will cover it so

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,080
obviously if you get one of our linux

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,080
certified platforms

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,199
one of the big things we try and do is

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,720
make sure

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,479
well one of the things we do is make

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,919
sure all the fixes go upstream

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,800
so um you know kernel patches

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,240
go upstream and and all the other pieces

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,599
go out of stream so

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,680
really it should work in debian uh

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,199
my recommendation is quite often

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,160
especially with these new laptops is go

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,639
with testing

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,680
um and even then there are still some

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,960
hiccups and

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,199
we'll cover some of those in a little

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,759
bit um so yeah there's no

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,880
guarantees it will work with debian is

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,240
is the short answer

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,960
there are some things we are doing to

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,199
make that better and overall

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,840
um yeah it is our aim is to support

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,280
linux upstream so it should work for all

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,039
the distros

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,960
okay uh and uh yeah i'll cover lvfs as

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,360
well firmware updates no vfs that's

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,720
there

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,919
we'll we'll cover that too um

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,440
and as the other question is as and when

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,639
u.s sales available

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,080
how will you let us know um there should

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,560
be some media announcements i'm going to

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
give you

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,919
uh i'll give you a little bit more

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,520
information on the usl there will be

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,840
media announcements there

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,319
i will be posting on our forum if you

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,039
guys want i can stick a note in

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,319
the debian mailing list um guessing

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,599
debian devel

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,919
um so does that

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,240
cover it's uh yeah honestly we're still

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,919
scrambling a little bit so

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,199
my screen's over there which is why if

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,560
you're wondering i'm looking sideways

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,760
you get my profile uh

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,959
say uh egyptian

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,000
okay so yeah i will try i will i will

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,640
post a note to

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,880
debian develop that's a note to myself

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,880
here

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,640
actually i'll have a copy of these so

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,240
i'll do that okay

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,480
um and there was another question

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,600
uh so just so no people who pre-posted

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,640
questions i'm not going to ignore those

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
i will come back to them i'm just kind

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
of trying to

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
tag in with with where the questions

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,480
come up as we do the talk

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,760
there was any prospects of lenovo

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,120
shipping on arm

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,720
64 or arch 64 laptop with reasonable

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,080
specs

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,760
no no not not it's not on our roadmap

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,680
right now i've i've actually had

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,440
discussions with arm developers

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,839
about how we can support linux on arm

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,760
it's it's a hard sell um so

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,600
um so right now arm is not on our road

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,839
map i'm afraid there's uh

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,279
there's some tricky pieces in there but

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,640
so not yet

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,160
um it's uh it's a little bit

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,760
customer driven as well so

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,519
okay oh i see someone types up my

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,560
answers great

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,320
okay so i will roll

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,120
on uh so web sales update

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,880
um i don't know how interested the

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,040
debian community is but so

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,440
we do have um the x1 carbon 8

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,800
is going to be the first one uh it's

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,040
cleared all of the

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,480
hurdles it's just basically at the last

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,000
paperwork it's waiting on the web sales

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,920
team to enable it

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
the web sales team is probably very

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,200
frustrated with me asking lots of

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,920
questions about what's going on

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,120
um their web sales team has committed to

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,240
have it up before august 31st

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,480
so that's coming up really soon um

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,440
i checked with them just yesterday

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,519
morning and they

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,920
still believe they're going to meet the

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,880
state so i'm i'm i'm hopeful so

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,600
it should be august 30 38 when carbon 8

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,880
should be

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,160
up uh we then

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
have um

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,360
strange um anyway so we have uh

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
a few more platforms coming soon uh i've

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,720
listed them

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,160
there um so i should clarify x1

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,519
carbonate there'll be a fedora

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,120
and a ubuntu option uh p53 p1 gen2

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,880
there's a ford ubuntu option the others

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,360
are all going to have ubuntu option on

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,360
them but

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,519
essentially that the key point is they

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,640
are they have been linux certified we

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,200
test them with linux and we are

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,880
supporting them and and

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,560
that side of things and then there's a

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,399
number of platforms coming

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,760
later in the year as they become

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,800
available right we're still working on

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,760
the hardware enablement

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
testing um that side of things uh did i

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,279
have

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,040
one more i don't know uh so anyway i'll

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,720
just go back i should know my own slides

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,800
better

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,839
so um question on core boot sport i'm

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,279
not gonna answer that one right now

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,079
we'll come back to it i'm not ignoring

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,360
you

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:35,120
is there any questions specifically on

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,120
platforms that i can take

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:43,200
i got a i got a question sure is that

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,279
so is debian going to be

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,720
like can we imagine debbie and being a

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,760
os that will be pre-installed in the

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,360
future

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,040
or it's certainly not impossible um

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,639
you know what i'm going to answer that

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,880
one on the next slide because the next

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,720
slide i do have a lenovo and debian

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,079
um there are some challenges to be

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,519
honest with doing

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,519
debian um and getting it on and

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,720
that'd be nice to i'd love to discuss

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,519
those and get feedback

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,240
from people if we can't do it all in

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,920
this because

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,760
it's kind of hard to do the face to face

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
with the typing and questions there

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,279
i'm very open to set up a call with

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,839
questions and to understand it we are

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,360
i'll get to we are supporting debian we

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,800
want debian to work on our platforms we

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,880
are testing with debian and i will get

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,079
to that but as a preload

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,959
um there are more steps to that and it's

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,320
not it's

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:38,480
not easy to do a preload um uh

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,399
because of all sorts of things so um

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,160
i will tell you so on platforms can we

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,480
please have idea pads i would love to do

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,560
i be

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:50,720
dear pads um it's not on our roadmap yet

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,600
um it's yeah i i think it would be a

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
good one to add

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,040
there's quite a lot is uh we're seeing

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,000
we we've grown the portfolio a lot this

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,360
year um

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,200
we have full configuration um

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,959
on the workstations and mobile

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,399
workstations and we're doing most of the

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,519
thinkpads there's just a couple

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,519
that aren't on there so it's a little

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,440
bit case of as long as the linux program

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,800
is successful and goes well

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,000
and the team can grow um i hope we can

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,360
add those but no they are not on the

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,680
roadmap right now

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,639
we're quite a small team and and we're

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,320
pretty

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,360
full on right now so

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,240
uh honestly for the other thing i should

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,560
comment is

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,839
a lot of what lenovo does is very

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,760
customer focused it's

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,519
important for us to do what customers

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,720
are asking for

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,240
so keep letting me know and so

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,199
the more i the more i have details of

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,639
how popular linux on a platform is the

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,959
easier it is for me to

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,160
convince executives to spend the time

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,920
and money it's not cheap

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,079
doing this you know to support these so

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
uh if anybody has good ways of getting

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,839
me that data

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,839
i'm interested

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,360
and john chipping if i'm saying anything

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,320
silly or if you want to correct anything

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,760
to add anything i'm

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,440
coming for no you're on point

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,040
really the hard part for the preload is

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
is making the business case so

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,279
um any feedback you guys can give us in

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,639
terms of what platforms you would be

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,800
most interested in

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,000
how many users you expect that type of

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,600
anything like that

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,360
will only help increase the likelihood

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,160
of us being able to roll something out

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
yeah and and so for example i know i've

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,760
heard

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,040
from a lot of different um people in the

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,720
open source community uh amd is is

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,399
has been i've had lots of questions

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,839
about amd um

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
so it's kind of interesting to see the

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,720
arm one i have heard on but not to the

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,320
same extent as that as amd

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,360
um actually you know what i'm just just

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,880
because it's right there in front of me

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,199
i'm gonna answer the call boot one

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,399
uh no no cool boots not not on the

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,959
roadmap at all

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,040
uh just we don't one of the things that

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,279
we do do is the hardware

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,399
is exactly the same as what we ship for

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,680
windows um

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,519
it's no difference we don't have a

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,880
special linux model it's like all the

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,519
ones with linux certifying is

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,360
the windows model that means sometimes

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,720
uh and i have some questions above about

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,560
fingerprint readers that i will get to

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,160
but it does mean sometimes that

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,920
that is a headache on the plus side it

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,360
does mean hey we're getting limit

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,800
support from vendors for

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,560
the same hardware um so cool boot

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,000
we have our bios um and it's just yeah i

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,959
that one's that one's not the roadmap i

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,720
feel like i'm answering a lot of

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,560
questions no

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,560
such as life um

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
so

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,880
so for the arm one uh sorry somebody

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,000
added they've been a lenovo customer for

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,639
that tops and

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,240
the rc4 so actually we do have a really

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,560
that we have a few really nice

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,560
arm laptops and i'm trying to see

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,639
i was looking at it so we have some

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,519
which would be good candidates and and

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,079
so i have

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,399
genuinely looked into it and the work

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,800
the community are doing on there is is

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
is excellent so if i mean linux does

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,920
actually

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,120
run on it if you're willing to jump

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,839
through the usual hoops

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,040
of getting it working the problem is and

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,160
it goes back to

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,320
to a little bit demand is uh we need to

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,440
get approval and we need to get buy-in

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,279
from

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,880
you know from the firmware teams and the

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,199
hardware teams and the

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,320
products and marketing teams so that

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,399
they

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,480
they are not seeing the demand for it

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,040
and so one of the things i have to do

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,800
is make sure if there is a demand for it

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,360
uh we do it so i have

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,120
been talking to the arm people i'm

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,959
hoping to go and listen in at the

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,279
they've got the arm conference uh

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,880
developer conference coming up soon so

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,120
i know they've got a presentation there

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,880
with a lenovo

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,560
laptop and running arm on it if you're

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,759
interested in that if you're going uh

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,560
keep an eye out for that

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,519
so i totally agree on it being chicken

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,279
and egg it's

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,959
and and it's honestly it's one of the

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,720
challenges for

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,880
doing a debian preload for doing for

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,799
doing linux on laptops part of it is

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
proving that there is the demand

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,400
and um we have to be a little bit

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,439
careful to

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,000
to not do too much at once as well we'd

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,319
be we

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,600
we don't want to release bad quality

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,360
stuff it's you know

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,679
got our lenovo brand on it it has to

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,880
make sure it's up to a good standard

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,799
and that we're doing everything

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,440
correctly so there's lots of pieces in

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,160
there

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,559
i hope that helped answer the question

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,559
um

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,320
platform uh yeah

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,160
no he's not yet mo yes can i

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,120
share a road map oh that's a good

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,480
question um

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,080
i don't know if i can i'd like to

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,080
for the platforms coming out this year

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,840
let me find out if i can i will post

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
something on here tomorrow and see what

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,000
i'm allowed to i think i can probably

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,160
share what we've got

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,160
planned for this year's i obviously

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,840
can't share next year's platforms but

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,960
this year's yes um

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,240
so the question disappeared anyway that

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,240
was what i was answering

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,760
um there's a question is it possible to

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,320
get them without the intel

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,880
me uh that ties back into the question

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,960
of we also ship these with windows

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:32,240
so no not yet not yet

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:36,000
yeah on the road map

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,840
uh right there was a question about

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,480
lenovo servers uh lenovo servers support

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,080
red hat fedora and suse no debian or but

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,200
number two is mentioned anyway that is

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,480
very true

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,960
um so i

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
talk a little bit with the lenovo server

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,440
folk

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,960
but uh they are a completely separate

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,120
group they don't

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,240
they you know they they're not part of

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,160
what we do

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,120
um so i i have some ideas of

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,400
what they're up to but um i can't speak

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,240
for them i'm afraid so

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,840
i'm not able to answer any questions

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,840
about what they're doing

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,799
um can i give a contact

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,640
email address for service sales i'd be

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,200
interested in cold storage to use

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,200
servers

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,480
and computer servers with lots of ram

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,760
and big amd

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,440
80 core cpus right

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,679
uh john do you know that one does that

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,000
fall into your side of the camp in any

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,600
way

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,880
through workstations do you have any

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,080
links into the server for their

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,080
server house people

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,480
i don't have anything i can say i'll

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,480
stop my head um i think we'd need to

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,400
chase that down offline

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,400
yeah so i'm not sure who put that

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,799
question in can you send send me an

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,679
email

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,960
and we'll find find that name for you i

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,960
i don't have the top of my head either

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,120
alrighty uh so

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,520
uh hello from greece uh let me see is

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,720
this

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,360
yasu i did used to speak a little bit of

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,360
greek but

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,919
i i wrote that yeah

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,520
so how is it supposed to be pronounced

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,080
uh i mean i don't really speak that much

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,080
greek but like

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,640
okay um at the organization do you want

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,919
to ask the questions you're there

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,280
i shouldn't read your question ask the

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,679
question you're on you're on the phone

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,600
no no it's not my question

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,080
no it's not mine oh okay all right

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,080
california

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,880
this is getting weird um at the

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,799
organization i work for we use debian

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,440
and our workstations are lenovo laptops

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,640
awesome

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,760
on debian x17 and eight and thinkpads

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,360
l14

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,280
we are getting the latest colonel from

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,480
buster backports also the drivers

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,760
will ever debian stable will be on par

00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,600
drivers and firmware wise with the newer

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,679
lenovo hardware so i don't think that's

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,320
actually a question for me and i don't

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,400
know if we have

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,360
anybody on here who can answer it but if

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,880
you had the carbon x178 how did you find

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,919
audio

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,159
so um

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,520
i'm going to take a little break from

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,000
questions just going to use this one as

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,240
a segue

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,080
just to bring up a few of the debian

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,559
things and i will come back to them

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,120
because

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,960
this carbon x1 card seven actual x108

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,360
actually gets covered specifically

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,960
so um i didn't manage to organize this

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,240
one so they came up one by one

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,280
um but on the slides um i wanted to just

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,600
raise some of the things that we're

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,760
doing specifically with debian so uh

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,520
conference sponsorship obviously so

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,400
that's probably fed up and seeing the

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,400
lenovo

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,520
logo flyby and that's why you have to

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,760
put up with me being here

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,200
um but we we are sponsored conference

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,400
then i think we're we're covered for

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,240
next year's as well so

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,600
uh thank you for letting us sponsor your

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,000
conference and letting us be part of it

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,120
um

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,080
genuinely thank you very much um we've

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,840
organized developer

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,360
portals so um i won't talk about that

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,000
one but hopefully

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,200
that's uh you know it's part of us

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,720
trying to

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,039
contribute to the community and become

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,760
part of it um so that leads me into the

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,240
biggest one i

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,120
we you know we would love to contribute

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,240
actively

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,640
um i have made some baby steps

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,360
in there i think i have two kernel

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
patches

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,799
that actually made it through i think i

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,840
might have had two or three that

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,520
never made it so but

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,760
we would like to contribute one of the

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,520
things i think we can do

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,799
um and again i'd be interested in

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,440
feedback uh

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,559
is we know what the patches are that go

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,720
into making

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,400
x1 carbon 7x1 carbonate we know we know

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,600
the patches that are going upstream that

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,159
are needed for our platform

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,400
so one of the things i was hoping to do

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,120
is just try and get those pulled into

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,799
debian

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,240
sooner um so i i've had some

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,679
conversations with ben

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,400
uh it's not the easiest process

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,280
a lot of that is honestly down to our

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,559
inexperience

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,400
as well um but

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,080
you know i i think that's one of the

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,559
more useful ways we can

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,159
contribute is by identifying where fixes

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,600
are upstream that we can bring into

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,360
debian if there i would be very open to

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,559
other ideas of how to contribute

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,280
actively you know uh in a developer

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,960
scope uh we we do have a small team of

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,000
technical people and we would like to be

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,679
involved so

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,360
keep that one in your ear you know in

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,080
your mind if you sit there and go you

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,440
know what

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,200
it'd be actually good if lenovo were

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,280
directly involved rather than just

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,039
you know then please let me know any

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,280
ideas um

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,280
i know i i put a thank you to paul wise

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,039
because he's sent me a brilliant list of

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,400
things that we can and should do

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,880
um and so i i have received ideas

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,760
from people in the community um but yeah

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,000
this is

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,440
kind of more on a technical how can we

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,640
make our platforms and debian work

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,360
better

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,159
interesting than that um so we do

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,600
actually test

00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,080
debian uh internally by our lenovo qa um

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,960
we don't do it on all of the platforms

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,200
just to

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
sort of highlight that uh we have tested

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,960
on the x1 carbon

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,159
8 we have tested it on the p1 gen 2 and

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,600
3.

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,679
um and i you know how much

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,120
that program expands i don't know but

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,960
part of the aim is we chose

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,880
two of our more popular platforms and to

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,960
try and get an idea of what

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,799
issues there are with debian i will say

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,000
it's been a fun exercise the

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,400
q18 started off by uh grabbing you know

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,679
the

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,440
10.5 and putting it on and and

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,960
a bunch of stuff doesn't work because

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,799
yeah and so you know then you have to

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,720
say explain that go grab testing and the

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,799
latest kernel and then things get

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,799
better um there are still issues um

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,159
one of the biggest ones and specifically

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,760
for the person who mentioned they use

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,360
the x1 carbon 78 is

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,840
the sof audio support from intel uh

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,679
has not been in debian the firmware the

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,520
topology files are still missing

00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,159
so we have um donated a system

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,520
uh maximilian said i could put his name

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,400
on here so hopefully he's all right with

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,480
that but anyway he

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,400
he's got next one calm night and he's

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,039
been working on ai he's done a bunch of

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,559
uh

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,400
a bunch of firmware has been pushed

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,360
upstream that improves uh some of the

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,120
networking in the

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,520
bluetooth already i was having a look at

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,720
those and he is working on the sof

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,480
uh audio support which i'm personally

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,760
really excited about because it's been

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,799
one of my frustrations

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,840
that i i've been trying to work debian

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,799
and intel to

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,279
get this sof firmware in and i just

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,760
didn't

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,279
have the right ways of doing it uh and

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
and i appreciate it's not necessarily

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,520
the most

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,000
fun job to do but uh so having i think

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,000
once that sof audio portion is is we

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
should get to a stage where

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,600
debian's going to run out of the box on

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,880
these platforms much better so i'm

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,159
genuinely excited by that and if

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,840
the same is useful going forwards we can

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,039
continue to follow that model if you

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,880
know if it's a case of

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,320
we need to you know if we need to get

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,279
some hardware into a

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,240
debian developer's hands to do that then

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,919
that is

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,679
i was successful with this one and it's

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,480
something i'm happy to

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,000
continue on um new hardware isn't always

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,799
the easiest thing to get a hold of but

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,080
um it's a possibility and i'd like to

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,919
again bring that back into

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,760
i'd like it so lenovo are actively

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,679
contributing as well i it's

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,360
it's good to hand out the hardware and

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,640
get every then that way but i would like

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,799
us to also be involved

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,559
too um and just before i go back to

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,760
questions i do want to just give a shout

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,760
out so that i

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,440
i i know i haven't got everybody but

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,320
there's a few people who have gone out

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,200
of their way to

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,600
help me and answer questions and just

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,240
point

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,840
me in the right direction so um hector

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,159
hector martinez has

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,679
been fantastic he you know he's handled

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,960
a lot of our questions and helped us out

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,960
with a bunch of things

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,480
he's genuinely been he he's been my

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,080
go-to guy um

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,360
paul wise again he sent me lots of

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,720
information and suggestions or things to

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,640
do uh rafael

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,960
and jonathan again just thank you for

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,120
the time really appreciate

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,080
when you when you to the community and

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,919
uh you know

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,400
it's it's it's a it's a learning curve

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,720
so yeah

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
so i think i'll jump back to the

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,520
questions we can

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,960
you we'll go back to slides if the

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,159
questions die down i'm not not sure if

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,480
that's going to happen john have you

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,080
been

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,440
able to look and follow them and seen

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,200
any to pick out in particular or

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,720
no for some reason the the questions

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
aren't showing up for me in my window i

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,720
don't know why

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,279
oh let let me just stick it in um

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,399
so i'll send it to you just you're on

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,679
the uh

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,440
the etherpad thing they're not they're

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,799
not updating

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,120
i don't actually have the etherbed link

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,399
sorry well that's my bad all right let

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,919
me send you that that will help a lot

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,600
and then you can jump in and

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,000
take questions while we feel that uh

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,559
where have you gone so yeah etherpad

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,559
the etherpad link is on the talk page

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,159
yeah i think i just sent john

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,840
unfortunately have you got it

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,919
yeah i've got it yeah it's coming up

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,760
right now oh awesome well done

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,279
alrighty um i'm just going to take a

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,000
couple of from the top just because i

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,080
didn't want to ignore

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,679
them um and these were people who put

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,880
their questions in nice and early

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,200
um there was a question from razer uh

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,200
how to send patches to fix acpi tables

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,480
in bios so short answer is send them

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,520
you know bug me or come to our

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,960
forums uh which i'll get to i did look

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,760
at that particular case

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,080
that's for an old laptop and one that is

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,399
not

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,279
unfortunately i don't believe linux

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,720
supported

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,240
so um i will caveat this so we go out of

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,919
we we really really try

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,840
to support linux on all of our platforms

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,039
but the levers that i can pull on to get

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,159
stuff done

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,880
are a lot lot smaller for platforms that

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,760
are not

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,480
on our linux certified list i just for

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,279
stuff

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,720
to get a bios team to make changes

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,880
bearing in mind that

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,080
they can't impact windows windows is

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,840
still

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,760
still our main you know still the main

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,320
os at lenovo let's be realistic about

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,000
that

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:05,200
so um bios changes are the hardest

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,360
to get done just that's the way life is

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,399
um but obviously if we have things that

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,000
are broken

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,919
if it's a linux certified platform i

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,240
have levers to put on to get that fixed

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,120
uh

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,399
if it's not a linux certified platform

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,120
then

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,039
we we can talk to the bio team i just

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,159
can't guarantee they will accept

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,799
to do it it's really case by case so

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,039
but yeah so the intent of the question

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,520
if you find issues

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,240
come come talk come talk to me or um and

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,480
and

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,919
lenovo forms are actually pretty good

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,720
your i mean my team

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,159
monitor them um but you get i mean the

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,760
great thing with open source community

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,360
right there's lots of really there's

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,559
smart people out there um who will

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,799
throw in extra information

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:55,679
all righty uh so we kind of talked about

00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:59,520
servers so i won't answer that question

00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:01,039
so okay um

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,559
quite a long question so i will

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,320
summarize it a little bit but

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,520
some lenovo laptops are sold with a

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,960
suggestion they will be supported by

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,039
ubuntu affordable

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,240
however not all hardware is supported by

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,880
linux by all

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,279
advertised models and they give the

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,120
example of the synaptics

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,279
touch fingerprint reader which is

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,120
lacking support in live f print

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,559
and there's some hacks to get around it

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,000
um on t480

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:29,600
so yes that is absolutely true

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,399
um the other one that comes up a lot is

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,039
w1

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,919
so the synapse so the fingerprint reader

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,120
we

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,120
we are reliant on hardware vendors um so

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,080
we worked with synaptics the fingerprint

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,159
reader does

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,080
work on a number of last year's

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,760
platforms x1 carbon it will work on the

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,159
p1 it will work on

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,600
p53 um i don't remember the more of some

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,360
head it will work on a number of

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,960
last year's platforms it is on

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,840
now i have to be careful because i told

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,200
it was on all of this year's platforms

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,440
but there is an l14 which

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,720
doesn't have it uh which was a little

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,200
bit irritated about

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,000
but the vast majority of this year's

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,000
platforms

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,320
have got that reader which has linux

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,600
support and the fingerprint team

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,919
were reminded of how important it was to

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,320
make sure they continued having

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,279
linux support on their platforms so the

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
fingerprint reader is

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,559
it's an example of where we are working

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,279
with the hardware vendors and making

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,279
sure that

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,440
got done it was kind of interesting and

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,039
like the firmware for it is on lvfs if

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,200
you have one of these platforms

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,320
which does have the supported reader uh

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,440
i think it's the 9d

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,120
one then uh lvfs update and make sure

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,519
you've got uh the

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,880
the the latest lib f trend and f and d

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,159
installed and it should work

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,760
um but so the problem with the

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,720
ones that it doesn't is the vendor

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,240
doesn't want to support it i think

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,000
they're match on host device

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,080
uh and the vendor is worried about

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,039
intellectual ip and we have not been

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,919
able to convince them to

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,200
support it uh and unfortunately lenovo

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,679
can't really

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,880
support some of the hacks that get

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,480
around it

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,000
it's just not really fair to our vendors

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,080
either so um

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,320
yeah that summarizes that um and

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,600
so you know the other point i want to

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,880
take more from this question is we work

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,039
really hard to support

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,120
all of the hardware on the platform

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,240
there are a few other cases w1 is the

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,200
main one that comes up

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,240
uh w1 support in linux is it's kind of

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,799
hard because of fcc regulations

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,519
we are working on it and we are hoping

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,919
to

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,840
have a solution uh later in the year for

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,120
the x1 carbon eight

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,880
and this one yoga five um it's but it's

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,880
again it's not easy there are

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,080
regulations in place and

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,679
open source makes that uh harder

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,679
technical challenge to

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,120
solve i i know there's some w1 people

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,840
out there who will call me out on that

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,480
but anyway from lenovo's point of view

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,399
um

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,480
streak one but we are working on that

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,120
other than that um

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,240
raid um comes up just because intel

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,559
doesn't have you know

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,399
made worse but not the the intel made

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,200
because it's not open sourced

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,399
um and then we get into kind of funny

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,840
pieces like the nfc

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,760
reader it works but you have to jump

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,679
through some hoops to make it work

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,440
sometimes ir camera comes up is not

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,919
supported that's getting better as well

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,600
so

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,200
all of these things we are working as a

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,240
team we're kind of aware of them

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,360
um and yeah it's not

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,840
perfect but we trying really hard to

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,720
make it better and and like for the

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,080
fingerprint reader

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,519
all our limited certified platforms

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,880
should be uh i supposed to be getting

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,000
the next supported

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,559
uh piece going back in time is is

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,200
harder john do you want to add anything

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,200
to

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:45,360
that one from your experience

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,640
no i think that that more or less covers

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,000
it it's

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:54,799
it's primarily a legal legal piece

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,679
the fcc regulations okay um

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,960
so what is expected that lvfs updates

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,600
from lenovo would stop

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,480
erasing grub from uefi and allow

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,480
seamless

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,679
fw update upgrade without needing

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,600
festival installer

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,119
so that one's slightly curious to me

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,240
because um

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:16,320
we support lvfs updates our firmware

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:21,359
is up on lvfs i talked to richard hughes

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:24,960
the lvfs maintainer quite a bit um

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,280
and yeah again it's not perfect there

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,919
are some devices where the vendor

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,679
doesn't have lvfs update support

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,040
available yet i know there's an ssd

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,960
drive that doesn't

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,560
um and w12 but it's uh

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,639
we are pushing all our hardware vendors

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,960
to support it all of our bios is

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,679
firmware system firmware updates

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,800
thunderbolt

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,520
updates are on lvfs and

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,960
i haven't seen an issue with having to

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,320
rescue gruff so

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,000
i might have to take that one offline

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,320
with some specifics um

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
but at least going forwards it should

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,880
work and i think lvfs is

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,760
important and if for some reason you do

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,000
see that problem

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,000
do by all means open a support ticket

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,440
and they will route it to mark's team so

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,440
that they can dig in and

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,599
figure out what exactly it is that went

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,640
wrong and how we can fix it

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,280
so there was the question there's a

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,119
question immediately below that

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,480
um will debian be oh so yeah it had two

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,400
pieces to this question so

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,240
will debian be at any time a target for

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,000
test and verification with a lenovo

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,480
linux certified laptop so i covered that

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
a bit

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,839
some some do uh honestly and and please

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,960
don't take this a long way but debian's

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,280
kind of one of the harder ones to you

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,480
know a harder distro to work with in the

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,000
you know response and and i think

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,079
because we're new we need to build

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,920
up the relationship so that we can we

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,000
can address these things quicker that's

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,839
one of the key aims one here kind of

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,320
it'd be nice to get a bit more two-way

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,440
but

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,320
um yeah we want to we want to do more

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,119
um we need to find ways to make the

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,079
debian

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,200
experience of getting support in easier

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,720
quicker and

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,960
all the less so we've talked about that

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,839
before um they then had that the

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,760
follow-on to this

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,839
question was that the laptop will not

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,200
break on updates by lvfs or any ufi

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,920
setting and they pointed to quite a long

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,079
thread

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,560
on our forums about thunderbolt support

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,920
and it breaking it on a p52

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,599
so i checked out the thread

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,240
it was before i joined the team so lvfs

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,119
has been a learning curve for our

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,440
firmware teams and

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,960
i know we've had mistakes along the way

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,560
we do test no updates

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,320
um did you did you sound like you want

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,920
to jump in john i

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,400
think if i'm remembering that issue

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,640
correctly i think it was actually

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,680
a fundamental thunderbolt issue on intel

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,720
side um

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,839
okay that it wasn't so much the

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,880
the lvfs firmware for it specifically it

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,839
was just that

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,599
there was something wrong in the

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,680
firmware that there were even problems

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,079
on the windows side

00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,000
okay fair enough yeah it was quite a

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,599
long long thread on the forum so i have

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,079
to admit i didn't get through it it was

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,920
15 pages worth um so

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,920
um i didn't

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,480
um i'm just gonna pause is there anybody

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,119
on the jitsi

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,240
uh who who did get a link who wanted to

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,480
ask a question i should give

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,520
just give a chance and i'm just seeing

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,480
uh if

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,839
anybody else so um i didn't have any

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,960
other requests

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,960
anything on there were we good

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,440
okay um

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,400
so lily so

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,040
i don't know if i want to read there's a

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,040
long comment about positivo

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,520
uh manufacturer of computers in brazil i

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,720
think this is more feedback so

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,240
um they have a policy

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,359
that the computer can run both some

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,560
version of microsoft and some

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,160
distribution of new

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,640
of new linux um

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,160
so that it and it and it permeates

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,400
backwards through their supply chains

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,599
and designs if lenovo did the same

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,280
then their suppliers would see the

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,000
necessity of making sure devices were

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,000
able to be supported

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,920
in the lens kernel and distributors and

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,359
customers customers who want

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,280
new linux on their systems feel more

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,720
confident of support so

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,240
absolutely 100 agree with that um yes

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,640
and that's where we're aiming for so

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,480
as part of our you know when we're

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,119
designing a new platform linux is a part

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,280
of that

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,960
the hardware vendors need to make sure

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,920
that their devices are supported on

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,440
linux

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,040
um and yes so we we're not the i guess

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,119
the the important caveat there is it's

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,839
not across the entire lenovo product

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,720
line

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:43,680
um and i yeah i i hope it does

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,040
permeate anyway i you know i think

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,240
hardware vendors are getting how

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,280
important linux is

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,560
it's seeing increased linux usage demand

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,880
that's why lenovo's doing it we're

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,960
seeing

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,480
increased linux demand i mean lenovo's

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,599
not

00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,320
not going to do it otherwise so i i

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,000
hope that that does see um overall linux

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,800
support from hardware vendors

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,119
increase uh improving uh i'm seeing it

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,720
for

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,160
for the devices we use um i'd be

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,359
intrigued to see if that's

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,920
true uh you know across across the

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,640
industry

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,839
uh but yeah now i i i'm hoping lenovo

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,760
are going to help drive

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,040
that um i know when i talk to hardware

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,839
vendors that i'm

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,720
you know make sure that's uh that's the

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,640
case

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,160
um so

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,320
hopefully i've covered that one oh hey

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,960
jonathan hello

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,440
how are you doing uh good i'm very

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,800
impressed by your skills by managing the

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:42,640
slides in the jitsi

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,320
because most most debian developers

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,839
aren't quite on that level when it comes

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,960
to so well it's kind of funny i have a

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,240
whole bunch of other slides i don't

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,040
think we're going to get to them and i

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,880
think i can just

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,320
share these slides so you guys can look

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,359
through them i you know i'm going to do

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,440
a really quick

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,640
whip through just we've only got five

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,000
minutes left on the call i don't know

00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,480
how it works we're getting shut down or

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,599
not

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,079
okay i'll go through them just just so

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,520
you guys

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,359
see them and if there's if they trigger

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,880
any questions so um

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,480
i kind of did a little bit of a

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,240
walkthrough of what was involved

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,480
releasing a lens platform

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,240
this was based on on the fedora project

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,000
experience which i figure is

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,839
not a million miles away from you guys i

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,599
i know that engineers

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,960
uh that make that life a little bit

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,720
easier but just so you guys know what's

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,160
involved with releasing a

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,160
platform so um particular case february

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,680
project kickoff got together decided

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,200
that actually it was going to happen and

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,599
get everybody all the stakeholders to

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,319
agree

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,800
so um did that and then february to

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,720
april

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,160
we have the you know the the initial

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,560
image testing bug fixing

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,240
cursing nouveau driver nvidia driver you

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,640
know all the usual stuff

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,280
um fixing the issues and getting it to

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,160
stage where

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,119
we're comfortable with it uh and then so

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,319
we had our ga

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,000
image in may uh and at that point we

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,760
take the ga image and it goes back to pa

00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,880
and it goes to a final testing pass just

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,319
to make sure there's no

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,079
you know critical high important fixes

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,359
uh we have to do energy certification

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,880
this has been

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,200
a new thing for me um energy

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,440
certification is so much fun

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,640
um we have to make sure we hit worldwide

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,720
standards uh

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,079
it's going to be really good i think uh

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,079
i'm expecting i

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,440
i have contributed patch up to systemd i

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,880
think this is going to help improve

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,800
linux you know it should

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,560
have some effects on making linux energy

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,560
usage better but

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,599
it's a challenge uh some platforms fly

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,160
through uh

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,839
and some platforms not so much so uh

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,280
energy certification is is

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:38,800
is always fun product documentation

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,400
um we have a linux user guide and

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,240
it needs to be written and it needs to

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,920
be checked and all that stuff so

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,440
that takes time um one of the big things

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,160
and i think this will benefit

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,000
debian users too but uh previously if

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,119
you called lenovo and said i have a

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,720
problem with my x1

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,240
carbon uh you know i'm running linux and

00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,599
this is not happening they would say we

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,960
don't support it and store windows go

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,440
away

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,800
they shouldn't do that anymore um so

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,400
i've done a bunch of training with our

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,079
support team so you should now be able

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,240
to say hey i'm using linux now

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,760
when you say you're using debian you

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,880
might still get some pushback so

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,960
just pretend you're running something

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,960
different but you should they

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,400
well what's up what's likely to happen

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,680
honestly is they should accept the call

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,319
and it will get escalated to my team

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,000
eventually

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,680
so don't do too many calls

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,280
women doubt the magic words are

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,079
escalating yes

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,079
yeah yeah so but we we genuinely we

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,640
transport linux we try not to be

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,480
focused on a distro obviously we have

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,560
the ones that we work with but uh we try

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,640
and support the next uh

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,760
and and then the bit the for me was a

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,760
real good so there's all these

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,440
configuration rules a configurator

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,160
configuration yeah configuration focused

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,760
a lot um

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,839
there's a whole bunch of launch

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,359
logistics that happens

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,400
when you actually want to get a system

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,599
up on the web so it's kind of funny

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,160
july's presence is kind of sitting there

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,480
going

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,440
wow but that's the bit we're in at the

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,640
moment there's

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,640
just process especially the first time

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,720
and um you know people saying going

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,680
what's the next so yeah august web sales

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,000
launches

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,119
august 31st uh i'm hoping i never have

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,079
to update the slide deck to say

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,520
september but

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,920
yeah so that's a quick overview of that

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,520
um i'm not gonna i'm just gonna wait

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,200
through the next two i will whip through

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,839
these these are not actually my slides

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,920
these are

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,880
my previous bosses but we use this

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,880
talking to customers

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,079
just to kind of give them an idea of

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,760
what we're doing for linux

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,599
and it's there suck it out

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,000
i mean most of it i think we've talked

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:37,040
about there's lvfs which is important

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,599
uh we've done some doc stuff

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,560
so anyway i'll get a bit more detail but

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,680
it's kind of like the

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,960
the pretty pretty picture i'm not

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,160
capable of writing slides like this

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,839
somebody else has to do this

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,000
beyond my art skills and and i'm not

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,760
sure holding hands is good

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,400
um and this is very much the same

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,119
um similar i'll just leave it up for a

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,240
few seconds

00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,640
to so you can sit there and go okay

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,960
but uh yeah there's lots we do i'm gonna

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,560
highlight working with the ihvs

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,480
uh that's the hardware vendors it took

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,720
me a while to figure out what that was

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,319
um and an lvfs firmware update so

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,760
uh let's look at that it's time to use

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:18,880
my voice um

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,359
so somebody asked about um anyway

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,079
there's there is our linux forum we have

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,560
us

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,119
uh you know we have a linux forum a lot

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,440
of stuff

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,520
ends up in the uh so you know we have a

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,599
fedora red hat ubuntu section

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,119
uh potentially we can add a debian

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,920
section that would not be a difficult

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,000
thing to do if we

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,599
start seeing lots of debian questions or

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,680
maybe if it's something

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,680
you know i think having a debian section

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,160
good i'm i'm open to that uh at the

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,280
moment

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,119
we don't have one um but yeah we get

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,640
quite a lot of questions on that it's uh

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,160
one of the things i

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,000
struggle a little bit to keep up with it

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,599
but there's always lots of

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,520
interesting discussions and it's it's a

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,000
good place to start my team do

00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,280
do monitor it um i wanted to mention

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,119
just some of the work we're doing with

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,200
the open source community community so

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,839
we have you know we've been

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,119
patches upstream uh working with audio

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,240
people on audio issues

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,280
gnome systemd thermal demon uh i

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,560
i'm surprised there hasn't been a

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,079
thermal question in the link maybe i've

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,440
not found it yet um

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,400
but yeah usually there's a thermal

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,680
question i'd love thermal questions

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,160
graphics graphics is always fun too um i

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,680
do

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,280
just you know i i do uh i am on the

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,040
debian project david colonel daddy and

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,880
devel main list i'll be honest

00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,640
i filter them if the word lenovo shows

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,160
up because

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,000
there's a lot of stuff on there i read i

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,119
do read stuff i know jonathan when

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,040
you know when there were the recent

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,160
elections i i read through those i do

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,800
try and

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,319
go in there and pick on subjects that

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,079
look interesting you guys have a very

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,640
active community it's fantastic keep it

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,640
up

00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:54,079
um but i do you know i'm on there um

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,079
so if uh

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,000
was there a question uh no um you're

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,040
gonna wrap up

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,560
yeah we uh yeah ah okay

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,839
last one um there is a lvfs uh

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,880
first questions okay oh now also still

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:14,160
another 30 seconds of a time

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,319
i'm sorry yeah and i will

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,280
yeah go for it this question is about

00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,599
the u.s launch

00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,200
and how soon we can expect to launch

00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,880
outside of the us for the

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,640
uh for the end developers being able to

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,400
buy hardware is that something you can

00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,200
answer now or should we wait for the

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,440
announcement

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,319
okay uh no so i don't know is the short

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,680
answer so actually

00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,960
john john you had a good answer for this

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,520
can i put you on the spot for the out of

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,599
the u.s

00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,560
uh things because i know you've filtered

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,880
this question

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,800
it completely and totally depends on

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,400
each geo it's it's not something we have

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,400
any direct control over

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,079
um but i i would say that it's

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,720
reasonable that within about two weeks

00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,319
or so

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,160
we should have an idea of what the

00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,359
schedules look like and be able to share

00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,640
something

00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:57,760
so yeah we'll we'll push um

00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,280
but yeah i still don't know the pricing

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,640
on these linux laptops if there's any

00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,920
consolation i'm just sitting there

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,720
because the other question i usually get

00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,680
is like what's the price going to be

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,319
i can tell you what i've got well you

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,599
don't you don't

00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:13,440
you don't have the linux price price

00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,200
okay what the one other thing i was

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,640
going to mention on on the

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,960
um the portal is just because you don't

00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,920
see

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,000
something as an off option on the web

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,040
does not necessarily mean it's not an

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,480
option

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,559
there's a number that'll pop up on the

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,640
side there and if you call that it'll

00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,160
drop you into the inbound sales team

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,000
and they actually have access to a

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,720
different configurator that can

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,200
frequently

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,800
configure hardware selections that you

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,760
might not actually have access to on the

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,480
web link

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,520
so this is especially a big point for

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,680
for those folks in

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,359
in different geos where they're they

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,640
make not offer a specific product on the

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,319
web

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,079
in some cases they might actually have

00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:55,200
it available through that

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,359
route so

00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,720
so yeah if you're at a time john i'm

00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,559
going to use an example but if you're in

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,200
south africa and you want your x1 carbon

00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,359
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,559
you could if even if it's not showing up

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,240
on a web page with linux

00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,000
uh even if not show the page you can

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,920
phone and they should

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,160
do it for you i don't know how that will

00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,079
work with the uh portal as well

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,200
that would enjoy and i don't i jonathan

00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,160
i don't know when you join but the

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,160
portal the important point

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,200
at the moment it's only enabled for us

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,800
and canada so we are working on rolling

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,240
that out worldwide too i don't have the

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,599
dates for that either so we've got to go

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,960
through every geo and

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,640
get them to do it so we are we are

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,599
working on that

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,119
um i'm happy to stay and ask questions

00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,119
but obviously i'm sure people have

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:39,920
lives to get to uh i

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,119
let me know what works from your debian

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,240
recording

00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,160
point of view if you have to keep me out

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,559
that's cool too probably uh need to wrap

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,920
up

00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,559
uh actually we should probably wrap up

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,920
right now or a bit over um

00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:54,079
okay sorry it's fine um

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,200
thank you uh you know thank you for uh

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,119
future is looking pretty bright for

00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,480
lenovo and debian i

00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,319
i really appreciate it it was a very

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,000
interesting talk and

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,240
i'm definitely definitely gonna be

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,160
considering using a lenovo now so

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,839
well that's that that's fantastic and

00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,440
but honestly my main aim for this is yes

00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,280
obviously lenovo doing linux

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,359
that's the key point number one and i

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,559
genuinely feedback from the community of

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,040
ways we can

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,480
do things with you get involved make

00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,400
this uh

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,680
that that's that's really what i mean

00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,800
the the best stuff

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,040
i think it's good to share how we're

00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,040
doing that's right and one last point

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,559
cause i say this to everybody

00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,800
let me know if we're doing anything

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,480
wrong as well that's important to me i

00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,200
want to make sure lenovo's doing linux

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,640
right

00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,480
i think that's important to communities

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,599
like this i actually bruce perrin's talk

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,280
was really interesting

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,640
uh i think we're doing all the right

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,640
things um

00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:47,920
but yeah let me know i i good and bad

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,920
and i'll stop talking

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,440
thanks a lot thank you everybody have a

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:59,040
good

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:59,040
