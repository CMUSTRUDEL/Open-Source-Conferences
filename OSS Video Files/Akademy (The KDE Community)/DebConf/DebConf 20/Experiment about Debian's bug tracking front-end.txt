### An experiment about personalized front-end of bugs.debian.org

Debian has a bug tracking system and bugs.debian.org is a key infrastructure for Debian project.
It tracks many reports and the bug number is assigned to each reports.
You can view such a report via https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=NNNNNN.

This bug tracking mechanism is working well for a long time.
It is very cool but it may be not friendly for newcomers.

#### Target audience

* Debian contributor or maintainer who want to fix bugs not only the bugs which
is related to maintained packages by you

It may not interesting for Debian developer because DD is already familiar with bugs.debian.org, udd.debian.org, or qa.debian.org.

#### What will talk about

In this session, Iâ€™ll talk about one experiment about Debian's bug tracking mechanism.
It is constructed on traditional E-mail archives and simple front-end for it.

hi

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,599
thank you for coming to this session i

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,440
start a presentation

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,840
and experiment about personalized

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,320
frontline book by debian r

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,760
this file was already patterned at

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,279
rabbit threshold

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
so you can also download this

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,000
presentation

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,200
let me just start by introducing myself

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,760
i'm one of the debian maintenance and

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,520
followers talkbaiting with me

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,520
i'm also working for great call

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,559
usually i'm developing and supporting

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,559
as an engineer

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,039
there is culture to respect free

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,039
software

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,840
so my character gave me feedback for

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,840
this talk

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,479
in this session this presentation is

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,000
related to backstabbing

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,200
are bad i will not talk about improving

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,119
back debian or

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,119
itself and internal details

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,040
here's the session of the agenda

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,920
first i'll explain why the curious about

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,560
an aurora and show you the traversal

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,759
case

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,320
needs next

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
i'll explain how to solve this situation

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,840
and demonstrate an

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,840
extra problem

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,920
here's the screenshot of black

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,759
deviantart

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,759
i guess you're familiar with it

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,799
in backstabbing oral we need to follow

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,719
the rules

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:09,840
one communicate to each other by email

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,840
to change backstages by sending email

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,080
one day i've received duplicated

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,280
notification for

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,840
call for next call from index is the

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,200
notification efficient

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,319
software

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:37,120
once related to rev app indicator and

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:40,640
the editor is related to deeper stereo

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,640
about rib app indicator just migrated

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
to rib alternate indicator

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,800
about dvd ring i need to fix change

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,120
interfaces

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
and migrate it into g device

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:08,000
two bags about globally next package was

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,000
fixed but as of whatever other purposes

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:18,400
ref indicator and diva theory was

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:21,760
tracked like this

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,080
get rid of indicator there are many

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,080
banks

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,720
against diva theory there are too many

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,720
blocked bags

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,280
in this case we can use user text to

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,280
track bugs

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,080
for rib app indicator air channel app

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,080
indicator is used as user tag

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,879
it should be tagged but user text not

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,760
available for

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,760
devastating

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,320
like this see the case there username is

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,479
not

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,479
always used how to solve this situation

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,199
the answer is using udd udd can track

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:43,840
user tags and

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:43,840
block it back

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,199
so first i fixed or sent feedback to

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,680
sandbags

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,840
i began to fill the foreign one god

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
needed

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,840
tracking is specified by finding a bag

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,479
that no one working on

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:12,160
sending control email in required form

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,160
finding you affected bags

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,360
first topic is solved by using udd

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,360
but how about the rest issue

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:30,479
surely it is good manner to fix the bags

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,479
but it's not easy

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,440
it's also good to try out your bag

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,199
but it may be troublesome

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,400
you know affected parts are also

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,960
important but it is not so easy until it

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,960
hit you

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,479
in the past there are some grave or

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,039
critical bags order to affect food

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,080
seeking

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,360
or growing the user system i want to

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,360
avoid these bags

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:08,960
i've served existing useful services via

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:13,120
debian wiki developer horizon

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
seemed well but not available

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,600
fedor also seemed well but discounted

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,000
already

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,880
i've also heard debug strong in his

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,319
enhancement

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:34,319
cells but it's a bit different

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:37,840
for the world

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:42,240
as a result debian popularity content

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,240
and pattern unity mirror seemed useful

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,319
so i've studied a personal project

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,759
the concept of this project is make a

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,759
stable life comfortable

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,840
it seems that really ridiculous but

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,840
important for me

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,680
to achieve this concept i need to do

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,319
send tasks

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,120
cutting comments for each bag and adding

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,639
separate

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,400
metal games checking install package

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,400
to arrive affected by

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,960
first of all correcting email archives

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,639
proper data

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,199
install package risk and so on are also

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,199
required

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:45,840
to correct email archives we can use pax

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,840
mirror with everything

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,680
email archive contains rob and summary

00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
file

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,879
there are many power modules to handle

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,160
baxter

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:15,520
or related pieces of stuff

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,720
for example row and main module is used

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,720
to pass block file

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
status for view is used to pass signal

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,240
file

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
you can access these bars with a data

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,440
as udd provides public database access

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,399
so we can get proper stress and

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,800
investigate

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,800
which back effect unstable or not

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,920
as popularity content command can create

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
enter

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,519
binary packages information

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,000
it's useful to check recently used

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,000
packet

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,959
after correcting these information

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,839
updating background

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,839
information is required regularly

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,279
i've used deviant-based disk bearings as

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,839
a trigger to update

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,839
and borrow into database

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:37,839
for me and experiment i prepare

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,839
small vps instance

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:45,440
here's a simple diagram for explaining

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,279
the system where server is in the x

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,839
application server is pure and

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
background database is guru

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,320
it access external services email server

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,200
udd for metadata searching for

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,200
authentication

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,480
as a diagram indicate i will name this

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,480
personal system as

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
fiber

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,720
foreign

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,079
i borrowed this name from this country

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,839
similar project

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,839
in decades ago

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:47,839
the concept of this project is make and

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,839
save arrive converter

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,040
here's a person screenshot or feather

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,959
it shows each number of comments

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,839
orange background color means no one

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,839
working on yet

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:15,839
i've added each medical button to set

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,839
the control email

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,959
as a running box box like this

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:32,800
i've added dashboard to show very

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,800
indicates that there are effective bugs

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,839
i'll show you some demos about fiber

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:58,320
i'll demonstrate some features of fibre

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,360
if you're already saying with further

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:10,480
account

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:13,600
you can also sign in with fiverr

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,320
you need explicitly allowed to authorize

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,320
with bible

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,839
after signing in you can access

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,839
the dashboard

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:36,839
in dashboard you can see status

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,639
as you can see there are three affected

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,079
bars

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,079
9 bookmark bars

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,480
and you install 7 and 700 packages

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,959
at the bottom of the dashboard

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,600
you can check the existence of newer

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,200
comments

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
since you commented primary

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,839
let's see the affected banks

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,240
this information is based on your

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,240
installed packages

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,839
let's see the bookmark bags

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,240
in every bag dealer page request button

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,839
is shown

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,839
so you can track you can track back

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
reading

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,680
you can see recent update bugs

00:13:42,639 --> 00:14:03,839
there is critical bugs

00:13:48,000 --> 00:14:03,839
and do new camera bags

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,519
here's the back detail page

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,839
you can view original back report

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,839
or tweet

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,839
bags

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,839
and send cultural email easily

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,320
that's all about proper demonstration

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,199
in the system truck bugs are raised to

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,639
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:00,399
000. utility trucks 90

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,360
000 so it covered most of them

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,199
currently bad information is updated

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,440
every one hour

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,320
and effective banks are also updated

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,320
every one day

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,480
this disk usage is about 1.5 gigabyte

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:27,839
it is a one weak point above fiber

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,839
other memory is occurred 10 times

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,639
there's plenty of room of improvement to

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,600
do work

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,199
so i'll go for this experiment first of

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,399
all

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,320
in experiment i found that my shift some

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:55,839
data sources may improve

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:55,839
user experiences

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,720
okay thanks for the talk

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,120
and we have some questions which i will

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,120
try to

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,519
talk to you so the first question is

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,399
how often is that web interface updated

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,399
with new bugs

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,600
currently this weaving interface is

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,839
updated

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,839
every one hour

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,639
okay

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,839
and the second question is there any way

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,839
to get the turtle and rabbit in my local

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,639
presentations

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,880
so you you can just write that in the

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,920
other pad i think the more important

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,399
question is could you add this

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,839
to the dev box code base directly since

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,839
you're writing perl

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
anyway

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,199
this presentation is excluded by rabbit

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,200
so if you use rabbit you can show the

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,840
title and

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,840
rabbit or your our presentation

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,960
okay so next question would be could you

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,440
add this

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,480
to the dev box code base directly since

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,840
you are writing

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,840
perl anyway

00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,240
it's very hard to directly

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,810
migration because code waste is very

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,160
separated and

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:07,120
[Music]

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,080
i know i'm not familiar with device data

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:15,120
code database

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:18,559
so it's it's hard i think

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,840
okay and then there are two questions

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,400
where is the code and what is the url of

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:29,840
the

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,840
proof of concept

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,720
so did you get the um did you get the

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,480
the other two questions

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,840
there's where is the code and what is

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,840
the url of the proof of concept

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,520
this code is a host's own sensor but

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,720
it's a not fabric so

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,880
it's using private repository

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,880
so currently it's not open

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,960
so do you plan to open it

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:28,880
correctly and deploy to

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,880
my private domain

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:39,840
so currently you cannot access

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,840
to it

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,679
okay so if there are any more questions

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,120
please write them in the other pad

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,960
but i think we are running out of time

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,919
anyway so

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,000
thanks a lot for your talk and you can

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,880
answer more questions

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,440
on the other pet as they come in thank

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,840
you kentaro hayashi

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,840
