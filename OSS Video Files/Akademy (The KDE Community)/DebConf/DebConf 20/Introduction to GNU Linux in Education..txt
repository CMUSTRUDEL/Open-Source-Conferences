# Main Topic
The main point of the talk is to teach that **GNU/Linux and Debian** can be used not just at home but also at University and High School.

I'm going to teach and expand the following topics:
- Brief story about GNU/Linux
- Brief introduction to: Why GNU/Linux instead of Windows?
- Welcome Debian! (Show a bit of Debian's principles and capabilities).
- Why use Debian at University? Can I replace my Windows system for Debian?
- Why spend millions in Microsoft licenses for every single student and not just use free software? (I'm going to cover several software like LibreOffice and show examples of schools and universities that use them)
- Introduction to Moodle and NextCloud implementation (can be used either for students and also teachers)

They will learn the different reasons they should use Debian (teachers & students), Debian's principle and about the definition of Free Software (FSF), how to try and install Debian and information about different software that will be able to replace the propietary things they tend to use.

welcome to my first talk about an

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,359
introduction to gnu linux in education

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,640
it's such an honor to be here at the

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,439

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,119
it's my first time so i hope you'll

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920

student

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,160
engineer a nigerian engineering student

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,399
from university completes madrid

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,680
and i'm also a member of the community

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,680
libre labor fami

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,360
in which we promote free software and

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,280
also cyber security by doing events

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,320
giving speeches even socks

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
so i invite you to join us well let's

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,280
begin

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,520
first i'm going to show you a little

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,399
index about things you're going to

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,480
see like for example these ones you're

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,760
going to learn what's gnu what's linux

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,920
what's free software

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,520
you're also going to learn the different

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,079
types of users don't think it's a

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,120
professional

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,280
way i'm going to just

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,519
tell you the meaning of the root user

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,920
privileged users with sudo commands

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,280
and also on privileged users i'm also

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,080
going to show you some of the desktop

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,439
environments

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,920
and i'm also going to show you how to

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,360
install upgrade and update

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,560
the software you install on your

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,680
computer i'm also going to show you some

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,119
of the

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,680
alternatives you can use on your

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,640
computer by using xcloud

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,799
and also some some some of the things

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,439
that you can use on your daily life

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,360
that are open source that's the main

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,400
point

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,880
let's begin who's this man

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,240
who's this animal this man and this man

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,960
is richard stallman

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
richard salman is the founder of the new

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,240
project

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,520
what's the new project grunu was born in

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,799
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,200
as a project to promote free software

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,280
as a project to promote free software in

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,759
a way that

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
until that time most of the operative

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,040
systems

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,159
were non-free what do i mean when i say

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,399
non-free

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,479
those systems were closed ones and

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,119
developers couldn't see the source code

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,000
so it couldn't be reused on other

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,920
machines

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,760
just some some of them some specifically

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,319
machines not all of them so

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,959
what's the point that's why richard

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
salman

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,640
decided he wanted to make a system

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,040
that was a hundred percent free not just

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,319
95 percent free as he said

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,680
so he developed the gnu on the news

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,160
uh the gnome project system and he also

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
started developing a kernel which is

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,920
like the core

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,800
of a system and that kernel is named

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,319
heard

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,879
it keeps being supported by the

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,280
community and obviously run by the

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,920
free software foundation which is also a

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,720
foundation

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,239
he developed to share free software wait

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,040
a minute now i'm gonna show you

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,680
what's actually free software free

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
software

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,040
has four principles these principles are

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,239
the next ones i'm gonna talk i'm gonna

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,800
tell you about

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,760
okay let's wait wait a minute i'm gonna

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
i'm gonna just read

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,280
actually the actual definition of each

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,239
one so that you can get

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,360
what they actually are the first one is

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,640
the freedom to run

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,080
a program as you wish for any purpose

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,680
for example you could run yeah that's it

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
i mean that's an easy definition

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,680
for the first principle the freedom to

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,360
study how the program works and change

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,280
it so it does your computing

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,519
as you wish that's the freedom number

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,319
one access to the source code is a

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,640
precondition to the 40s that's a cool

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,080
one

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,680
the third one is the freedom to

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,440
redistribute copies

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,879
so you can help others that's the

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,840
freedom number two

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,519
number three sorry and then the freedom

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,640
to distribute copies of your modified

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,239
versions to others

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,319
and by doing this you can give the whole

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,280
community a chance to benefit

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,439
from your changes now i'll give you a

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,319
real example of what happens when you

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,400
are

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,000
free software and when you are in

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,120
professor software

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,799
you are a company you buy something

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,879
some kind of software or some piece of

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,000
software that works with

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,080
data from your clients

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,439
that program one day stops being

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,760
maintained by the

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,360
company i mean you are the only one that

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,519
you're still using it because

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,880
i mean you pay for it why don't why

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,440
don't you keep using it

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,120
if it's working fine but someday as a

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,919
company that was developing it stops

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,360
giving support

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,479
and updates one day one client um

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,800
complains about some error that you had

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,400
that he had on something

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,440
what do you tell him i mean okay

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,600
probably you can fix it doing something

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,720
but not touching the code so what do you

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,960
do i mean

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,240
you lose that client what do you do you

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,720
can't do almost

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,759
anything you are in a closed box where

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,479
you are locked

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,120
and you can get outside of that box

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,040
that's why

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
we need free software because in free

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,120
software you could

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,800
see the code change the code debug the

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,680
code you could see

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,680
what's happening inside of that box you

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,680
could get outside of that box

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,919
straight box and fix the issue so both

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,000
everyone's happy not just you everyone's

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,440
happy that's one of the main points of

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,639
free software i mean if you develop

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
something

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,240
and it's free software people can

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,680
improve it

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,400
uh you can learn with other people too

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,400
i mean if there is there's a project

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,080
there are 100 people working on it i'm

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,479
pretty sure that someone

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,960
something you learn even if you are the

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,199
best something you learn

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,400
and also most of free software projects

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,039
are community driven

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,840
with games which gives them a feeling or

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,560
a sense

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,520
of community and also as i always say

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,960
sharing

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,120
sharing is important in education and

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,280
software used in high school schools and

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,960
also college should be free software

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,360
or at least and they should try to

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
support it not just say okay let's just

00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,840
prove

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,039
these tools and not use anything free

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,319
software but

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,720
that's my opinion so now

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,400
let's see a bit let's go backwards and

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,240
see a bit again

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,479
of uh what's what where were we

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,400
we were that gnu is an operative system

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,160
that was born in 1984

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,960
founded by rachel salman because he

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,360
wanted a unix like operative system

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,400
that was a hundred percent completely

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,319
free

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,759
due to the things i've told you about

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,960
the principles of the free software

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,840
foundation

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,960
so he did it he did it he had it almost

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,880
done

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,919
and then in 1991 linux orwells

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,720
developed the linux kernel on his small

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,039
computer

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,960
he started building his own kernel which

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,080
was linux kernel

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,599
linux and stallman they have each of

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,440
them had different things one had a

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,560
kernel or had the new tools

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,880
so they joined them and then gnu

00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:03,680
started being called gnu linux

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,759
almost every computer running no linux

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,039
basically it's like i don't know what's

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,120
the percentage but gnu

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,800
is obviously the bigger part the kernel

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
like what's a kernel a kernel is

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,160
actually something that

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,840
um computes and manages all the things

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,400
that don't need to run with heart when i

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,360
mean i mean it controls the sharing of

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
the resources

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,680
like processes memory security and all

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,520
this kind of stuff

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,720
that you probably won't know about until

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,560
you study all these things about

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,440
processors and all this kind of stuff

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,599
it's also tell it tells the cpu what to

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,280
do i mean if it's gonna click kill that

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,080
process if it's gonna do

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,639
x thing it controls like how your

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,319
software

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,680
that layer in a certain way it's also

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,680
like i mean it's uh it has a gpl

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,680
200 license so it's going to be called

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,520
open source and it's open source

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,879
and i forgot to tell you the

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,440
pets of gnu is the gnu as you can see

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,960
there

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,160
and the pet of linux is dukes

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,800
which was i don't know who gave him

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,479
the the name talks to the pet but it was

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,759
cool because i think i believe it was

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,039
found in an ftp

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,039
or this that's what they say

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,560
glue is like as you can see the big part

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,080
and then there's linux but

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,720
they fit together gnu also fits with

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,639
other kernels there's for example a

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,479
kernel that's been run by the free

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,919
source foundation it's been built by the

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,880
community i mean it's free software

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,839
so people can improve it can can help in

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,959
the development

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,080
which is called herd so we will see also

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,800
this shows in the future

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,599
with new herd instead of granola linux

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,279
it's cool

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,399
they're in they exist already but they

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,399
are not 100 percent

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,120
secure to use on a daily basis like for

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,200
example okay gnu linux

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,160
here's a periodic table of the different

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,480
gnu linux

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,360
distros you have like linux mint you

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,880
have deviant you have

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,880
wound up ubuntu all these kind of

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,880
distress there's debian as you can see

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,000
it has the number two popularity

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,440
and it was built and it was born in 1996

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,680
the founder who was the founder of

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,200
debbie it was ian murdock

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,120
uh it was ian murdock and

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,800
the main features about debbie and

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,519
ginger linux that i want you

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
to learn are that it's community driven

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,959
it has

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
over 1 000 volunteers all over the world

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,160
for

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,519
you even you can be for example a

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,120
volunteer for debian

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,560
you can help in the translation you can

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,240
help in the web pages

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
you can have them packages you can help

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,360
in lots of things if you're a developer

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,800
of course you can help

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,720
obviously you need to follow the

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,600
guidelines and all this on all the stuff

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,640
that's uh

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,320
quoted on their website and conduct and

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,000
show conduct and all this kind of stuff

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,399
but you can help so

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,360
i invite you to look for it on the

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,760
debian website

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
about different ways to contribute

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,040
there's also

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
lots of packages i mean there you are

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,959
there are over 5000 packages

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,079
that you can use in debian gnu linux

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,440
5000 practice is a lot it's a lot

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,360
most of them are maintained by the

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,320
community but really five thousand

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,160
practices it's a lot

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,640
and now you're probably asking what's a

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,079
package i haven't heard that word before

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,120
i mean what's that a package is like

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,720
the term software it's a it's not

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,720
software yeah it's software it could be

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,399
called software it's like the executable

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,320
files you tend to download in microsoft

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,519
windows you click it you install it

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,279
it's basically the same thing and also i

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,720
chose debian i choose debian because

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,399
it's easy to use

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,560
so it's pretty cool now let's keep going

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,920
let's keep going i have you have lots of

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,000
things to see

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,079
the first steps with devin the first

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,320
steps with debian are the different

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,320
desktop environments you can see in this

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,000
picture you have gnome you have kde

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,040
you have x fc e4 you have lxde which is

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
a lightweight

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,800
desktop it's really awesome for for

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,959
example machines too

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,120
so it's pretty cool you have even made

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,240
you have lots of desktop environments

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
and now you're asking

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,000
if i choose one do i have to stay with

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,160
one of these desktop environments or

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,760
what's a desktop environment

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,519
in windows you are tied up to the same

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,880
desktop environment i mean you can

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,640
change anything

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,959
or you can change things but not

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,000
everything on change linux you can

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,440
change

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,560
everything you can be a gnome user you

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,440
can be a kte

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,560
user or you can be a normal kde user you

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,959
don't have to be

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,079
uh tied up to one of those desktop

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,640
environments you can use

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,200
two three you can use whatever you want

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,279
that's

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
freedom and that's a really cool thing

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,600
about the alien

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,440
you have freedom you can choose

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,880
you can choose which in whatever desktop

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,360
environment you want

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,959
do i'm going to talk later about how to

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,519
install debian in a virtual machine

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,560
and you'll see you can choose whatever

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,800
desktop environment

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,839
you want it's according to you you

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,560
decide

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,399
it's it's your feeling your taste let's

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,720
say

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,600
now we've got also several things in

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,639
devin on

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,720
in almost in general linux sisters we

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,240
have a term that's called the users

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,839
obviously as in windows you have the

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,240
local an administrator

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,320
and that's it at least on a daily basis

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,360
then you have in debian you have like

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,079
the root user

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,600
i draw and there's a i didn't draw it

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,360
there's a really cool penguin which is

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,000
the crown yeah it's a reducer

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,200
the root user has the power to do

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,760
whatever he wants

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,560
he is the one that manages the system

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,959
for example

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,160
you have a home computer you have your

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,000
house computer or

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,200
your home computer in your crew in your

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
living room

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,760
so imagine the root user would be like

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,600
your father or your mother the one who

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,800
controls that computer and knows what to

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
install and what to

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,880
don't install he's the only one that can

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,440
do things

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,800
the rest of them can't do anything i

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,440
mean yeah they can

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,720
browse they can't watch videos they can

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,120
do that kind of things

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,760
but they can't install things they are

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,040
like

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,760
the others are regular users or they

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,680
could be

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,079
privileged users with suitable

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,160
permissions once as privileged users

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,079
user restored permissions it's a regular

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,120
user but that has some

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,600
more permissions imagine you want your

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
brother to be able to update and upgrade

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,839
the system

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,200
while uh your sister or your

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,160
or your father or you or you could only

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,519
just

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,560
install software it's basically uh the

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,920
same thing

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,079
that's why and i um i put that

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,480
in the mail or the root a regular user

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,399
because it's not a fully root

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,480
it could have the same permissions as a

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,600
root user but it's not

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,079
the same as root is like the god

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
the code of the d of the system is root

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,800
user

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,600
so there could be only one now let's see

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,839
when you open

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,880
up the console the first thing you'll

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,040
notice is that

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,800
there's a user a hostname and a place

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,720
where you are you're probably thinking

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,320
what's the host name i don't have any

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,160
idea what's the hostname

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
i've seen consoles on movies like

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,600
imagino i've

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,360
like those hacking movies where you see

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,240
a console pop up and they print hello

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,680
world like

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,800
lots of times in a loop a console

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,760
consists of these things

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,639
the first word would be the user i mean

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,040
it could be you

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,639
it could be root it could be my father

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,160
it could be anyone

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,000
i mean obviously it's a user on that

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,160
system the second

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,760
then the host name the hostname imagine

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,480
when you have several computers on a

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,279
network

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,920
you would like to each one of them to be

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,160
a

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,920
thing for example the living room

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,040
computer which could be the host time

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,240
leaving from computer the the university

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
computer could be the university

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,519
computer as a host team

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,279
to recognize them when you for example

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,399
try to control it in a remote way

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,399
because you can

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,360
be server via ssh that i'm not going to

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,199
show you in this video

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,040
you can control your computer remotely

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,519
and you don't have to have and you don't

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
need

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,199
any graphical interface you could

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,480
control it with your phone like typing

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,440
it's pretty awesome then linux are

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,560
awesome

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,760
and also there's like that kind of

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,320
way i don't know how to say it in

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,360
english which is the place where you are

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,320
if you are in your in your for example

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,920
let's see a real example you are in your

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,279
videos folder

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:35,040
that route would be slash home

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,279
slash your username slash videos

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,399
or if you are in your download downloads

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,360
folder it would be

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,399
slash home slash your username slash

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,240
downloads

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,639
or and if you are in your desktop what

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,920
would it be it would be slash home slash

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,079
your username slash

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,519
desktop it's pretty simple and it's

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,600
pretty intuitive

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,279
once you use them anyway you're going to

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,480
learn more then when i show you the

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,160
virtual box and i'm going to

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,079
write some commands that are going to

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,720
help you learn about several things

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,519
now how do you keep up updated in a

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,480
debian

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,199
system you can keep updated using two

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,720
ways

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,759
you can keep updated using the

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,160
sudo apt update command sudo

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:23,600
aptitude update command thanks to what

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,320
thanks what or how those commands work

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,079
those commands work thanks to mere

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
repositories repositories what are

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,920
repositories

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,560
is like imagine you have like uh it's

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,959
like

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,160
yeah imagine you have a place where all

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,000
your files

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,440
are but obviously you're a company i

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,720
mean you are not your

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,399
they are not your videos or your

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
pictures it's like where you have the

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,639
software well repositories are places

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
where they have lots and lots and lots

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,720
of software it doesn't have to be just

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,680
one software it could be lots of them

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,240
and packages are that pieces of software

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,639
then that boxes of software are packages

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,079
each software is a package that's

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,639
basically the point and then there are

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,720
mirror

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
mirrors for example you have here a

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,559
building in spain

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,760
or in portugal or wherever where you

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,880
have some software

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,039
so if you live in the other in the other

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,160
if you live in another country far away

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,319
it's

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,679
it's hard to connect to the network here

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,439
or at least it will take

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,880
that time due to pink and all this

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,600
network stuff so

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,760
if you have mirrors are like copies of

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,839
that repository all over the world so

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,960
there are mirrors like for example in

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,480
each country it could be like seven

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,640
mirrors it depends on the country

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,000
but there are lots of them and during

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,080
the installation of debian

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,400
you'll see that it says do you want to

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,880
use a network mirror you just click yes

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,960
and then

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,720
you just need to choose what mirror do

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,320
you want to use for example i use spain

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,360
my students organization mirror which is

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,840
different level family

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,120
which is one of the which is really

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,240
great and it's one of the

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,200
fastest in spain and then

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,440
you could also use like the instead of a

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,440
command line where you need to write

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,200
pseudo apt update if you are sure if you

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,160
are root you just write apt update or

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
aptitude update

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,240
but if instead of writing that you could

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,640
also use the graphical tool which is

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,039
called

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,400
synaptic synaptic is a graphical tool

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,559
that lets you manage

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,440
all these packages it's like using the

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,240
command line but

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,000
graphically personally i prefer to use

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,080
the command line because i feel like

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,720
i've got more control on what do i

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,160
or of what i'm doing but you could also

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,160
use the graphical tool if you

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,720
if you really want to i mean it's

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,120
perfectly cool

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,799
now how do you manage files as i've told

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,799
you i was gonna show you some commands

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,679
and i'm gonna do it

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,120
you can change you can manage files in a

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,440
very very easy way

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,200
using commands but don't worry those

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,120
commands aren't like those

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,799
typical commands with slashes and all

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,760
this kind of stuff in both games and all

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,840
this kind of stuff

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,880
they are pretty simple and they are very

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,960
intuitive to learn

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,160
for example move as you can see in the

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,120
slide movies

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,080
mb and v it's pretty simple i mean move

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,280
mv

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,240
in your head i mean it makes sense

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,720
remove is rm it's pretty simple too and

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,880
there are

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,400
lots and lots and lots of these commands

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,440
so now i'm gonna

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,080
show you a bit about how do these

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,720
commands

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,000
work let me change this to so that you

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,360
are able to see

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,799
how do they work let me change this

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,000
okay and change this to the bm okay

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,559
now we are in the vm uh let's see

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,280
if i can open the vm okay i'm in the vm

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,679
great

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,960
now i put input the password now here we

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,640
are using

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:40,080
debian here's a terminal

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,000
ls for example to list files clear now

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
as i've told you you could use for

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,039
example the

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,080
cp command to copy well let's let's see

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,679
first

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,679
the routes that you are able to go

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,039
if you write ls which is list files

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,280
you'll see that you can go to desktop

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,600
documents downloads music pictures

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,320
let's let's go to the desktop you are

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,960
now

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,919
under this is the same as home and

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,919
desktop

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,919
it's pretty simple if you want to go

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,480
backwards you just write cd

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,280
what cd cd is change directory just

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,919
write cd

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,960
and two dots two dots is like going

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,440
backwards because

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,120
one dot is the same directory what do i

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,960
mean when i say this

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,760
for example suppose you create uh

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,120
to create something inside the desktop

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,480
inside the desktop let's see

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,960
desktop hey nano is a text editor just

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,640
click now hello world

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,840
hello ctrl o to

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,840
save it and now as you can see

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,159
there's our hello world file that we

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,440
just created

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,559
so now we go we want to copy hello world

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,840
to backwards so we just write

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,720
hello world dot dot flash

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,200
i believe it's that command let me check

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,760
okay

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,640
that's the command just write cp hello

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,360
world dot dot

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,440
slash and now suppose we want to copy

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,679
hello world we want to move

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
we want to copy that hello world in the

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,919
same directory

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,000
but we don't think they i mean we want

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,000
to change that name we just say hello

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,480
world hello

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,720
that's that's it it changed it's pretty

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,080
quick and simple

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,679
you could also use the file the files i

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,159
mean you can also use this tool

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,039
you could it's quick it's simple imagine

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,200
hello world too

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,600
you just click it here rename click ok

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,960
and that's it it's pretty quick and it's

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,000
pretty simple

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,919
so now let's go backwards backwards

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,440
and now let's get back with the

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,919
presentation well

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,039
let me just show you first how to update

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,360
so that you know

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,520
how to you can update using now let's go

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,039
to the sudo user

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,440
okay now in my now i'm the root user

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,559
i'm in the family pc hostname and i'm in

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,720
the slash

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,880
air materials which is my username so

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,520
now to update we just write or suggest

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,159
update or apt update never mind now it's

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,320
as

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,600
as i've told you these are the mirrors

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,080
i've told you about

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,520
before and it's really packaged at least

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,919
all the packages are up to date

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,360
it's pretty cool it's update and they

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,919
are an upgrade with me

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,799
with the upgrade command now imagine you

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,039
want to install

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,919
the synaptic synaptic i believe it's

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,080
written like that

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,080
okay synaptic is set to manually install

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,840
so now let's open it i don't know if

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,480
this is command yeah segment

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,919
okay now as you can see you have all

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,120
these packages here

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,640
you have all the repositories here

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,640
it's pretty quick and it's pretty simple

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,679
to use

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,799
so now let's jump back to the

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,840
presentation

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,679
let's jump back okay i'm here

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,760
let's jump back to the presentation okay

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,880
everything's cool now let's jump back to

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,440
the presentation yeah

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,520
here we are now let's meet some tools

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,440
that we you could use as an alternative

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,520
to the typical software you tend to use

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,240
in ga in windows sorry i was going to

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,400
call change windows

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,360
email client your play used to use the

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,000
browser but

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,919
imagine you are a user that wants to use

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,240
a desktop email client

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,280
you could use thunderbird by run by

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,320
mozilla

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,799
or you could use gary used by

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,840
developed by gnome or run by gnome and

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,720
also elementary os which is another

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,159
distro

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,559
thunderbird is like more full of things

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,200
i mean

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,840
it's more developed in that way i mean

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,320
it's

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,360
older but it has lots and lots of things

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,760
it has lots of

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,520
plugins to encrypt emails you can do

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,880
lots and lots of things with thunderbird

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,880
and there's gary too gary's cool too but

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,240
it has a more simple design it's

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,039
different it's

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,520
but both are pretty awesome then if you

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,320
want to

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,120
just use an online mail app like for

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,200
example you

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,720
usually go to protomail or gmail or

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,480
whatever email you have

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,840
you could use the next cloud mail app

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,400
you can search up your email there

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,120
and you don't need to go outside of your

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,279
next cloud

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,039
mail app it's pretty simple pretty cool

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,039
and you can do lots of things like for

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,200
example when someone sends you a pdf

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,960
you can make a flow in next code that

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,440
change that pd that

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,720
makes that pdf go into another folder

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,799
and delete that the email for example

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,320
then an alternative to the adobe

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,679
products and although as an alternative

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,640
to adobe products you have

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,039
 run by gnome you have krita you

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
know

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,159
run by kde you have lots and lots of

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,200
things

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,120
uh by guinea i i personally use

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,279
you have lots and lots and lots of

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,000
documentation on their official website

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,200
it's amazing it's really cool and i

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,039
really

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,360
i really like it's a it's a pretty

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,679
cool software and there's also krita

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,880
krita it's run by kde as you can see

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,000
that logo

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,720
and it's more similar to

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,840
an adobe photoshop i believe i didn't

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
use it that much but

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,880
it's like more similar to adobe

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,320
photoshop

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,320
then you've got if you want to work in

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,559
vectors you have the inkscape

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,360
escape is a typical program to both

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,600
windows and

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,559
gnu lyrics so i won't talk a bit a lot

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,320
about it i mean it's cool it's inkscape

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,559
and then you've got different video

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,240
tools to substitute their sony vegas pro

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
camtasia all this kind of private

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,640
software that

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,080
you know what that you don't know what's

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,880
running behind they could be stealing

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,559
your data

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,000
we don't know we don't know what's wrong

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,559
behind

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,520
so you could use kde and live which is

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,000
run by kde

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,440
obviously by the name the name says it

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,840
and you or you could run

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,880
up and shut openshot it's also open

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,799
source so

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
both of them are open source both of

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,880
them are pretty awesome

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,000
pretty cool and they are simple they are

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,320
not that simple to use

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,240
but you could learn and it's open source

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,159
so you know what's running behind

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,000
it's and give it a shot i mean it's cool

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,320
then you've got the syncing with your

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,200
phone imagine you're using

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,520
your computer and you want to use the

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,159
typical thing of copy and paste

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,960
from your phone to your computer perhaps

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,840
you use

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,799
the typical telegram app and you go to

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,880
save messages

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,320
and you just write it there copy it on

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,480
the pc and that's it

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,080
well with kde connect you don't have to

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,320
do anything of that

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,440
i mean you can control your phone or you

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,880
can control your pc

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,520
using the your pc or your phone

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,520
it's pretty it's a pretty mix of words a

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,760
pretty mix up words but it's pretty

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,039
it's pretty cool you can i don't know

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
you can write commands you can paint to

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,799
see if the computer is there

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,760
you can do lots and lots of things and

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,760
even you

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,120
you can even control the multimedia

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,880
which is an awesome thing

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,320
or your presentations which is also a

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,240
cool thing to do

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,440
then you've got like for example hoplin

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,240
hoplin it's a

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,360
node editor uh it's like a node cli a

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,120
nodes client

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,200
you could use it with the next cloud you

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,919
could use it in a terminal uh

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,320
in a terminal way you used it in many

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,000
many

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,000
things hopefully it's pretty cool but

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,760
there are lots and lots of open source

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,400
kind of apps to nodes calendar all this

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,039
kind of thing there are lots of them

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,679
and for backups i tend to suggest our

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,880
clone

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,320
wireclone our clone can sync with google

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,960
drive you can sync with next cloud you

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,720
can sync with

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,240
dropbox you can sync with lots of things

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,679
i always suggest text cloud because i

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,080
mean it's there for it's the open source

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,720
one

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,200
free software one but if you use the

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,120
other ones

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,799
you could use it as well as with the

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,679
other ones i mean you can even

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,480
you can encrypt before uploading things

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,840
to the cloud

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,640
which is a a good way to say to see that

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,240
your data

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,600
is safe and then we've got next cloud

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,559
what's next cloud

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,799
i really love next cloud next slot has

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,000
an

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,000
hpl v3 license what do i mean

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,399
it's free software as it says there in

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,080
the slide it's free as in freedom

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,600
next cloud is also multi-platform you

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,000
can use it on your phone you can start

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,559
your

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
computer there's there are desktop apps

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,480
for your phone there are desktop apps

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,640
for your

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,320
computer there's also a mobile app for

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,600
your phone whether you run android you

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,279
run eos you could use it

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,080
and you can also use it on your browser

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,760
you do not depend on this kind of things

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,679
what do you typically need to set up

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,399
next cloud you typically need a web

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,480
server

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,159
or a database a web server i usually

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,960
suggest a patch web server

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,679
or a database i usually suggest maria

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,480
but

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,360
in this demo we'll see how to run docker

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,559
what's docker

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,039
docker is when it's like a box where you

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,080
run things inside of it it's like a

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,880
virtual machine

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,360
but in a different way it's more a box

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,880
it's

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,000
everything you do inside that container

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,960
won't affect what's on the outside more

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,919
or less it's

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,799
that same concept how do you run a

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,200
container

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,559
first you need to install docker then

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,679
you need to run that command

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,720
so now it's demo time we'll learn how to

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,960
run docker and

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,360
how to install that container to run it

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,799
and to see how next file works

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,080
so now let's go again to our bm which we

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,120
were seeing before

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,320
okay now we are here we are on our pm

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,799
let me just click here okay now

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,200
let's go to our browser we got here the

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,399
web browser

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,399
okay here we are

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,840
okay the first thing i'm going to go is

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,320
to drco.com

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,960
now i'm going to search for the docker

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,360
wiki

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,360
install

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,799
okay so now here we've got the install

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,600
docker in gianni deviant

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,720
now we click there and it takes a bit of

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,080
time to load

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,640
but it will load uh anyway

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,960
while we are working on this okay now

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,559
yeah okay it's cool it's cool

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,399
as you can see the first step is

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,080
installed using the repository

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,000
as i told you about in the repositories

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,720
there are packages and repositories

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,480
repositories are in different kind in

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,159
different mirrors all over the world

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,720
so that you can download things without

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,360
having to wait that much

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,000
so how do we set up that repository we

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,480
need to

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,840
update our packages as i told you before

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,360
to update it's

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,640
using that apt update

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,840
we just need to write here apt update

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,480
okay we click enter it's uh trying to

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,559
update

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,600
uh as i've told you my network speed is

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,720
not that fast

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,480
so let's wait until it updates and then

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,600
what we have to do is to install these

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,880
things the apt

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,720
transport https the ca certificates cool

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,080
i'm not going to explain what's in

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,120
what's each one of these because we are

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,919
running a bit

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,279
out of out of time but anyway i'm going

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,600
to show you how to do it

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,600
we just click just copy it paste it and

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,120
that's pretty simple i mean i believe on

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,960
those things because i know what's in

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,120
each of these things and now we need to

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,559
add the docker's official gpg key

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,799
i'm not going to explain either what's a

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,240
gpg key because i'm just going to tell

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,080
you it's like a safe method

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,679
that to know that you are downloading

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,720
something from the official

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,720
repository i mean you are not uh there's

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,640
no one in the middle trying to change

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,480
that software for you to install like

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,039
some kind of malware or some kind of

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,640
all those kind of things now we need to

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,399
add a repository we just click

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:14,960
copy paste okay and now we install

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:18,080
the our docker engine okay paste it

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,279
couldn't find okay you see i forgot to

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,320
do an update

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,679
let's do an update and then okay now

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,720
it's taking them from docker

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,760
now we just run it okay yes i want to

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,760
install them

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,360
it's probably going to take some time

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,919
but i'm going to show you

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,559
how after this you should run the

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,880
command i

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,679
show you in the slide which is the

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,080
command

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,960
but as i don't have that much time i'm

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,000
gonna show you

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,120
how to run how a next cloud instance

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,519
can run i mean how it runs how is it

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,320
cool

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,440
i'm gonna use my students organization

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,720
instance

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,840
so wait hold on a second i'm gonna just

00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,360
use the password i'm just gonna input

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,640
the password for you to see how it works

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:08,320
okay hold on a second here it is okay

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,880
that's cool we log in

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:15,840
and okay i wrote the wrong username and

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,840
password i don't know why what

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,320
okay wrong username and password let me

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,880
try again with my

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,880
username

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:31,200
okay now i'm in it took a bit of time

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,120
okay now it's opening it it probably

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,600
takes a little bit of time sometimes

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,840
okay now as you can see i've got like

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,000
lots of documents let me change

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,279
the display fast let me change a bit of

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,919
display because i

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,480
didn't change it before okay apply okay

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,480
here it's

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,919
here it is it's way much better for you

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,600
probably okay

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,039
now you can see all these kind of things

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,559
this is my own cloud

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,320
i can create a new document that's

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:59,600
called i don't know uh

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,600
hello world a deb

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,240
uh it's creating it or did i click

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:11,039
okay yeah it's cool if not i'm gonna use

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,559
just use one of these

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,080
it probably takes some some time because

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,720
i'm in a foreign country and i don't

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,519
have that much

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,360
network speed but it's gonna take it

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,440
takes it takes a while to load

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,519
let me check let me let's see how our

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,360
docker instance is running

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,399
okay right now it didn't it didn't work

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,840
but i'm gonna show you some notes for

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,880
example here you could write your own

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,559
note high

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,559
def 2020

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,600
like here you could write like hi this

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,679
is a markdown i believe yeah

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,559
it's a markdown hello world hello world

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,440
this is like notes you can sync them

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,679
with your phone

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,360
for example here's the calendar you just

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,919
click on calendar

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,720
and here as you can see you've got like

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,399
different

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,880
different days you just click here you

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,519
just need to to add an event even title

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,399
you can have

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,200
even different kinds of calendar here

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,799
you can have

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,399
you all your contacts i mean you can

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,839
sync the nexus

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,359
app with your phone which is a pretty

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,200
cool thing to do i mean it's your own

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,440
cloud you can do whatever you want

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,639
i mean it's your own cloud just be sure

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,000
to be updated

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,000
in a way that's pretty safe now it's

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,040
starting it's taking a little bit too

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,879
low because of my

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,599
again because of my network speed and

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,440
here we can add for example let's see a

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,440
new contact i'm going to call him

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,440
for example kevin okay he doesn't let me

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,919
write right now

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,040
uh home we can write here the phone

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,560
number we can write

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,320
lots of things i mean you can even have

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,760
groups we can even

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,919
import our contacts with our data

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,839
from our phone you can select the file

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,560
you can import them

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,839
one great benefit you are used to you

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,960
you are used to

00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:02,000
typically talk using gt

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,200
google meat all these kind of tools now

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,599
you can use your own instance tool which

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,800
is

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,640
talk with talk you could you can call as

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,680
you can see i've called myself

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,040
you can call people and you can talk

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,800
with them you can assign them to

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,960
projects in the next cloud

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,119
and you can do lots of things for

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,320
organization for organization this is

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,839
great here you have photos activity but

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,720
while as i told you i want to show you

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:31,119
some things that are pretty awesome

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,839
let's see here you can add your personal

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,880
details

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,560
but let's go to i believe okay

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,520
i don't know here you have also the

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,000
users okay i can see it because i'm not

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,119
an

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,280
administrator as you can see

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,040
what i was going to tell you is in your

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,040
next cloud instance you're going to have

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,079
different groups you can have for

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,480
example a group that's

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,160
an administrator that has a limit up to

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,520
50 gigabytes for example

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,520
and on the other hand you can have

00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,000
regular users which is

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,040
their limit it's like i don't know 10

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,480
gigabytes

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:07,280
you can also filter by ip address

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,720
what's uh what people can download this

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,200
is good for example when you want to

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,359
share

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,320
like a file that can only be seen by

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,599
certain people

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,440
in restricted using a restricted vpn

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,640
for them to see or if you live in a

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,200
house or if

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,040
or in your home you could just restrict

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,040
that file to be accessed

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,079
inside your home not outside using that

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,560
ip

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,720
or for example you could just restrict a

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,200
file to be used in a geographical zone

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,359
area

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,200
that would be weird yes but some people

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,000
want to do it you could do it

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,119
you can also you can do really lots of

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,440
stuff

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,480
lots of lots and lots and lots of stuff

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,920
plus there are over i believe it's 500

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,320
different kind of extensions that you

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,960
can install contacts male calendar nodes

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,520
are just

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,560
one of the simpler ones that are in the

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,599
next cloud each

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,599
instance but there are lots of them and

00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,280
you as i've told you you for example can

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,440
share links with others you can share

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,880
internal link and you can even create a

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,520
project and add into a project for

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,200
example

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,119
let's call it uh my decision is the

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,920
global theme there is no project but

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,760
if it's if it were it would be it would

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,040
be linked or you can even link it to a

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,839
conversation

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,800
or to file so here you can share it with

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,560
others

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,000
you can do lots and lots and lots of

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,760
stuff and you even can

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,920
be search for other versions you can add

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,760
tags you can add a tag that's convert to

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,520
pdf and when you upload

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,320
that file it's gonna convert it to a pdf

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,000
i mean you have lots and lots and lots

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,680
of things to do

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,760
i'm just gonna take this last minute to

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,480
see to share with you a project that we

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,920
are developing

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,839
we are developing a project that

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,160
consists of a cloud among

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,119
universities and schools and high

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,200
schools

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,240
first we are the step one is across

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,520
universities

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:55,280
that in which students can share their

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,520
notes they take in their classrooms in a

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,880
open source and freeway they don't have

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,480
to give their data to

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,280
third-party providers and all these kind

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,760
of people that just want their data

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,880
they give them money but you give them

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,680
your data i mean

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,960
they sell your data it's it's not

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,880
ethical i believe

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,359
and plus in this way of sharing uh notes

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,640
in this freeway in the next slot we are

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,440
also

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,880
checking in the permissions of the files

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,599
for example if you share

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,000
the notes that the teacher gave you we

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,599
need

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,440
like to have like the permission from

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,240
the author either by

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,079
a license or any kind of stuff that says

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,359
you have the right to upload that thing

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,960
to this website

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,240
so everything will be cool everything

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,520
will be safe and everything will be

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,599
legal and ethical

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,160
because everything will be cool i mean

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,680
we won't sell your data we promise

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,920
so if you want to keep involved in

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,520
our projects or in that project you just

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,920
need to search for us

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,359
and yeah that's cool you can contact us

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,160
and master on matrix we

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,920
even have our own instance telegram

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,680
whatever social network you want to

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,760

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,920
enjoyed i hope you

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,200
liked this small introduction to general

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,440
linux in education

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,599
and i hope you really use next cloud

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,480
because the last step would be to run

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,640
the container

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,560
you could try it it just run the command

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,880
click next click install

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,760
and it was really such an honor to be

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,599
here at devconf2020 today with you

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,280
and i hope you learn more and more and

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,000
more about this world every day

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,119
and so that you are able to see all the

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,560
other talks

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,560
after this one uh thank you so much

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,560
for listening and if you want to contact

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,079

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:57,839
networks so be safe stay safe

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:57,839
and have a nice day

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,599
you learn how to how to develop for that

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,440
thing

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,040
and you also know how to use that thing

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,200
in a better way plus

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,079
obviously it's like the story of how

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,960
everything began

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,520
begin so i think it's really something

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,480
that

00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,640
should be taught at schools and colleges

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,359
just to make the users know that there's

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,280
more than

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,400
like that that microsoft windows stuff

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,480
that people

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,560
used to know and just i mean they don't

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,000
know the alternatives so

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,560
yeah awesome cool um

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,440
i just said thank you thank you a lot

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,240
for your talk

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,040
it's very inspiring motivating um what

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,800
do you consider

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,560
the main obstacles in spain currently

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,440
for universities and schools to

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:30,319
uh do uh to do uh

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,480
administrative stuff to not use more

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,680
free software in their classes with the

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,560
students and also with the

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,560
administrative staff

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,160
i believe in the main obstacle as i've

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,760
said is like the the

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,839
the first step would be the government i

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,920
mean the government tend to suggest

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,040
property software productive software

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,359
instead of

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,720
free software so then in the high school

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,440
psychologist at least from what i've

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,920
heard

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,800
they tend to like believe on those

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,319
recommendations

00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,200
and not try to use different software so

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,880
and that could be like the first step to

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,359
share the campaign public money public

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,480
code

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,160
and all these campaigns about

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,040
universities from the result of

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,920
foundation

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,720
and also try to suggest teachers and

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,119
students

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,240
about the different alternatives not

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,839
just let them

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,760
work with like for example this will

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:19,599
code like for example at my college

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,200
but let them know that there are

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,720
different alternatives and they can use

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,000
whatever they want because they should

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,520
be at least free

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,280
i mean if they want to take a

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,240
responsibility for something

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,920
at least they can they should be able to

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,160
they shouldn't be like

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:39,440
made in that box where they can't go out

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,599
yeah that's fixed um

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,240
okay someone may look comment this talk

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,359
will be very nice to newcomers and

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:50,640
that yeah that's good we're recording it

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,359
um uh this is

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,359
have you uh

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,680
okay uh so do you have a solution with

00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,000
gnu such links for secure browser for

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,440
test

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,640
taking um i don't have like

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,000
um i don't have like that kind of

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,440
solution i mean

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,400
it's it's a very difficult topic because

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,040
they need to

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,440
like this yeah what the student is going

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,319
through

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,760
so yeah it's a it's a hard thing to it's

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,079
a really hard thing to do

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,720
i'm not in that area so i don't know

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:26,800
really what could be the best solution

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:30,000
um yeah i really don't know what

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,560
to use in that case

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,760
um i'm a computer science student at the

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,880
institute of mathematics

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:40,560
and at esthetics at the

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,960
universidad de sao paulo we've always

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,640
had

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,240
the linux spirit our teachers were some

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,480
of the first to install

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,319
it at the universities nowadays sadly

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,119
there are more and more windows users

00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,200
each year here

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,560
we try to show how easy and marvelous

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,800
debian is for example

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,640
but it's hard to change people's minds

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,920
what do you do to convince people to try

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,000
debian

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,599
i tend to let them know that most

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,200
software they use they don't know what

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,880
they are using i tend to

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,400
for example start the articles of all

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,280
the different things that property

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,720
software

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,720
tends to to show them also about

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,400
the different things they can make in

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,920
general linux i mean

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,520
obviously on deviant they can do

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,280
whatever they want i always tell them

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,040
that they can do whatever they want

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,880
they are not in that box where they

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,800
can't do anything

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,160
they they know what happens they can

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,640
check logs they can check

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,200
how everything is working from the base

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,599
to the

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,119
to the front end i mean they can do

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,839
anything and they can check

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,440
plus as someone as not to accept is is

00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,079
expensive but property software is

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
expensive

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,440
if a high school instead of paying

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,160
microsoft uh licenses to

00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,800
all this kind of software is try to use

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,079
more of

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,400
the free software of the free software

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,680
they would really and they wouldn't

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,720
spend that much money

00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,280
instead and users will be free i mean

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,119
they they users really need to be free

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,680
and students really need to be free

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,119
and people need to learn that there's an

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,200
alternative

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,880
because when they are like young at

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,560
younger ages they only know

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,040
one thing that exists that is microsoft

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,119
windows so if we share from an early age

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,119
that there are alternatives and other

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,520
things exist

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,440
people could try and use them but if we

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,760
do if we do not show them from their

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,119
early ages they will need to learn it by

00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,640
themselves but yeah

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,640
i mean we should try and share it and

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,960
share all this software with teachers

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,920
one also at high schools because

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,680
software exists

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,160
and the students can use them

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,920
okay um there's only there's one last

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,720
question here already a minute over

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,800
um it doesn't seem to be would you

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,480
recommend flat pack or snap or app image

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,280
for the average user

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,960
i mean i didn't i thought tech i've used

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,480
it like i'm very few i don't

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,480
recommend it because i didn't use it

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,200
that much i mean people

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,000
people know more about them than myself

00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,480
uh snap i think snap it's easy to use

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,520
and then app image doesn't really really

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,560
need an

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,960
installation so app image would be um

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,920
easy stuff and also snap i'm in between

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,240
one of those

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,680
