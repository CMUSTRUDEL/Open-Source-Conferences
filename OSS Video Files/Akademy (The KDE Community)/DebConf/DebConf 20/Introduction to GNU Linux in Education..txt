# Main Topic
The main point of the talk is to teach that **GNU/Linux and Debian** can be used not just at home but also at University and High School.

I'm going to teach and expand the following topics:
- Brief story about GNU/Linux
- Brief introduction to: Why GNU/Linux instead of Windows?
- Welcome Debian! (Show a bit of Debian's principles and capabilities).
- Why use Debian at University? Can I replace my Windows system for Debian?
- Why spend millions in Microsoft licenses for every single student and not just use free software? (I'm going to cover several software like LibreOffice and show examples of schools and universities that use them)
- Introduction to Moodle and NextCloud implementation (can be used either for students and also teachers)

They will learn the different reasons they should use Debian (teachers & students), Debian's principle and about the definition of Free Software (FSF), how to try and install Debian and information about different software that will be able to replace the propietary things they tend to use.
