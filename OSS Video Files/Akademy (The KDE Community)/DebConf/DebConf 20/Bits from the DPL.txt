welcome to bits from the dpl

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,519
at depconf20 online this talk is

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,200
pre-recorded

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,960
but there will be a live session at the

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,920
end of this talk for questions

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
and comments

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,520
so a bit about myself my name is

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,720
jonathan carter and

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,439
my debian account name is jcc i'm 38

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,519
years old

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,519
and the quickest way to summarize myself

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,519
is as a free software hacker

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,640
i'm not a computer scientist i just

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,880
learn as much as i can

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,800
in all directions and hack away at

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,640
problems until i find solutions

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,760
and i enjoy doing so i'm from cape town

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,760
in south africa

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,840
that's the most southern city in africa

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,960
that makes me the second dpl to be born

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,079
in africa after

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,320
mediterki so if you want to stay in

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,480
touch you can contact me on rsc where

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
are known as high voltage follow me on

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,199
the fetives

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,600
or if you'd like to know more about my

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,359
work in debian you can visit my wiki

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,239
page

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,320
and that's enough about me personally so

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,920
what exactly is it that the dpl

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,880
actually does within the project

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,360
so externally the dpl represents the

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,159
project

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,600
publicly talk about debian technical

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,439
events and trade shows

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
build and maintain relationships with

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,840
external entities

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,159
and sets up contracts and handle legal

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,000
matters

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,520
due to covet 19 giving talks at

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,560
conferences have been limited

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,400
but i've made i've managed to give two

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,040
talks at debian events so far

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,479
first at fikkim casa who's a debian or

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,479
stay at home news debian

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,479
a month-long event by the debian brazil

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,439
team where they hosted a different talk

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,680
each night

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,320
and at our first online mini deb conf

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,159
i've also done two interviews recently

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,680
these slides will be made available at

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,840
the end of this talk where you'll be

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
able to find links to all of these

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,360
internally the dpl listens to project

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
members

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,960
now this sounds very passive but

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
actually a lot of

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,079
it's actually a lot of work paying

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,560
attention getting to core

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,080
issues and keeping track of those in

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
order to find solutions

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,319
this takes up a lot of time and i've

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,040
found video calls to be very useful

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,879
for more complicated issues in debian

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,520
the dpl doesn't really have

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,400
much power directly the dpl isn't a

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
dictator

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,239
but the dpl can assign power to teams we

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,000
call these

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,640
delegations the dpl also approves

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,760
budgets

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,800
and individual expenses and works with

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,080
the treasury team

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,160
on finances this isn't an exhaustive

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,319
list on

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,640
functions that the ddpl perform so you

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,519
can find out more information on these

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,599
pages

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,760
i'm also starting i've also started a

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,080
dpl blog recently

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,560
where i plan to post more frequent

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,560
updates

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,080
and onto the topic of finances let's

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
talk a bit about that

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,480
but before we do for some context let's

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,519
watch a quick clip where neil

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,760
a previous dpl gives a recap on finances

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,840
at devconf16

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,280
now just a quick correction the dates

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,720
that he mentioned are actually intended

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,560
to be from 2015

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,360
to 2016. let's watch

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,040
money in my platform i said we have too

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
much money and we should spend it now

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,040
every request that came in i replied and

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,080
said

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,319
spend the money already

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,440
people said can i have 2 000 euros for a

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,560
sprint

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,560
um i said have let's go up to 2500 euros

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,920
because i don't want people coming back

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,440
again and saying oh we went over the

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
budget by 100 euros or so

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,519
did a lot of work with debian system

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,280
administrators as well to

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
get things like new disks improve

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,840
hardware things like this

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,439
so this is just the money at spi um in

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,879
the various earmarks that we have

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,799
and so very priced to say that with this

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,400
great amount of spending that i

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,439
authorized and told everyone to do

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,359
we ended up with more money than we

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,359
started with the game

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,479
oh dear so neil

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,160
if you found those numbers disturbing

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,680
you might want to watch something else

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,360
for the next minute or so our money is

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,479
handled by three different trusted

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
organizations

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,800
namely debian france debian switzerland

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,280
and software in the public interest

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,320
in the u.s a quick note about this deb

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,360
conveyer marks

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,600
they cover debkon 14 to debconf19

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,639
and although deb conf generally results

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,240
in some profit

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,759
these numbers don't reflect the amount

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,080
of profits for debkanth

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,600
since we often get deb confidentials

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,919
into our spi account

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,919
but then spin it again via a local or

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,520
another trusted organization

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
those dead configure marks will likely

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,240
be merged down to debian

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,199
by sbi's next reporting cycle combining

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,840
data from

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,000
their last reporting cycles that totals

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,759
to about

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,199
896 000 u.s dollars

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
but because these numbers are quite

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,880
delayed my estimate

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,000
is that we're closer to about 930 000

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,919
today so

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,440
why is it so difficult for us to spend

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,440
this money is there a problem

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,639
i don't think there's really any problem

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,800
on the incoming side

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,479
we asked for money for hardware and

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,880
we're very happy to have

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,720
basically gotten it twice i think that

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,000
supporters of the project have proven

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,759
over and over again

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,840
that if we ever do need money for

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,759
something they'll be there to help us

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
so thanks again for all the support from

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,759
our sponsors and donors

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,360
when it comes to hardware it turns out

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,960
that putting together a cohesive

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,600
long-term hardware strategy for the

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,919
project

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
turns out to be a lot of work this year

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
covet 19

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
also got in the way with some supply

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,280
chains and getting access to data

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
centers

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,960
the good news is that the sa is

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,680
procuring two new fancy lenovo servers

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,600
right now

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,280
which is a good chunk of money even

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,319
after the good discount that we received

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,479
from them

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,600
of course coveted 19 also got in our way

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,400
of having meetings

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,759
including devconf 20. this is one area

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,080
where we're actually usually good at

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,319
spending money

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,360
debian knights also really don't like

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,360
spending money

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,360
for some reason i've received feedback

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,560
that some people just feel guilty to

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,639
spend debian money

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,960
and will try to avoid it if at all

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,520
possible sometimes it also feels like

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,319
debian developers are people who for

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,479
example

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,319
earn fifty dollars per hour but they'll

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,440
spend five hours to save the project

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,360
ten dollars um that seems a bit

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,560
intuitive for me and since we have

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,479
enough money but

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,560
are always short on time i'd urge

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,319
developers to flip that around

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,160
and rather spend money where it could

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,759
save time where possible

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,720
and there's of course no need to feel

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,800
guilty about doing that

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,240
so some improvements that's planned for

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,479
finances is

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,440
to make more use of delegations to draw

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,360
up budgets

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,120
and approve expenditures currently

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,400
that's how debconf works step conf

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,199
draws up one budget and then the dpl

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,240
doesn't have to

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,120
approve every line item that they spend

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,599
money on

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,800
which makes it easier to spend and also

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,560
decreases paperwork for everybody

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
so we'll have more teams where we do

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,680
that

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,360
i also want to work with hardware

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,199
manufacturers to get preferential

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,160
pricing for debian developers for new

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
hardware

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,960
and we got feedback from hardware

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,120
manufacturers that

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,560
that they want better support on debian

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,319
for new hardware

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,560
and at the same time we have some debian

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,479
developers who are really old hardware

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,800
who can't really afford new ones

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,840
so i'm fine with the project spending

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
money for them for

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,280
new laptops but ideally i'd really want

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,759
to see

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,599
preferential pricing for from any

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,000
hardware manufacturer that

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,919
that wants that and more on that point a

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,160
bit later

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,000
um what i've also been doing as dpl

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,000
since i've been dpl is to meet regularly

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,360
with the debian credit team

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,160
and this week we also met with the spi

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,879
uh for the first time in that call and

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,560
uh

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,720
we're going to continue doing that with

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,360
all teos involved

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,759
to improve our financial practices and

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,680
there's

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,160
there's lots of good ideas there for

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,039
example we want to introduce line item

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,039
reporting

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,760
and do some coordination if we can do

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,719
something like use the same

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,560
category codes across all our teos then

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,680
that makes it real easy to combine these

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,080
reports

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,919
somewhat automatically and put together

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,680
larger reports that

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,440
give more details on what we spend money

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,200
on and

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,720
and have better transparency for our

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,760
project members

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,279
with regards to that also the idea is

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,560
that we show the world that we can and

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,880
do spend our money well

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,680
to make debian better i think one of the

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,760
reasons

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,200
why people like donating money to debian

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,240
is i know it will be

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,839
put to good use and i think we need to

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,080
just to show what we spend money on when

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,519
we do to to show them that

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,360
we're actually spending this to make

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,800
debian better instead of just having

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,040
money that sits in a bank account

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,000
somewhere

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,360
okay on to some project stats thanks to

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
the amazing efforts

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
of many people involved and especially

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,560
to the release team

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
debian has gotten pretty good at

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,360
releasing just about every two years

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,959
since squeeze we also had lts which is

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,360
why those bars have gotten

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,000
more longer in recent years and there's

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,920
also an

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,440
extended long-term support commercial

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,519
offering from frixion

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,760
that's not depicted in this graph of

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,760
course

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,240
and in terms of our membership we have

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,240
1015 current project members

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,480
so that's the uploading and the none

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,720
uploading developers combined

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,839
the debian maintainer project is also

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,040
quite successful

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,640
we currently have 215 dms

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,399
and if you're keeping an eye on the new

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,399
mains list you'll see that they're

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,920
receiving many new applications

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,920
that's a very good sign for the health

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,680
of our community i think this is

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,600
happening in part because our processes

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,760
for this have become so much better

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,519
over the last few years and i'd like to

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,160
especially thank enriquezini

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,720
for his great work on this on that note

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,480
i'd also like to thank our mra team

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
for getting in touch with and tracking

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,279
missing developers who may have either

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,399
retired

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,680
or have unfortunately become deceased so

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,079
many thanks all around so

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,720
in an early debconf there was a buff to

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,880
discuss

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,920
how we're going to have to scale up to

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,720
be able to support

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,120
fifteen thousand packages and then later

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,680
on

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,320
in this screenshot at depconf8 steve was

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,880
dpl

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,839
and in his talk he said i had a quick

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,120
look last night

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,680
and i kind of scared myself for i 386 in

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,800
lenny

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,839
we are currently over 22 000 binary

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,839
packages

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,160
ow so steve

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,800
if those numbers disturbed you i suggest

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,600
you look away for a bit

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,680
so snapshot of unstable i took recently

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,200
had 61 071

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:19,440
binary packages for amd 64 and 31

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,040
723 source packages so it appears that

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,959
we have roughly a ratio

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,399
of 2 to 1 between binary and source

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,760
packages

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,720
so how did we scale to to be able to

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,720
support 15

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,120
000 packages or even the four times as

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,320
much

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,440
that we have now well the answer to that

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,399
is remarkably simple

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,920
and that is that we just didn't sure

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,120
some bottlenecks were pushed to the

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,040
limits and fixed

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,399
and some other things have improved i

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,880
mean at least

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,279
we can do source only uploads now for

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,320
packages already in the archive right

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,160
but i think after boozer is released we

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,720
need to start asking some serious

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,600
questions about 100 000 packages

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,560
because that is a serious reality on the

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,959
horizon

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,320
and we should keep that in mind for

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,880
everything from apt to

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,600
archives and mirrors to our bug tracker

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,920
and

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,800
any other process that might be affected

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,959
by this

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,040
i think at devcon 21 there should

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,839
probably be a session to talk about

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,880
our future and what we can improve to be

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,760
able to support

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,760
100 000 packages in the debian archive

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,800
before moving on from project status i'd

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,600
like to come back to steve's slide one

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,240
more time

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,279
if you look closely on the last line of

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,680
his slide

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,480
he also talked about debian developers

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,079
getting married

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,000
and sometimes even to each other

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,279
and on that note congratulations to

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,600
tammy and voter

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,399
who got married on the 29th of february

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,240
this year

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,720
tammy worked on most of the artwork for

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,399
depconf16 and voter was working on the

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,120
sponsors loop for the video team at the

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
time

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,880
they worked together on that and the

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,120
rest is history what made this wedding

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,120
especially unique and almost surreal

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
was how everyone at the wedding even the

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
old people were really curious about

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,519
debian

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,519
and kept on asking me about it

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,959
now this is where i got pretty good at

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,440
the question so

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,959
what do you do at debian it's a it's

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,120
such a simple question

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,880
but when strangers and especially

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,000
non-technical strangers

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,320
ask us this we're completely stumped and

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,639
providing an answer like oh i maintain a

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,600
few dozen packages and fix some bugs for

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,360
debian live

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,760
and i also do some deadcon stuff etc etc

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,000
wouldn't really mean much to them not

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,800
necessarily depending on what they know

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,800
at the same time if you say something

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,120
like oh it's tough to do with computers

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,079
it's not a very accurate or helpful

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,760
description because

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,680
nearly every job these days has

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,519
something to do with computers

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,160
so by the end of the wedding i got

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,720
i got it refined to oh i'm a volunteer

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,519
there

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,199
and i'm also a project member which

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,920
means that i get to vote on important

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,880
issues

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,160
so that's a very short and also very

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,760
accurate description

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
that would be useful for people who

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,760
actually know what debian is and even if

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,399
they only have a vague

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,399
idea that could help them as well so i

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,920
thought i'd share that just in case

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
you're ever at a debian wedding and

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,880
people keep asking you this

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:28,880
as well so following from the last slide

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,040
i think that it's actually important

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,839
that we start becoming good

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,519
at talking about what debian is and what

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,680
we do inside the project

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,519
um because it's one of the two old

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,240
problems that has been with us for a

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,240
while

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,240
during the early stages of lockedown

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,320
year i started reading some old

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
debian develop threads and there was one

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,720
thread

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
in the late 90s where

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,480
people encouraged bring up debian

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,000
problems not even solutions

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,079
just mention what they think is a

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,199
problem in debian and what's encouraging

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,279
is that most of the

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,240
problems that were big problems in

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,440
debian back then

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,959
have actually been sold but these two

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
issues listed on the screen and that is

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,959
that

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,480
we don't do enough marketing or get

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,560
enough press recognition

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,079
or that debian is not as polished as

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,680
other distributions or even other

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,399
operating systems in terms of look and

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,160
feel

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,639
these problems have come up over and

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,120
over in various ways over the years

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,639
even in many dpl talks i've only had

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,639
screenshots of two of them there but

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,040
there's been more

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,399
so um i think we've actually gotten

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,639
better at those

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,160
but they're maybe not completely solved

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,000
yet so

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,600
we're lucky that our upstreams have

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,920
gotten better at creating

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,680
uis that are more consistent and look

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,720
better and i'm more pleasing and welcome

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,199
for our users

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,880
but i think we can still go a long way

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,079
on building on our wednesday

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,639
and making it even better i'm also glad

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,880
that

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,199
in terms of press at least internally

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,839
we've improved drastically

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,320
i like the work that laura and donald is

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,079
doing

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
with the regular press updates whenever

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,199
something happens in debian

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,040
there's a news entry somewhere and it

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,519
goes on all the social media

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,560
channels and external press entities can

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,639
pick up on that

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,800
that's really fantastic and i think bets

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,320
from debian is also really cool

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,160
it's usually just small snippets of

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,959
things that happens in debian

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,720
and it's just fantastic and i think we

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,199
should continue working on those

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,279
and uh and building on what we have

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,759
there

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,880
so talking more about problems and even

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,040
on a meta level

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,800
i often say that debian is basically a

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,959
bottomless pit of problems

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,800
now this isn't a negative reflection on

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,519
you as a debian developer

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,959
or even on us as a project but it's

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,199
pretty much inherent

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,120
in the type of work that we do if you

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,680
consider the debian gnu linux

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,639
system and the incredible scope that we

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,639
take on

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,639
we're affected by nearly every problem

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,199
that exists in the realm of computer

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,519
science

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,519
to the point where i wonder is there

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,800
actually any problem in computer science

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,000
that doesn't affect us

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,360
in some way if you've got the a-type

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,199
stress persona

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,880
or even if you're a hacker that likes

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,679
understanding things and loves solving

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,679
problems

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,720
you're going to find working in debian

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,360
very rewarding

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,240
and it can become addictive it happens

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,919
often that

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,000
our lives are completely consumed by

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,319
debian which can be fun

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
but it can also be dangerous it's

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,480
important to have something else to go

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,720
to

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,959
when you're having a rough day in debian

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,000
because that will inevitably happen

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,520
at some point in time

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,520
so make sure that you have other hobbies

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,200
too like gardening or playing music

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,039
or whatever it takes just something that

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
makes you happy that you can fall back

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,160
on

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,640
whenever you get a bit tired from debian

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
um

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,320
so don't let debian consume 100 of your

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,919
life

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
it's healthy for you to leave some

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,000
margin for something else

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,720
and in the end what's best for you as a

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,559
contributor is also best for the project

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,799
over the last few months i've also tried

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,200
to calculate how much more volunteers

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,640
we'd actually need to reach our goals to

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,120
the levels we'd want

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,640
and without adding too much stress on

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,200
our current developers

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,240
by my thumb suck estimations i think we

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,240
need if we

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,160
double our capacity we'd already be

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,120
doing great more so than we've ever done

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,120
before

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,160
but at three times we could probably

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
achieve all our goals

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,000
and as individuals be very selective on

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,799
the exact problems we want to be working

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,120
on

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,880
currently too many people keep taking on

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,039
too much responsibility

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,840
because they feel there's no one else

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,160
who can do so

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,080
i think that addressing our diversity

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,679
problems are key to helping us address

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,440
our capacity problems

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,120
and bringing in more women and people

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,679
from all kinds of backgrounds all over

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,679
the world

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,440
will make our projects not only stronger

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,840
but also more resilient

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,360
it bothers me how little local team

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,799
activity we have in africa

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,039
at the same time it's also

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,640
understandable that if on average if

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,640
if someone has to work longer hours to

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,320
be able to put food on their table

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,160
that they'll have less time to work for

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,480
free on a software project

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,000
at the same time we are seeing growth in

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,880
some areas of free software on the

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,799
continent

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
python for example is becoming

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,480
incredibly popular and

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,080
more and more pycon events are happening

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,400
all over the place

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,720
i would really love to see many devcons

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,799
florists like that in africa too

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,880
on that note many debcons have been

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,640
growing very steadily and this year was

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,080
going to be by far our best mini

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,880
debconfear in debian

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,760
before covet 19 came along i mentioned

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,679
africa but

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,200
i think we should work on other parts of

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,840
the world that are problematic too of

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,919
course

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,240
um i think it's bizarre that there's

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,720
never been a mini deb conf in the us

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,000
and we have lots of users there so

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,240
clearly we have a lot of work to do

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,559
then on the topic of black lives matter

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,480
a bunch of us got together

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,640
to put together a statement on behalf of

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,559
the project it turned out to be

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,679
embarrassingly difficult for us to do to

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,000
get that

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,480
to reality we didn't want to just put

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,320
out some carbon copy statements that

00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,919
just wanted to grab some of attention

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,000
for marketing purposes

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,919
but we wanted to put something out with

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,320
real action and purpose behind it

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,960
something concrete unfortunately we

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,960
failed

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,240
and i want to apologize to everyone who

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,159
was involved with that

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,840
that we didn't manage to carry those

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,400
intentions out to reality

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,200
in a timely fashion but i also want to

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,760
state that

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,679
it's not too late and regardless of what

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,480
happens in politics and in media around

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,159
the world

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,159
that we can continue to further the

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,320
cause of equality within debian

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,480
and be part of the solution rather than

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,640
the problem

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,240
during recent discussions some people

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,679
have pointed out that

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,840
some of the mentorship programs we

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,320
contribute to are quite expensive

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,640
and they're right but those programs are

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,400
also pretty much all we have right now

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,559
and the feedback we have from those are

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,799
very positive so at least for the

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,760
immediate future we're going to continue

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,080
doing them

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,400
but i do think that we have a

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,640
responsibility to look at all the easy

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,880
and cheap ways we can improve mentorship

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,960
and knowledge sharing too

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,640
if for example a woman or anyone else

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,600
for that matter but let's work in a

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,960
context of

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,799
getting more women involved in the

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,960
project and if a woman spends

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,880
just a day installing debian learn how

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
to install and remove packages

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,360
and some basic system configuration

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,200
she'll already have useful skills

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,480
that she could transfer to someone who

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,720
has zero days

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,240
worth of experience with debian i think

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,919
if we're willing to spend some time and

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,159
money on meetups

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,840
for debian women across the world it

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,559
will very quickly get to a point

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,640
where it can snowball and grow on its

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,720
own

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,720
on that note i think we can also do

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,320
better when it comes to onboarding

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,000
the new maintainer guide introduces

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,720
someone to packaging tools in great

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,559
detail

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,799
but i think we should have a similar

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,880
guide that introduces new members to all

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,280
the different tools we use in debian

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,880
even just two or three pages on every

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,559
topic should be plenty enough

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,799
if someone is more interested in more

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,400
details they can also reference it

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,120
through other documentation that's

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,600
already available

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,360
so our problems extend even way beyond

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,840
the scope of all the problems

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,520
in computer science as if we didn't

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,559
already have enough to deal with on a

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,159
technical level

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,880
we also get to deal with many of the

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,799
problems that exists in society

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,480
but that doesn't at all mean that we

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,159
should give up on either count

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,880
we're one of the biggest groups of

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,320
problem solvers that exist

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,280
so what can we do to fix all these

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,919
problems

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,159
we could spend many hours on each topic

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,240
but i'd like to propose an old idea

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,000
that i think we could all work together

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,360
on to forward our cause

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,600
on all fronts and that is to invest more

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:44,080
in local teams what makes local teams

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,320
so great well local teams have been a

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,880
powerful force in building our community

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,720
already every debconf happened because a

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,799
group of locals decided to take

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,080
the big step of preparing a bid for

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,080
their city

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,400
and many of the people in our project

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,880
who are minorities within the project

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,520
got involved because of a local debian

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,200
event

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,799
in which every format may have taken

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,280
place

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,320
by hosting the type of events that local

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,320
teams do

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,320
they lower the barrier of entry to the

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,919
project and at the same time they also

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
make debian better

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,960
and they create excitement around debian

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,080
that attracts more users

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,559
and developers alike now more users

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,679
often sound like that will add more

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,840
support requests

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,360
but local teams also help deal with that

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,520
and at the same time

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,919
at least some percent of our users end

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,840
up becoming debian developers as well

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,600
local teams have also resulted in the

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,840
existence of our top two

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,679
debian specific trusted organizations

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,640
namely debian france and debian

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,120
switzerland

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,080
in some cases like in france taiwan and

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,080
brazil

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,360
local teams have managed managed to

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,679
create local events

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,559
that had even more attendees than

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,640
debconf typically has

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,159
local teams used to be a big thing in

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,760
ubuntu a few years ago

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,600
this was also back when they ran the

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,000
shepherd campaign where individuals and

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,240
local teams got free ubuntu cds

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,240
i personally handed out more than 2 000

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,360
ubuntu cds to individuals

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,799
that is not boxes of ubuntu cds but each

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,640
of them to an individual

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,320
there were boxes on top of that too but

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,600
that would bring it into

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,159
even more thousands this really helped

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,240
boost ubuntu under grassroots level the

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,120
idea that they had all these free cds

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,279
to distribute um this picture is from a

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,880
software freedom day in storefest that i

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,039
organized in kailicha

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,000
which is one of the poor areas in cape

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,320
town this

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,960
young child had just come from a dancing

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,039
event close by and was so excited about

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,400
the ideas behind ubuntu that i explained

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,799
to him that

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,760
i ended up taking a picture of him with

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,919
a disc

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,559
it's kind of crazy to think that he must

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,240
be in his early 20s by now

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,840
and i'm not suggesting that we start

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,159
printing installation media

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,440
but we should do more to allow our users

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,840
to promote debian

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,960
rather than just depending on our

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,120
project members to do so

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,159
so here's a few thoughts i have on how

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,320
we can fortify

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,320
our local teams we could have a team

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,880
delegation that takes care of a global

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,960
budget

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,000
and could take care of reimbursement

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,840
process

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and request that fits inside those

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,000
budgets we do something similar for deb

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,600
conf where deb kind of submits a budget

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,840
and then they're responsible for the

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,840
details afterwards once it's approved

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,440
so not the whole team would need to be

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,480
part of the delegation

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,159
but a delegation would be useful for

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,039
those who are taking care of financial

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,039
stuff

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,960
members of a local team support group

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,919
that focuses on things like creating

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,039
t-shirts

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,840
pamphlets posters usb disks and so on

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,679
would not have to be delegated then one

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,840
thing that the debian derivatives

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,760
team does which is pretty great is to

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,240
run a census of derivatives

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,960
i think it would be great to borrow that

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,600
idea

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,360
and have at least an annual check-in

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,440
with local teams to check if they're

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,559
still up and running and whether they

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,640
need any help

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,520
and whether all the details we have for

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,640
them on file are still up to date

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,120
i wrote here establish a process for

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,320
starting up a local team but really i

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,120
think that's also

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,760
more of a handholding process to help

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,320
them

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,880
um feel that there's some way that will

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,200
guide them

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,559
and help them if they get stuck and not

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,400
that and that they have a feeling that

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,400
they're not alone in this

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,559
but some checklists and things like that

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,360
will also be useful

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,880
and then schedule coordinated events i

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,520
mentioned software freedom day

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,279
in the previous slide this used to be an

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,919
event that ran a while back

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,880
where people hosted in store fests and

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,720
similar

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,799
linux events all over the world on the

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,120
same day every year

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,799
and we can use events like debian day

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,840
like this which happened just a bit more

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,760
than a week ago

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,760
i know that the debian brazil team took

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,480
advantage of that and possibly others

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,480
too

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,480
but with some planning and coordination

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,960
i think we can make a bigger deal

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,960
out of that kind of event across the

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,039
world

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,039
but those are just my thoughts bring

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,279
your expertise to the local team buff

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,279
hosted by moria and myself on saturday

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,279
especially if you have experience in a

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,480
local team

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,600
so let's talk about linux and oem

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,320
laptops

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,000
so the dell xps range shipped with

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,480
ubuntu for a while now

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,559
and lenovo has been expanding linux

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,840
options across their product range

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,960
so at my first talk as dpl at fikimkasa

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,960
who's a debian

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,000
i dived into the topic a bit and

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,559
pondered on

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,520
what would it take to get debian on oem

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,679
laptops

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,440
also would we even want such a thing

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,600
because i'd imagine that

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,640
most debian users even if they got

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,799
debian on the laptop

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,000
out of the box would probably install

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,120
debian from scratch

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
again the first time the system boots up

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,039
in a nutshell i listed three things

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,679
three main things

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,640
that i thought we'd have to get right to

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,960
get debian

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,200
in shape for an oem install and even

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,080
though i thought that om support might

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,559
not be very high very high priority for

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,960
us

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,640
as individuals i do think it's important

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,840
for us to support the features

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,320
that make it possible even for use cases

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,640
like

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,399
refurb centers who often have struggle

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,720
with software licensing

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,679
debian would be a good option for them

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,480
to install in an oem mode

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,399
so the three main things i mentioned was

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,760
have some support channel available for

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,440
oem laptops

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,360
and this could be something as simple as

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,559
a web page that

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,960
that lists where to download

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,080
installation media how to install it

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,320
and maybe some possible gotchas

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,320
it's also probably somewhat important

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,960
that if someone chooses debian for their

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,360
os

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,960
when ordering a new laptop that they at

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,000
least have some basic understanding of

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,600
what debian is

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,559
and that they're getting a community

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,799
supported system

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,399
then on the technical side i listed that

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,200
we probably need an oem

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,200
mode for our installer and probably

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,000
support for setting up a recovery

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
partition

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,440
since most laptops don't ship with an

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,440
installation media these days

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,440
so in june the linux technical lead at

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,440
lenovo for the pc team

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,640
mark reached out on our list and we

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,880
started chatting

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,679
i pointed them to my previous talk and

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,919
it turns out

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,520
that the points i listed was good but

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,600
not all that critical

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,520
so while support is a concern their

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,000
internal support team can handle linux

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,000
queries

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,600
quite well and it's not really that big

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,320
of an issue

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,640
a recovery partition would also be nice

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,399
but

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,760
currently other linux systems don't do

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,880
that yet either

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,080
and this isn't that big a deal the

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,159
important part is really

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,120
hardware enablement and when it comes to

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,880
hardware support

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,960
they care about the latest and greatest

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,320
models because you know the models that

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,360
we often use

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,760
just aren't on sale anymore

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,840
so we ended up having a good discussion

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,480
and lenovo seems quite enthusiastic to

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,240
improve hardware support in debian

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,919
and mark even expressed an interest in

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,159
becoming a debian developer

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,159
which is fantastic if we get more people

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,880
from hardware manufacturers involved in

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,720
debian

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,640
we can reduce a lot of friction for

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,000
everyone from the manufacturer to the

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,760
end user

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
we have some debian developers who are

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,679
still using some really old laptops

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,360
which sometimes get in the way of them

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,360
being productive and

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,200
i thought that perhaps we can get some

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,919
new laptops into the project

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,840
which of course wouldn't just be lenovo

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,799
specific but the idea is that we get new

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,799
hardware for

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,399
our developers which help them and at

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,480
the same time we improve

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,679
hardware support for everyone else as

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,440
well

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,120
so i expressed my concern to mark that

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,679
that it's probably sub-optimal for dd's

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,360
to pay full retail price for new laptops

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,360
especially when we want to try to help

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,799
out them as well and he actually took

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,200
that up with management

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,320
and guess what they agreed so lenovo is

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,000
announcing this week

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,840
and i've permission to say that in this

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,120
talk that they'll be providing a

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,720
significant discount

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,120
on all new hardware to all debian

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
developers so keep an eye out for

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,399
that announcement if you're interested

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,240
in a new machine

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,600
and on saturday there's a session called

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,440
lenovo and debian

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,880
if you're interested in improving your

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,880
hardware support on debian

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,399
or if you want to share ideas and on how

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,399
we can collaborate better

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,840
or if you'd like to ask lenovo any other

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,600
questions on this topic

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,080
then this will be a good place to do so

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,320
so i've covered quite a few bits today

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,799
and while we are certainly not perfect

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,399
we also have a lot to be proud of we're

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,279
one of the few distributions that do

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,120
what we do

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,039
underscale and pass all the same

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,679
freedoms we get from the software

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,519
onto our users in the commercial world

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,399
there's often a challenge between

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,120
developers and users in our case demand

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,799
developers are usually debian users too

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,720
so the conflict of interest that usually

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,760
exists between users and developers in a

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,799
commercial world

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,200
just really doesn't exist in debian

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,799
our project is also quite healthy and is

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,880
continuing to thrive

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,320
it's great that we never have to make

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
poor short-term decisions

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,679
to justify short-term profits i

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,320
mentioned running costs

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,720
too because one of the upstreams have

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,279
become

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,960
quite bloated in that regard and it

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,440
really didn't work out

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,519
finally we basically keep on chugging

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,919
along and keep releasing debian and with

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,760
that

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,440
we continue to improve in just about

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,120
every direction

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,559
we're a strong force in a free software

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,480
movement and

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,559
if you're new to debian and unsure how

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,760
to get involved my advice is just to

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,600
keep on using debian

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,200
and find things that you are unhappy

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,279
with and it can be better

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,640
scratching your own edge is often a good

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,720
way to get involved in the project

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,320
and that's it from me if we're running

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,840
on time then there should still be a few

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,840
minutes left for questions

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:53,919
thanks jonathan for the amazing talk

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:57,120
uh let's move on to the q a session

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,679
we have quite a few questions so

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,880
let's start with the first so the

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,600
question says

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,720
what about spending more money for

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,840
non-developers

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,960
as developers do not need money to do

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,240
their job

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,760
so jonathan let me just read the

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,120
question again what about spending more

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,399
money for non-developers

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,720
as developers do not i don't know i

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,200
think

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,159
it's a case by case basis so if someone

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,399
has an idea

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,919
i think don't hesitate to to email

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,080
leader at dpl

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,519
leader at debian.org with your idea to

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,960
spend money i think

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,039
there's many areas probably as

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,679
non-developers where

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,399
it's a good idea to spend some money so

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,320
let's see

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,799
if we can look at it by case by case

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,559
basis i think on a long term we can

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,159
use that to build up a policy based on

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,799
that and we can always ask for more

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,559
input once we have a policy

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,559
oh that's great so let's move on to the

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,799
second question that says

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,880
uh debian maintainers and debian

00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,159
developer application process

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,480
requires pgp key signing uh so

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,000
how do you how do we do this in the

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,760
kovite 19 world

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,519
are we concerned about the drop in

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,320
application numbers

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,760
so so damn recently raised this on i

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,599
think either the debian project or the

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,320
debian devel mailing list

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,480
um and that the idea was to make it

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,000
clear to debian developers that they can

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,919
use their own discretion

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,440
and in certain cases you can you can

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,760
come up with your own way to make sure

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,000
that

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,359
the person whose key you sign is

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,320
actually trusted

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,079
um and the idea is to make sure that

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,599
that person is the same person

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,760
that you communicate with again in the

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,760
future once you've signed that key

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,679
um so it is possible to do something

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,240
like for example i'm going to sign

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,399
someone

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,280
someone's keys over jet c uh someone who

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,960
i've worked with

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,639
a lot so i know what it looks like but

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,079
we can't meet in person so we're just

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,200
going to exchange keys

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,240
like we would have in real life

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,320
emergency session now someone asked what

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,440
what benefit is there in having even a

00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,520
jet season

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,200
um it it's just it just makes it a

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,079
little bit i just feel as a debian

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,920
developer

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,280
it's a bit harder for someone to create

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,280
sock puppet accounts

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,480
um when i can actually see them and

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,480
interact with them for a bit

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,000
so moving on to the next question it

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,400
says uh

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,960
do you think the process for becoming a

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,480
debian maintainer is not very simplified

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,359
as such

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,079
um it can probably still be simplified a

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,560
lot

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,320
but i think it has become a lot more

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,079
simplified than it has been

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,359
a few years ago and i think that's a

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,800
great thing we can see that in the

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,280
amount of increases

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,119
in new applicants that have come in so i

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,760
think the more it gets simplified the

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,839
more

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,280
um applicants will even still see after

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,880
that

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,520
so true so next we have a very personal

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,320
question

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,400
so it says will you stand again as the

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,119
dpl next year

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,839
i want to so um if my personal situation

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,839
allows it

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,839
i probably will we'll see

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:07,040
okay so

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,920
next we have so i think you have

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,960
answered the question here

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,320
and uh next so

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,880
uh another question says uh

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,320
is there a plan by the publicity team to

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,560
get paid help

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,960
for instance from designers to improve

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,440
our communication materials

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:32,320
uh should this be something we encourage

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,520
so i think in that case i'll take the

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,880
lazy option

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,960
and once we have a delegation for local

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,240
teams i'll push that onto being

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,240
their their choice to make and uh

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,680
again i think we'll probably need a good

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,760
policy around that

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,880
the thing is we want to be true to the

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,560
nature of being

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,880
volunteers in the project and we don't

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,079
want we don't want someone who gets paid

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,240
to do something

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,400
have a higher status than someone who's

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,119
not paid and kind of shoving them to the

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,599
side

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,839
so i think whenever we bring money into

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,000
something and paying someone

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,000
um we have to be careful of that balance

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,359
and making sure that we don't get

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,480
compromised on that uh so i forgot to

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,599
add it says that

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
salsa debian flyers are pretty dated

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,000
also

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,000
so just to add to the question

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,160
so now we have a pretty long question i

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,280
think we have time for that

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,800
also so it says uh

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,760
oh sorry it just scrolled down it says

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,000
uh the debian new queue reached all-time

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,200
high

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,880
at the package count earlier this year

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,440
but saw a huge drop around early july

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,119
this has unblocked countless important

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,839
updates from golang and the rust

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,920
packages

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,520
which are impacted by the bottleneck

00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,720
significantly

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,160
so it's been asked what's your take on

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,400
the situation

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,800
and in your opinion what would it take

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,040
to significantly reduce this barrier to

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,880
avoid frustrations and scale up

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:10,079
developer activities so how you can

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,480
assist the dds it says

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,079
so the new queue is a saw point for all

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,800
of us because it's not only

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,119
new packages that land in a new queue if

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,599
you

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,520
do like an api bump and your your

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,800
library your binary package for your

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,920
library has to bump um it it will also

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,920
go through new again

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,119
and it's kind of a pain point for us and

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,240
many packages have

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,680
gotten stuck there for a long time and

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,040
it was at an all-time high at the

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
beginning of this year and then it

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,839
dropped

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,920
shortly afterwards now the reason for

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,680
that drop is because

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,680
there was a bunch of people who wanted

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,520
to get involved in ftp team

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,880
and contribute but there was also

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,440
bottleneck in getting those people

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,640
trained

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,040
and actually getting them to be

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,400
productive members of the team

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,800
now sean witton has gotten involved with

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,480
the ftp team and he's done a great job

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,320
of rounding these people up

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,880
and getting them the access rights they

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,920
need uh training them to

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,520
to do the actual work and that's that's

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,960
been fantastic that's why there was such

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,920
a big drop so i think as long as that

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,880
continues

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,280
um things will just get better and i'm

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,200
also

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,560
thank you to sean witton for taking that

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,960
on because i think

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:24,240
that was quite a nice thing to do

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,520
that answers uh so i guess

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,760
we have one more question coming which

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,119
says

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,480
uh did somebody say blue voltage

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,440
this year or maybe we can wait for the

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,320
question

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,000
um it says did somebody see his blue

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,920
voltage this year and i just

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,400
missed it so at previous dev curves i

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,520
did

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,200
change my nic on irc to blue voltage so

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,240
this year i haven't gotten to that yet

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,400
maybe i should

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,000
um i wish my hair was as awesome as

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,000
moga's hair i don't know if you saw

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,839
that in their talk this morning but her

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,240
hair is a very good shade of blue

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,880
but i couldn't find that at my local

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,599
stores

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,599
in time for them

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,720
so it says thank you for the talk and

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,400
great work

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,040
as the dpl uh so uh

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,560
we got a few minutes any final thoughts

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,960
you want to add

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,400
before ending this talk nope just

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,720

just go on and baby i'll do that

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,800
that's true so let's uh conclude this

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,359
talk

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,079
