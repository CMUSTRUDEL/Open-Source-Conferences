On July 18th Stretch LTS starts, offering two more years of security support to the Debian Stretch release. Stretch LTS will be the fourth iteration of LTS, following Squeeze LTS which started in 2014, Wheezy LTS in 2016, and Jessie LTS in 2018.

The LTS team would like to gather together to discuss the work theyâ€™ve done so far and the work that needs to be done for the upcoming years, areas that could be improved upon, and potentially discussing the feedback that we've got from the LTS survey!
