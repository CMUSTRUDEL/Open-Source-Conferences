The Linux kernel has a very active development community, constantly adding not only new hardware support but new features. Some of these features can simply be enabled by the configuration in the Debian package, but some also require support from other user-space packages. This talk will cover some of the more interesting changes made in the past year, and any work thatâ€™s still needed to support these in Debian.
