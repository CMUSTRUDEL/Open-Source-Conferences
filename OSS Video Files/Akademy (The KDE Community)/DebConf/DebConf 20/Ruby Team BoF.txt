Like previous years, the Debian Ruby team would gather together to discuss the work they've done so far and the work that needs to be done for Ruby 3.0.

Besides that, this meeting will be used to discuss other activities that are going within the team, like new workflows, what's working and what's not, etcetera.

And lastly, we'd decide the logistics of the next possible sprints :)
