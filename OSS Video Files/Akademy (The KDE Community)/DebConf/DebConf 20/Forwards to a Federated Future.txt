Federated social networks are a user-centered alternative to the
centralized, data-collection based ones everybody knows.

From their beginnings as a place to talk about federated social networks,
they have now grown into a rich environment 

And thanks to the efforts of the DebianSocial team, Debian contributors can
find a home on the Fediverse to share what they're doing in the project and
to showcase their work, collaborate with others and share knowledge.

This talk will start with a presentation about the federated social
networks, what they look like today and why they are important and relevant
to the Debian community, and will continue with a presentation of the work
of the DebianSocial team.
