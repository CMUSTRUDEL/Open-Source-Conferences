Marga has been working in the Linux industry for over 15 years. On top of being a Debian Developer, she was the co-head of IT of a company in Argentina that migrated from Windows to Debian, she was an engineer in the team that maintained the internal Linux distribution at Google, and she's now working on Flatcar Container Linux (a successor to CoreOS), which is a container-optimized Linux distribution.

Each of these roles has brought on different challenges, and has meant applying different approaches to getting the results that most closely reflects user's expectations.

This talk will explore these challenges, discuss how some approaches can serve on one problem-domain but not another and look into the future to try to figure out the relevance of the OS in the coming years.
