Every computer needs power; much of the Earth is
bombarded with power for significant parts of every day! What a useful
cooincidence!

I'd like to share my experiences moving my office to mostly using
solar power, sparks and all!

I'll go over the various components, including some of the free software and open
hardware projects used in the system, give thanks to community members
who helped, and delve into my future schemes for going further
off-grid.
