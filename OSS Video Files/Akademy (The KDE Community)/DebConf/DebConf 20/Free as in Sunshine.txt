Every computer needs power; much of the Earth is
bombarded with power for significant parts of every day! What a useful
cooincidence!

I'd like to share my experiences moving my office to mostly using
solar power, sparks and all!

I'll go over the various components, including some of the free software and open
hardware projects used in the system, give thanks to community members
who helped, and delve into my future schemes for going further
off-grid.

	00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,519
hello my name is vegan cascadian and i

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,799
will be presenting

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,320
free as in sunshine

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,439
so this story goes back uh back to

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,080
about five years now i

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,519
had a limited amount of space uh where i

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,519
was living

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,359
and i needed an office so

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,880
after looking around for a while we

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,840
rolled a small building

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,840
into the backyard

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,800
and i talked to a friend

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,440
that i'd run into over the years about

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,840
going with solar

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,239
this person was scott johnson who works

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,520
on a project called solar net one

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,280
and uh he deploys

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,480
uh small off-grid schools uh

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,039
on remote islands uh had used

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,760
technology that i had worked on in wn

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,920
for many years called ltsp

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,720
and uh at that at that time back in 2015

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
he was exploring switching all of the

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,720
systems over to arm as

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,840
i understand it so we cross paths again

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,040
because i also work on arm and debian

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,840
so he pointed me to a

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,159
kickstarter project uh put on by

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,759
electrodecus

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,920
and this project was for a

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,040
battery management controller for solar

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,079
systems

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,040
and one of its most uh

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,079
main features was that it supported a

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,799
relatively new

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,600
form of battery chemistry called lithium

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,079
iron phosphate

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,520
lithium iron phosphate has some really

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,240
interesting advantages

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,360
in particular it has a very long life

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,680
cycle

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,439
uh when i mean very long life cycle i

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,439
mean as compared to

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,439
lead acid batteries where you might get

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,399
five or six years out of them

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,759
we're looking at more like 10 15 20

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,319
years of life cycle

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,319
out of a lithium iron phosphate battery

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:15,120
so that's pretty exciting for a system

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,280
you can also use almost the full

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,480
capacity of the battery without

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
really damaging it lead acid batteries

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,879
you really don't want to drop

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
below 50 so effectively a lead acid

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,160
battery

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,440
is roughly half the capacity it's

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,280
advertised at

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,040
whereas with the lithium-ion phosphate

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,840
battery you can arguably

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,080
do many many relatively deep cycle

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,560
discharges without serious damage to the

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
battery

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,800
uh probably one of the most exciting

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,080
things about lithium iron phosphate

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,800
is they are extremely safe unlike

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
other lithium chemistries they're very

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,959
stable they're not

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,080
prone to overheating or a

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,080
chemical thermal runaway cycle which

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,680
could lead to very dangerous things i

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
don't know if you recall

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,920
some years back a number of phones had

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,920
recalls on them because they

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,920
started catching fire and lithium iron

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,879
phosphate are very unlikely to catch

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,720
fire this is

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,840
perhaps one of the most exciting

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,400
features of this new technology for me

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
and they can also be safely kept indoors

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,159
unlike lead acid batteries which

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,480
off gas certain materials certain

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,360
chemicals that you really don't want to

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,120
be breathing

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,840
and are dangerous to living things

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,680
but they come with some disadvantages

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,640
you can't have everything for free

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,840
and probably the most noticeable one is

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
how much more expensive

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,480
they seem to be some of these are

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,519
mitigated by the long life expectancy of

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,080
the battery

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,959
and uh and the fact that you can

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,280
actually use

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,959
more of the full capacity without fear

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,480
of damaging your batteries but it's

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,760
still a pretty significant

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,239
uh thing to consider they're also a

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
little bit

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,920
larger than some other lithium

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
chemistries

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,120
i forget how they compare to lead acid

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,439
but

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,120
the energy density is a little bit lower

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,160
but for my application

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,359
of a fairly stable not particularly

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,919
mobile thing

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,160
it's pretty good so that mitigates that

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,240
disadvantage

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,120
um and there are some rare materials

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,160
used in just about any battery chemistry

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,199
these days so that that was

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,720
brought up to me um i think by joey hess

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,840
but i had already uh gone

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,479
hog wild on this battery plan so i was

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,520
going to run forward even though rare

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,800
material mining

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,000
is is a bit concerning so i got on the

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,880
kickstarter

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,360
and i ordered it and it arrived in

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,639
2016. i had my very own

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,520
battery management controller i uh

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,639
i had big dreams ahead i had really big

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,000
dreams ahead

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,199
i was planning um i could probably

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,800
fit somewhere between four and fives

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,000
uh large scale large

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,120
24 volt solar panels on the roof

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,360
um so i was figuring why don't i go try

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,479
to max this system out it can handle

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
you know one 1.8 kilowatts of solar

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,400
panels

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,199
so i may as well fill it out uh the

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,240
panels are

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,800
relatively cheap all things considered

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,120
and in order to use all those panels you

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,320
need a very large battery

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,600
so i held on to these dreams

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,160
but that basically meant that it was

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,919
back burnered for many many years

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,280
i was sitting on this idea and i

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,240
couldn't really i never quite had enough

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,319
funds to get all the various parts

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
in particular the battery would cost

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,160
around 2000

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,039
plus us dollars the solar panels another

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,240
1 000

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,120
almost two thousand dollars i would need

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,639
like a

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,120
relatively expensive inverter

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,319
and what really terrified me was putting

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,319
holes in the roof

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:23,600
um i live in uh portland oregon uh

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,639
where roughly nine months out of every

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
year it rains

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,280
almost every day so holes in the roof is

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,319
something that

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,440
kind of terrified me and so all of these

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,319
you know economic and just not wanting

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,919
water falling on my head in my office

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,600
factors led me to back burner this

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,080
project

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:51,199
but in late 2019 just last year

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,080
i had an idea why don't i build a much

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,639
smaller system use smaller 12 volt

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,360
panels

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,000
rather than 24 volt panels they can they

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,440
can

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,160
they're physically smaller and so that

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,280
gave me more

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,400
options of how to mount them

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,560
a smaller 12-volt battery that really

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,680
took a huge reduction on the cost of the

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,199
system

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,759
and made it a lot more feasible for me

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,520
and of course a smaller inverter as well

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,960
so

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,520
and this plan involved no holes in the

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,880
roof

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,000
uh i was hoping to just bolt them to the

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,479
side and just get

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,639
something anything going even though

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,360
bolting the panels to the side of the

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,280
tiny house

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,240
would would result in sub-optimal

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,199
performance

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,160
but i had really sub-optimal performance

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,440
with actually

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,440
zero watt hours coming in so i decided

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,800
to move forward with this plan

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,960
and uh i started going crazy online

00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:01,360
and ordering parts they started arriving

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,440
and i started hemming and hauling about

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,560
really i should go with a 24 volt

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,639
battery uh

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,560
notably because a it does mean i

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,800
basically have twice as much storage

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,800
capacity it's a

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,720
the battery is twice as expensive but i

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,120
was going with a small battery to begin

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,240
with

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,319
and i did some numbers it didn't seem

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,599
like my little 12 volt battery was

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,199
really gonna do

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,919
so i ordered more battery cells

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
and then i needed 24 volt to 12 volt

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,440
parts

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:38,560
so i ordered those and they arrived

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,560
and they sat there because

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,640
i still had some work to do ahead of me

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,240
but the first thing i really ended up

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,480
doing on this project

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,800
uh where i actually did something

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,080
practical was i used the old 12 volt

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,120
system

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,240
and i hooked it up to a dc to dc atx

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,959
power supply

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,120
and that gave me some regulated 5 volt

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,120
and 12 volt output

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,000
and i hooked it into the existing 12

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,040
volt system which had a very old battery

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,160
but i effectively started operating on

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,720
a ups for parts of my system

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,640
notably the networking uh some of my

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,200
laptops could run off of this

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
uh some of the arm laptops which can run

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,399
off of 5 volt

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,320
and that was the first uh practical

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,959
thing i did on my solar project it

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,480
involved

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:33,680
no actual solar power

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,760
but uh so what was the real blocker

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,360
on actually getting all the solar setup

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,680
i had all the parts i had

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,800
panels and it really came down to

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,080
i needed to solder some connectors

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,959
onto the battery and so some local

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,920
friends of mine

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,320
keith packard and bart massey came over

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,440
and

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,880
lended me their skills and bart ran off

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,080
and got a butane

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,320
torch because the connectors we had were

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,160
pretty impressive and just using a

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,440
typical soldering iron wouldn't wouldn't

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,480
really hold up to the task and

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,600
they helped me get the first part set up

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,320
so once i had all those connected i

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
could then

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,720
add all the various parts so uh in the

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,839
picture you see there

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,360
the uh the red dots are

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,399
all the positive terminals

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,000
on the battery and there are black dots

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,040
on there as well which maybe are a

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,079
little bit hard to see

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,399
but each of those is one cell so

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,279
my original 12 volt batteries only had

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,200
four of those

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,880
and i just ordered four more to upgrade

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,800
to 24 volt

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,800
and then we've got a circuit breaker

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,959
and of course the battery management

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,079
itself in the

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,079
lower left corner there

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,440
so those were all relatively easy to

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,920
hook up

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,640
and then i had to run off for a

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,959
conference

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,000
the last conference i've physically been

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,200
to in quite some time

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,320
and still i still had

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,560
uh i still was like blocked like how am

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,399
i going to mount these panels

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,880
like where am i going to put like it

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,600
can't i mean yes i can just bolt them to

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,360
the side

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,480
but exactly how you poke holes in a nice

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,440
structure is a bit concerning so i still

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,800
had a blocker

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,279
but uh dlip pointed out

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,000
that i could use the old chicken coop we

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,440
had and i just bolted two of the panels

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,720
onto that

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,920
that worked out quite nicely so

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,519
i uh i got that up and running and

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,600
before too long

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,560
i had collected a 100 watt hours of

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,959
power

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,760
so i was pretty excited about that and i

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,880
got the battery up to 59

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,959
and uh this was maybe

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
i'm forgetting if it was i think it was

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,480
mid april

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,600
i started collecting power we got it up

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,839
to a hundred percent

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,200
and before too long i'm like okay i'm

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,720
gonna connect the other bat

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,959
of the other solar panels and so i had

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,160
an

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,760
old an old pick a fence from a neighbor

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,680
that they had torn down and i just

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,480
bolted some panels to that

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,800
stuck them on the ground and while the

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,399
ground level solar gain wasn't much it

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,440
was a lot more than

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,720
sitting in cardboard boxes in my in my

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,120
office

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,880
so i got i freed up some space in my

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,040
office and started generating some

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,519
serious power

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,800
so how does deviant play into all this

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,440
well other than the

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,360
scott uh johnson from solar net one

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
having used debian on all these remote

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,360
islands being

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,560
what led me to this whole project i

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,040
i've started set up a little uh arm

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,200
board

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,560
running debian that downloads and

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,839
processes the data

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,200
from my solar panels

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,560
and uh this is used to produce

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,000
a rainbow squiggly line graph

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,040
um so here you can see this is

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,240
a pretty nice sunny day for me i was

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,360
getting about

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,079
250 watts at the peak and

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,240
you can see some dips and sways there

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,120
i'll get to some more of this later

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,399
but so how exactly did i get the data

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,360
out of there

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,200
well uh there's a wi-fi connection that

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
that little board connects to

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,399
so this little board connects to wi-fi

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,600
on the battery management controller

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,440
and then it downloads some data

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,160
that looks a bit like this so uh

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,199
i don't know to the human eye that

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,240
doesn't look very

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,360
readable as far as data goes so uh

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,240
there was a javascript page that

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,800
the um electrodecas produced that you

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,600
could use

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,639
to produce probably a prettier graph

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,519
than my graph

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,800
but uh i decided to rewrite this in a

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,920
little bit of python

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,880
uh this this function is more or less a

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,680
rough

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,440
pretty much just directly pythonized

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,399
version of the javascript version

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,279
that deciphers this and so you have the

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,399
data is in various columns

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,000
and uh you use this it i think it uses

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,120
unicode code points

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,360
basically to derive numbers out of uh

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,760
it's like a base91 encryption scheme

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,920
so i managed to figure out how to use

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,760
that data and one of the really annoying

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,240
things if you look in that data there

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,279
are

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,920
there are like four backslashes

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,000
and it took me forever to figure out why

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,600
my data was always going crazy and

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,680
that's because they're escaped

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,160
backslashes and i really need to process

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,560
them as single backslashes

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,240
uh so that took me a while to figure out

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,519
but it was very exciting once i did

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,519
um so i have like multiple competing

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,519
solar projects going on here

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,279
uh when i set up that second array of

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,760
panels i also planted

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:11,040
a bunch of sunchokes and they grew

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,600
very tall in just a few months i think i

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,199
installed these sunchokes before i

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,800
actually installed the second array of

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,320
panels

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,600
and they're they're they're providing

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,680
a wonderful shade but

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,160
later in the day they end up shading the

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,079
panels so i've made sure to like kind of

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,079
push them off to the side there

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,639
and so this is this is where i really

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,480
want to focus on

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:43,920
how in projects you can have

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,639
different types of solar

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,079
solar solar photovoltaics are only one

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,600
kind of solar

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:54,720
i think uh some simple technologies like

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,680
the efficiency of plants these these

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,920
plants produce

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,360
food and they provide shade which

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,399
dramatically

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,839
keep the cooling on the house down

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,680
so that that basically was just one

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,000
point i wanted to point out i have some

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,480
other

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,480
ideas

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,519
uh here's just sort of a a bunch of the

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,720
different other components

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,600
i eventually upgraded the ac inverter on

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,880
the right there

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,120
i i ended up getting a larger inverter

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,639
in the end anyway but it's only 600

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,959
watts

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,839
but it's 24 volt and the really

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,399
important thing

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,600
on the inverter i ended up first getting

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,959
was that this has

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,759
its own ground because the other one had

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,880
ac power with an open ground which was

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,040
ugly

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,079
in the middle there is one of my

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,120
favorite little

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,360
uh adapters there it's uh

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,040
you have a little potentiometer and so

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,560
you input whatever voltage

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,560
and then you can down scale it to

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,880
whatever voltage you need so the

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,680
laptop that was used to create this

00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,519
performance

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,959
while i was writing this performance

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,920
that's a picture of

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,400
that powering the laptop itself and on

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,839
the

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,720
on the very left there is a squid

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,160
of all of my various cable mismanagement

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,559
issues

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,240
so uh that's a fuse box so that if

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,079
anything does go awry

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,919
uh hopefully it'll catch it before

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:25,120
anything goes horribly wrong

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,199
but uh if you notice in that graph there

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,799
there are a number of spots where the

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,720
color gets really dense

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,039
and that's basically because the solar

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,160
is turning on again and off again

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:39,120
uh periodically it'll reach maximum

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,720
it'll reach the maximum charge and then

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,480
it'll turn off the solar panels because

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,480
it doesn't have anything to do

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,960
so i got a 24 volt kettle to boil some

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,200
water

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,200
because that can consume quite a bit of

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,559
power and most of those black

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,039
peaks you see there are when it drains

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,559
the

00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,760
when it's running the electric kettle

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,039
but this is only 800 milliliters at a

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,160
time

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,880
which is a very manual process so i was

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,880
scheming

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,720
of ideas how to hook up my water heater

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,640
which has dual electric and propane

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,280
and it has about 10 gallons

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,799
otherwise known as slightly under 38

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,960
liters

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,760
and i want a microcontroller to monitor

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,000
how much solar power is available

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,280
and dynamically adjust the power output

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,799
so

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,080
when i get those peaks i can just

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,320
basically provide exactly the amount of

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,880
excess power i want

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,799
instead of manually unplugging and

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,600
replugging it and maybe it's drawing too

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,559
much power

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,559
or too little power so

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,600
essentially though i've destroyed a

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,679
one bitsy microcontroller and a pocket

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,039
beagle armboard in the process of trying

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,520
to hook up this little

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,200
regulator that you see pictured uh

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,840
supposedly i can put a p

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:14,400
pwm signal on that and output

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:17,360
uh output an adjustable voltage

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,480
i have numerous other plans uh the most

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,600
important being

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,160
as winter is approaching although we're

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,919
in the

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,919
dead of summer right now but i want to

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,559
get the panels on the roof because

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,520
uh we get about nine months of cloudy

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,080
days here

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,799
and the current location of where the

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,160
panels are

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,480
is just really sub-optimal

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,200
uh i also want to get a low temperature

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,039
shut off

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,880
uh with the lithium iron phosphate

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,039
batteries if it gets much below

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,360
freezing or well you want to get nowhere

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,160
near freezing so you want to make sure

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,760
that it has a safety valve on making

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,080
sure you're not charging the batteries

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,320
in a way that'll damage them

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,760
i want to get the serial data logging i

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,880
haven't really been loving

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,039
the wi-fi logging

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,280
and i wanna this this is what's pictured

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,000
here is i wanna use microcontrollers to

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,240
turn things

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,120
off and on again and using micro python

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,039
or circuit python to do that

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,559
and of course a thermal giraffe for a

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,280
solar system

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,400
huge thanks to scott johnson dassian

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,480
tedea

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,240
keith packard and bart massey and of

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,960
course dlib

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:35,679
for all your help in all of this thanks

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:37,760
very much

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,760
