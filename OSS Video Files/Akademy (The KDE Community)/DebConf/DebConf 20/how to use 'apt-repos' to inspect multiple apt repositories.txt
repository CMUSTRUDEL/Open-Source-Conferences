In this talk I will git a short introduction into a tooling called 'apt-repos' aimed for debian based distribution providers. 

This tool helps people that often work with multiple apt-repositores and suites. Similar to the well known tools 'apt (show|policy|search)', 'apt update', 'dpkg (-l)' it prints information about binary packages and source packages that live in apt-repositories. In contrast to these tools that typically work on a concrete local host with a concrete local apt-setup, this tool allows to inspect (and compare) multiple independent apt-repositories and suites without coupling the local system to these repositories.

Get a first impression about how the tool could help in your daily business as distribution provider; see how the command line tool works and if there's time left how to use it's python3 library within your own infrastructure tools.
