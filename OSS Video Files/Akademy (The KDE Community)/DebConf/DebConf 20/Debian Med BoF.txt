	00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,639
and it's all about

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,639
fun and meeting and

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,120
doing some good things we found better

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,920
beaches in barcelona

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480
swimming was not so challenging there

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,720
but

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,030
who are who are we the debian mid team

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,119
has a lot of uploaders here is

00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,080
[Music]

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,160
the list of the 10 most active ones the

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,920
good thing is that we have

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,160
not so many missings here there are

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,520
other teams which have

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,840
empty bars in these places and we have

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,360
established a quite solid team which i'm

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
very happy about

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,640
we are discussing on the mailing list

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,079
and

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,960
we have a lot of party different

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,000
users here not only developers but also

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,879
people who are

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
using our stuff this is a developer's

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,800
mailing list

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,000
which also some people also some deviant

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,519
people who are doing

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,080
qa work who support us

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
we have a lot of people hunting for bugs

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,000
and

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,600
well that's maybe the reason people call

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
me lita because i'm

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,520
doing a lot of uploads and hunting a lot

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,560
of bugs but

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,680
i'm also trying to harvest a lot of low

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,000
hanging fruits

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,280
bug swiss patches which consume only

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,479
five minutes to solve

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,320
and don't mind about these big red bars

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,200
but see that a lot of other people

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,520
doing really a lot of good job really

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,680
really good jobs

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,680
these are the commits and the debian

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,720
version control system

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,200
on next saturday i have a talk about the

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
effect of our corona sprints and i will

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
go

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,759
more into detail of these graphs i have

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,759
some

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
interesting observations about the

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,040
effects of our sprint

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,759
based on the version control commits

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,000
oh by the way you can interrupt me but i

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,040
currently don't see you so

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,239
if you don't speak please lower your

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,959
mute your microphone but if you want to

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,959
tell something

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,319
okay now i hear an echo and somebody has

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,920
switched on his microphone this was not

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,360
a good idea

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:29,520
so this graph is about the itp

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:33,440
box the itp box means we have a new

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,560
upload done and this new upload of a new

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,360
package done and so

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,480
you see we have some peaks here i can't

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,519
explain but

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,120
i expect to have more peaks in 2020

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,480
actually due to the corona sprint

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,760
efforts we will see

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,800
later on so

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,040
an interesting graph is about

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,879
maintainer per package relation this

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,000
graph describes

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,360
um how many

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,560
people are working on one package i

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,360
ignore less than five commits to one

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,920
package but

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
if there are more than five commits from

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,599
different people

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,480
then it's a good sign if not only one

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,800
person is

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,640
contributing to the package but if at

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,959
least two or even more people

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,959
are contributing an opti-bar graph would

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,879
be if you would here at number zero and

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,080
like a curve like this

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,200
would be helpful okay this

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,480
is um earth graph is

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,040
showing the so-called tasks of the

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,400
debian mid project for the damian mid

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,080
blend

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,159
we have the most of the package in the

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,319
biology task and you see the number of

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,879
package is growing constantly

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,720
and also for the debian mid development

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,760
suppose where you can develop medical

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,200
applications

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,920
it is growing here we have

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,879
also quite some packages in the medical

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,439
imaging

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,319
part and we have epidemiology and we

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,439
have

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,640
uh medical practice and

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,760
but not said much the reason is that

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,959
the biology applications are

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,360
developed at universities and

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,239
attached to medic to scientific

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,880
publications

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,079
and which is usually connected to free

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,160
software

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
and we can only package free software so

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
we have a lot of

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
stuff in this field and we have a lot of

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,680
contributors

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,960
from this field okay

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,040
well i have some kind of history here

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,720
because um

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,880
i said 15 years

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,000
i was working on debian made and after

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,360
50s 50 years

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,600
50 years the people

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,479
in my institute considered using it

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,520
because my

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,000
idea was it would could be used in my

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,800
institute and john meadowcall

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,560
told me only 15 years you young guys

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
should be more patient

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,759
i should hurry up since after 15 years i

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,759
might be dead but you have so much time

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,840
and this is some kind of wisdom i want

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,360
to share with you because

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,919
yeah uh we we should not be frustrated

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
if not so many people start contributing

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,039
in the first year to

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,880
one project and it's um

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,199
such kind of project is not a sprint

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,039
it's a marathon and

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,000
i think we made quite a good pace in

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,120
this marathon

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,520
and we are having progress and

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,240
getting more and more people involved

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,240
which is a good thing

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,600
why did we get so many people in 2012

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,960
i decided to run an effort mentoring of

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,160
the month

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,440
it was well i was inviting people to

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,199
contribute for one month and learn to

00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,880
package medical applications under

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,039
the guy the kind guiding of me or other

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,199
peoples of the deviant mid team it's

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,720
the kind is important for me because

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,759
people should

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,280
not hesitate to ask

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
maybe stupid questions but there are no

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,440
stupid stupid question is a question

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,720
what

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,600
was never asked right so they should ask

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,039
everything

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,360
should ask in open and we try to

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,840
educate kindly and you see the the

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,880
package that was worked on so the

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,000
student which is learning

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,680
can choose freely what package to do and

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,199
then we try to

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,120
help him solving this problem the

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,479
maybe not so good news is that these

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,919
people while

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,080
finished the work are not so active

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,039
anymore but we have some active people

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,000
and

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,639
maybe even some people come back again

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
like

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,120
malia zemani who i teached in 2015.

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,039
she came back for the deviant mid sprint

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,599
in 2020 so

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,639
these people know what you do and know

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,759
the principle

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:10,080
and maybe they come back

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:13,520
um i'm very proud about that

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,599
debian made has or this is a typo

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:21,360
well no it has 36 dds and dms

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,400
need to check we have 20 debian

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,840
developers

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,919
who confirmed that they are only debian

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,199
developer because the debian mid product

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,039
exists so that means

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,199
there would not be daymond developers if

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,120
the debian mid project

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:42,560
would not exist this makes more than one

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,599
developer per year and this makes about

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,759
two percent of debian developers

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,520
and if you consider that the debian made

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,800
project in principle is not very

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,400
important for the whole debian

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,280
distribution

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,080
this makes quite some share because

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,560
nobody would

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,599
realize if those bioli biology packages

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,479
would not be inside debian

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,199
except of those few bioinformaticans in

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,039
the world who really rely on it

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,319
they would probably use something else

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,120
but

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
we made some contribution to the whole

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,599
deviant system and

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,639
i'm pretty proud about this because also

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,840
10 out of the 20 people above

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,800
extended activity to other fields in

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,840
debian

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,240
yeah and 14 of these 20 people

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,479
are remain active in debian mid and some

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,240
are doing really other things which is

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,399
i think a good thing for the avian in

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,760
general

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,440
the conclusions are that the time i

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,880
spent into the mentoring

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,920
are really worth the effort and the work

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,920
is bearable

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,519
and the good thing for me is that i also

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,959
learn from the students by

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,200
because they have read the latest

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,320
documentation which i have read 20 years

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,080
ago

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:06,000
and so i can learn new stuff from them

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,720
and the major advantage is that

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,720
we can work together with upstream

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,279
developers a lot of these

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
mrm students are upstream developers of

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,480
some software

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,080
they're packaged their own code which

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,120
means

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,560
they know how the package should behave

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,360
on an installation which is a real

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,040
advantage

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,880
since i'm not a user of all the software

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,640
i'm packaging myself

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:36,640
and when upstream is doing the packaging

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,720
i can be sure that it works as expected

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,920
so at least 50 percent of the students

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,120
had a strong connection to upstream and

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,080
um some of the packages would not have

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,200
been possible

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,760
without second contribution

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
yes a team what what is the debian

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,959
midfield team for me

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,880
the definition of a team became that i'm

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,080
waking up in the morning and realize

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,959
that somebody else has

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,160
solved the problem from yesterday it

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,360
really happens

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,560
and it's a great feeling you are you

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,200
go to bed are wondering oh how can i

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,440
solve this

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,959
and ask for help on the mailing list on

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,880
rc also and then

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,360
you wake up and it solves that this is

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,360
really great

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,240
yeah we have a link to either pet

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,680
um you found in the i can

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,480
probably um put it here in the in the

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,240
notes and we

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,360
i will now stop and come back to you

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,200
and you can see me then and you can ask

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,040
questions for me this was all i wanted

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,680
to present

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,040
and i would love to do the open

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,560
discussion now

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,760
because um

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,440
because that's all i wanted to say now

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,640
here you can ask questions first

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,640
and then i can continue with um with

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,240
things about our sprints and so

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,480
but i want to hear questions i prefer to

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,440
questions i think you can also show your

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,800
faces

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,160
if you have a camera but please unmute

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,160
only if you are speaking

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
okay

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
so anybody want to say something

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,560
if not i show the either pet no i before

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,839
i'll show the either pet i

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,519
show a if here in the

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:38,560
um you can enjoy

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,560
about my background and then yes

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,880
shortly there's a link to the either pet

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,850
which you can where you can write

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,480
things

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,480
[Music]

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,320
and i would be really happy if somebody

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,440
would do notes there because i'm

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,720
occupied with

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,639
talking and chatting and other people

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,920
could write down their note and if there

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,279
are any notes

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,560
i should respond to please mention this

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,040

introduce

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,200
um give a short introduction

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,399
to know who we are this is usual

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,959
thing for our debian made buffs and i

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,399
start

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:39,120
in the sequence of my screen here

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,760
i think jatan you are just moderator but

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,440
you are

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,880
perfectly welcome if you want to say

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,519
something please unmute

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,519
unmute yourself and say something

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:56,720
thank you

00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:01,200
so um currently what is the state of the

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:05,040
kobe 19 hackathon in the deviant team

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,160
well we have we're running three

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,240
hackathons in total the last one was

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:16,399
last week i need to admit that

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,200
the effect last week was not as amazing

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,399
as i was hoping for but the first one in

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,600
april

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,639
it was a really amazing experience

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,200
i think some of the people here in in

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,920
the

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,880
um in the both were not members before

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,639
and they came to us inside the buff we

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,480
have a lot of people who

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,760
either came as a new members

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,040
came back from somewhere and

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,079
even more amazing was the real support

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,240
we got from ftp

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,160
master i have in the more than 25

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,000
being a debian developer i have never

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,560
experienced that

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,240
several of my packages were accepted in

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,519
less than 24 hours

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,320
so usual packers needs well

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,120
two weeks four weeks depending on the

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,600
time ftp master have but we got it

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,320
in less than 24 hours and not only one

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,240
package

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,040
we got lots of packages we have um

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,800
we have some page where we are listing

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,040
all those packages and this was

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,720
really great it was amazing it was a lot

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,839
of fun and my work

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,160
changed from doing the pure

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,839
technical packaging work to organizing

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,360
people sponsoring packages

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,120
um organizing that everyone who wanted

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,480
to help gets a

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,959
sensible task that was

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,320
probably to solve so this was a really

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,360
amazing effect and

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:51,760
i will report in detail about this

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,760
on saturday okay

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,839
so next one is sao

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,839
would you like to say something

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,040
now you are muted in case you want to

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,959
say something

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,199

the pekkas you can say something

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,880
you can also show your camera or

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
whatever

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,720
bad i can hear you i can't really hear

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,440
you

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,440
can you be close to the microphone or so

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,759
yeah can you hear me now yeah it's

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:02,079
better it's way better yeah

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:05,759
yeah maybe it's just oh overloaded

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:09,839
yeah yeah uh

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,880
pandas is my most popular package

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,600
uh we should uh we should maybe try to

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,560
figure out at some point

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,560
whether we could uh and unstick the

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,720
pandas transition given that it's

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,600
and it's a bunch of bioinformatics

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,800
packages that

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,160
break mainly a python biome formatting

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,160
and a couple of q2 things

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,279
now you did really great help with some

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,920
of the

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,800
python packages also snake make it was

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,680
really great

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,680
help thanks for this

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,839
so um graham do you want to give some

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,839
short introduction

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,120
your mic is muted

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,160
graham your mic is muted in case you are

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,319
talking

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,360
you are the only one you can unmute

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,600
yourself

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,600
okay

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,480
hi i can't hear you anyway

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,480
i can't see you but i can't hear you

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,160
well i i know about you that you are

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,760
also a member of the db chem team

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,960
team and dbcam is a similar team like

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,480
the debian mid team

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,880
it's working on chemistry software

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,760
and we have we share some packages which

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,880
are relevant for chemistry and biology

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,440
and maybe graham might be able to fix

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,960
his

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,559
mic or not but you know how

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,120
others might know how him a little bit

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,559
the next on my screen is christian

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,559
christian do you want to say something

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,160
okay i can say something can you hear me

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,000
yes okay

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,919
so i'm i'm not sure if i'm really a

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,200
member of the deviant team probably not

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,720
so i've been

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,559
at the two sprints i think it was a two

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
sprint so you can consider yourself a

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
member and maybe if you have done some

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,760
commits

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,080
well who is a member yeah i've been

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,280
teaching some basic packaging i remember

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,400
one time yeah

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,679
uh for the for the first corona sprint i

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
think i

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,440
i suggested that you look at big blue

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,520
button

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,160
i don't know that was the same question

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,400
as the first question

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,440
what is the outcome of the of the corona

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,320
sprint so and

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,960
i don't know if you know there's the uh

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,559
frost con

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,559
running in parallel today and they're

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,559
using big blue button

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,080
we uh we use it for teaching at the

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,080
university

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,919
and we already organized the conference

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,360
using big blue button and we're going to

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,000
have the next one

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,000
in a couple of weeks it's a bit hard to

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,600
install ontarian systems uh

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,200
as i understand so the university is

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,640
providing this for us

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,240
but of course it would be nice to have

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,120
this as a driven package

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,960
so perhaps you know the tech kids if how

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,039
they

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,360
they had a talk in the morning uh also

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,120
using big blue button for schools

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,799
so i think that's a that's a great tool

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,840
for conferences this seems to work as

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,400
well

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,480
this is ditzy right so yeah how could

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,559
can you compare a big blue button with

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,280
jc and because you seem to know both

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,160
uh so i think big blue button is is

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,679
nicer for

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,919
presentations i don't know if you can

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,320
upload pdfs here and show this

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,600
you can you can have a whiteboard so you

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,200
can

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,440
draw on it draw a line so i use it when

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,440
i

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,080
when i quest my students i can you can

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,080
open the whiteboard and they can also

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,080
draw on the whiteboard so you can

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,400
develop stuff together on the

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,559
which is quite nice okay i think well i

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,440
have seen your request for the package

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,880
and i think

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,919
it would be really great to have in

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,280
debian but um

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,400
i'm afraid you overestimate the power

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,880
behind the

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,440
packaging team of the deviant mid people

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,760
we have we are struggling

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,640
really hard to get a lot of complex um

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,640
packages done which are more the focus

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,039
of the deviant mid team than this

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,159
more general one yeah it doesn't have to

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,200
be done by the w

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,600
team yeah yeah sure yeah yeah i know

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,880
and everything so i think it would be

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,480
really nice so i don't know how the

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,799
university did this

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,159
it's actually working fairly well um

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,640
right now but uh

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,720
that would be a great tool for you

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,240
should ask the university guys if they

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,720
are running japan or ubuntu and so

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,480
make something a colleague rented a

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,080
server and he set it up a month before

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,480
the university did this so we've been

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,400
using this since march i think already

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,080
and there's a script you just have a

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,039
container and you install it in the

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,880
container and then

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,559
okay it does some weird things and it

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,320
works um

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:06,240
so that's a bit complex or

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:10,320
not transparent uh to see how it works

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,080
okay so um the thing is if

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,559
people solve their problems via

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,159
container they

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,720
need to get the debian package is um

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,840
lower yeah but i i fully agree i would

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,280
love to have a package but

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:30,080
um yeah we'll see

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,760
okay so far yeah you are the next on my

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,760
screen here do you want to give a short

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:38,559
introduction

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,559
yeah are you able to hear me yes

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,480
you can talk yeah you can talk we hear

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,679
you yeah

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,320
yeah my name is nilesh and i've been a

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,520
member of

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,679
debian med for a few months by now i've

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,080
been

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,440
fixing bugs and writing auto package

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,000
tests and i'd also be in a part of

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,520
the three sprints and i introduced some

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,880
new packages there

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,120
so that would be it i guess yeah english

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,120
is a google home of code student

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,559
and he's done a lot of good work

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,600
i this year we had two google summer of

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,720
code students

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,080
one who had the task to write auto

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,520
package tests

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,240
for existing deviant packages which is

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,120
basically the same tasks and we are

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,000
doing

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:37,120
since four years and um

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,919
this year right before

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,720
the google summer of codes um

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,080
application

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,679
times stopped we had this debian

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,720
mid-sprint and the corona breakout and i

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,080
was able to get another project accepted

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,600
to

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:59,440
package dedicated um

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,559
uh corona um fighting applications for

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,200
debian made which

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,880
was well i don't i do not really

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,480
remember this was probably

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,320
nilesh's work and one of the

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,000
the outer package tests also or there

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,039
was other way around so we have

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,240
two students from india who contributed

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,360
a lot of good work

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,600
and did a lot of nice qa work and worked

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,000
on new packages

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,799
this was really fun and this was all

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
also

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:31,679
thanks to corona that we had two

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,360
students who did great contributions

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,400
it would be really hard for me if i

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,200
would have to decide

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,960
one of the very promising students if

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,840
you had only one project

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,520
and yeah it's i'm really happy about

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,159
this

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,799
so on continues sam has written that he

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,960
is not

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,640
able to connect to his microphone the

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,200
last one i didn't ask is

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,760
dr dance could you give a short

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,760
introduction

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,840
after unmuting your mic because we

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,840
cannot hear anything

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,919
hi can you hear me yes hi

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,360
nice to meet you i'm daniele and

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,799
i'm i have one package

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:25,279
in debian that is nifty to daikon

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,880
and um i'm the developer of that package

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,080
and

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,440
well i've not used it anymore since a

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,640
lot of time but

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,840
i'm still a debian user and

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,400
and i'm working in robotics

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,760
and i would like to help somehow i don't

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,039
know

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,640
so i'm here to listen and

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:52,000
cool cool yeah all things

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,720
this medical imaging stuff is um

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,120
a little bit hard for me because i have

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,039
no

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,880
idea at all about medical imaging but i

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,080
frequently need to fix bugs in these

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,159
packages

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,799
a lot of them were introduced by the

00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,760
neurodeviant team

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,799
by namely michael hunker and jaroslav

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,360
frantenko

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,080
which did a really great work to have

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,400
this

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,720
new debian framework but it turned out

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,960
that over the last years

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,960
they became less and less active because

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,400
they have other things to do they are

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,520
kind and friendly and if if i ask them a

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,279
question

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:34,000
about their packages they are fixing it

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,559
but we definitely need more manpower

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,919
behind

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:41,279
this nifty dicom and

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,559
everything else package so if you could

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,760
contribute

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,520
something to these packages this would

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,320
be really great i would really support

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,159
it it would

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,279
if you commit something to our uh

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,279
salsa repositories and ping me i will

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,840
sponsor your packages and so this would

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:03,279
be really great

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,440
okay cool i actually kind of

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,600
switched my field of work in the last

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,880
year that's why i haven't

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,080
used nifty and i come for

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,480
last year's i'm now working in robotics

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,919
yeah i don't know if there's competence

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,360
of the debian map

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,000
team or debian science maybe

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,440
well the robotics is also interesting it

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,520
is um

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,039
it's a little we are very open the

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,000
debian mid team yeah but

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,400
uh it's i think it's stretching too far

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,400
to dive into robotics but there is

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,960
a robotics task inside debian science

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,360
to dive into this deviant science is

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,240
more or less an umbrella for

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,279
everything else which has no specific

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,919
dedicated

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,520
plans like i said graham is member of

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,159
the debut chem team

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,679
we have also debian edu we have um

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,000
debian electronics

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,880
yeah and everything that doesn't fit or

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,120
when i'm not

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,000
enough people are working in debian

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,320
science

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,080
and there's a robotics team and they are

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,360
have robotics

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,440
tasks and um yeah

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,400
if this is more your feedback work and

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,120
and you are

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,320
interested more into this field i'd

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,320
recommend to

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,279
join the debian science team and

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,679
look out there i'm also lurking on the

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,640
list

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,080
not with the same intensity as in debian

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,840
made i read it every three or four days

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,080
but if you need help and for the

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:40,559
introduction i'm fine with doing this

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,559
okay cool thanks now you're welcome

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,520
so we hit sao was in the beginning not

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,240
able to switch on her mic if it's fine

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,159
now please speak now

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:57,360
hello can you hear me yes hello everyone

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,240
very clearly my name is sao and recently

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,520
i'm

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,120
doing some new package to deviantmet

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,760
and recently

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,760
i have some

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,200
some some questions about

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,399
packing the package

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,440
which is the brandon new package

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:24,480
there is a dependency

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,399
called duke pipe then there is some

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,360
uh embedding code inside of duke pipe so

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,799
i

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:37,520
quite confusing how to deal with the

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:40,960
uh embedded code with this situation

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,840
yeah this is a kind of a major blocker

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,840
in

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,840
packaging if you have

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,200
the javascript included in in

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
big amounts and um i wrote you on the

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,320
mailing list

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,240
first thank you for for your packaging

00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,880
thank you for the other packages you did

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,520
this is

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,039
great stuff and i really hope that you

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,600
might be able to do

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,159
google sum of code next year so first of

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,200
all thanks

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:13,039
think of this and this actual question

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:17,200
is um i cannot give a recipe you know

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:20,240
it starts with um um

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,279
well checking what javascript is

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,120
inside the source code it's specifically

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,919
the minimize javascript is a problem

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,600
because we consider it

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,960
binary code and not source code

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,320
and then seek if any debian packages

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:42,320
is contained this javascript

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,520
right we had this react uh stuff

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,399
but then i when i thought oh react this

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,640
some something famous it should be we

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,720
should have packaged i learned that

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,960
four or five other packages are

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,720
including it so

00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,960
if others can do so unclean stuff

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,399
it's not really green right right we we

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,320
need to package it

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,559
this would be the clean way and we need

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,840
to remove the code copy copies but

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:13,760
it's not your task as a beginner to to

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,399
do this so i would try to do the same

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,159
i've seen some other javascripts i do

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,200
not remember now but

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,840
yes check if there is a copy of it

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,360
inside debian with this packet

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:32,240
remove it from your source code

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:34,320
by using the files excluded

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,440
statement inside the debian copyright

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,840
file i can

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,320
show you and in the

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,039
in the chat here rebecca is giving the

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,279
the hint

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:50,799
that npm to dab is a tool you can use

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:54,480
so maybe you check the the chat for

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,679
further hints then i can give orally

00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,120
yeah and it it

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:05,519
will take some patience to to get

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,720
all this done because it's

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:12,080
it's a bit too heavy for beginner and

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,840
we need to cooperate in this you

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,880
um i brought you an answer to your

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,399
sponsoring requests and maybe you also

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,760
answer there and say

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,159
um i have a problem with this and this

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,320
and then we go step by step through it

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,440
and other people might help you on the

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,480
mailing list

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,679
just um this is what they also try to

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,480
propagate to be

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,440
open and ask your questions in open in

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,240
the mailing list

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:45,039
because um the work is tricky

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,399
and there are a lot of people who know

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,000
the tricks how to

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,279
deal with it or you who might help you

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,120
as i said in the beginning of my with my

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,360
slides um

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,440
a team is solving your problems while

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,360
you are sleep sleeping and

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,720
you can you but you need to tell the

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,880
people what actual problem you have

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,159
okay all this what is the head all these

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,880
general remarks

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,000
so we cannot solve these details here

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,399
and this

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,200
this buff but we we can manage later

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,799
yes thank you and thanks again for for

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,159
your work on this

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,159
and for joining here this both

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:32,640
so anybody else

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:36,640
has anybody checked irc or either

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:40,880
pads or any locations where people

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,880
might ask from remote

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,679
yes i am at the irc charts

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,600
okay so currently we have not questions

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,080
there okay

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,960
i'm even wondering if we can uncover

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,640
this uh

00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:00,399
secret url to the gt meeting

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,240
on on the irc chats there is another

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,000
art in there that says somebody from

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,240
eighth part is wondering how to use the

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,240
host

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,799
oh being second handed don't know if

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,679
they have the name they don't have the

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,840
url or some other problem

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,039
yeah i can very bad there is an echo in

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,840
your

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,279
i think this is in the deviant

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,000
teams meetings you were better to

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,760
understand it's a shame today because

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,320
yeah anyway but you have given your

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,279
hints here in the chat

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,480
so which we try to store this chat lock

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,320
for

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,039
for later andreas yeah i think we have a

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,760
question

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,279
related to new health anyway connected

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,519
to david met is

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,000
new health connected to the real earth

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,679
uh we use a question from

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,720
jew ryan okay

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,200

can you can you write it down i i have

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,159
not yet about this

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,919
what was it the channel

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,240
we have an ilc channel i just should

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,240
watch

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,839
can you print it in the yes i will

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,790
share with you in the in the message

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:24,929
yep

00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,929
[Music]

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:40,480
so dc20 talks

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,480
but i'm i'm watching dc 20 talks

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,839
i don't see this

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,399
can someone who wants to know something

00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:03,839
for me please

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,839
repeat the question in dc 20 talks

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,240
someone britain wrote someone is either

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:23,119
pet is wondering how to use jitsi well

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:26,320
like i will i will uncover this

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:31,839
url here to to invite more people

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,839
if they want to

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,000
last last seconds or last minutes of

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,680
this talk

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,920
and then we can can join here because i

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,520
don't think it makes any sense to

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,079
exclude two or three

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:53,599
potential uh newcomers here

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,880
because of gt can manage this

00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:00,079
ah can you help okay well for

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,839
new health and say um

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:07,839
we had a package of new health it is

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:11,520
um written in triton

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,079
and but the triton environment was a

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,930
little bit

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,119
complex and had

00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:18,400
[Music]

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,880
well it was hard to keep the

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,680
debian packaging and the trident

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,079
packages up to date and so

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,599
the maintainer of the new health package

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,920
decided to

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,960
stop providing debian packages of it

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,079
i'm not sure if this was a really

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,079
good idea

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,839
to try it

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:51,359
can you please mute i as a microphone

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:54,720
or just uh here now in the the digits

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:58,320
channel and um

00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,520
have no sound in your video stream it's

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,800
that only one source of sound is is

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,599
running this would be very helpful

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,359
um i see michael cruzo joined michael do

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,200
you want to say something for the last

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,599
minutes

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,560
oh hi everybody i've been helping out in

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,040
the ether pad in irc with questions

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,400
so it's nice to see some new faces and

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,560
voices

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,400
and i've been absent these last few

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,520
weeks focusing other matters i hope to

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,240
uh

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,359
resume my my package activities soon

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,280
anyhow i've been

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,599
working in bioinformatics and now

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,320
workflow technologies

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,720
um so always happy answer questions

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,560
about

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,160
computational workflow languages and

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,599
standards

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,079
and um excited to see more

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,680
overlap between the debian med team and

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,280
other groups in debian

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,200
i don't think it's been highlighted yet

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,359
but um

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,560
the bazel package has entered the new

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,599
queue so i wanted to give

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,880
big congratulations to olek and thanks

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,160
to the folks at google who've been

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,240
helping us out

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,040
so we're hoping that that can be used to

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,400
package tensorflow which unlocks a ton

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,839
of scientific

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,880
and engineering packages out there so

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,079
yay for crossteam collaboration

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,079
yeah this is i forgot to mention in when

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,400
i was asked about the deviant mid-sprint

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,520
the first one was

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,880
very active and oleg why not

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:30,240
started packaging bazel because

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,240
tensorflow is a

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,359
machine learning workflow machine

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,560
learning

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:42,079
um package which

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,920
is developed by google but it needs

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:49,040
the bazel um it's kind of a

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,079
build system for like make or but

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,359
way more complex and it was a major

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,480
blocker that we had no

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,079
bazel package for debian and oleg did a

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,920
really really great job

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:04,480
to get it done it's nearly done and

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,240
i've said to him if you get it done

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,320
until deb conf

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,280
then is really great and it's now in the

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,599
new queue it only depends from

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,800
ftp master and i really hope for their

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,040
support so

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,160
yes yes we also welcome folks check out

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,880
the package now

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,440
you know uh it's in bootstrap mode so

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,119
it's just

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,480
what we hope to be enough to package

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,640
tensorflow

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,520
and kind of a more mature package that

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,240
can be used

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,119
for making other packages but also just

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,800
end user

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:37,440
um uh use of bazel as a

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,640
general packaging system is coming so

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,880
it's not meant to be full feature it's

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,920
why it's just called bazel bootstrap

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,200
yeah so and to

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,079
shortly introduce michael cruzo he is

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,320
he became recently a debian developer

00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,599
and is one of the most active people

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,520
in debian made and is also

00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,720
a debian developer because of debian

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,839
medics is one of the people i

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,680
introduced without names

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,359
and i'm really happy that michael is on

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,440
our team so we have

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,040
one new user who has the name mercy

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,280
do you want to give a short introduction

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,599
do you have a question

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:25,839
but you need to unmute your microphone

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:25,839
for to do so

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,560
from nigeria doing a video from nigeria

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,240
yeah i'm so happy to

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,800
be in this conference i'm glad to listen

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,960
to you

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,400
so i got that requested for the link to

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,839
try and introduce myself

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,839
so i'm a student of filtering based on

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,839
technology

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,640
since we are basically running out of

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,560
time

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:14,319
i recommend you can

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:17,359
join the deviant making it and

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,839
maybe you get some more information if

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,079
you are really interested

00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:25,119
and this would be cool if if you

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,640
join us and do some more maybe you can

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,079
learn packaging as a in the mentoring of

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,200
the months

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,960
project or something like this

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:40,000
so we have new two more

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,440
fellow debianites um

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,480
and have about 30 seconds

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,000
to ask a question or so so

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,119
if you want to use something unmute your

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,240
microphone but

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,079
please lower all the other sound

00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,839
resources in your

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:04,079
room before you unmute the microphone

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:08,079
yeah hi

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,800
hi um uh what's the status of debate

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,200
made on

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,680
arm processes probably on mobile

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,920
processors

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,599
uh i did not understand what is your

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,040
stabile made on on what

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:24,480
on on arm

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,440
okay well as as any other debian

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,560
packages we

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,440
try to provide packages on

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,960
every release architectures we have a

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,680
lot of

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,079
packages of dvr mid that are running on

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,760
arm

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:42,640
and michael cruzo is very active

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,480
to support simdee michael do you want to

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,920
say something about sim d which is quite

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,839
interesting

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,880
yeah the cindy everywhere library helps

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:57,440
uh any application that was written

00:42:52,880 --> 00:43:00,079
for these processor specific uh

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,200
processing extensions um run on other

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,680
processors

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,200
so um that we actually got as a google

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,119
summer of code project in coordination

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,520
with the open biomax foundation

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,040
it's in debian a new release is coming

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,240
so previously we really

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,160
you know we were open to other

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,880
architectures but we didn't prioritize

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,119
it

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,920
and now because this is less of an issue

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,200
we're seeing a lot more arm 64 builds

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,760
um arm 32-bit builds are not a priority

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,560
but we would accept patches especially

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,440
if upstream

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,440
accepts them as well

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,319
and there's a general interest in arm 64

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,359
computing for between

00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:39,520
apple and some hpc

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,800
uh super computing clusters that are

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,520
also trying out

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,880
arm-based processors so expect to see a

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,720
lot better compatibility

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,079
especially for 64-bit arm computing

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,400
we are so as we are happy about patches

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,599
in

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,640
any way so not only for arm but yes

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,640
um just

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:06,160
we're on all of time and it has been

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:09,920
a great mod and thank you

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:13,040
andreas and um everybody

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,160
so we will have a break of one hour

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,680
and see you in the next talk okay thanks

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,880
for all your joints

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:32,560
see you in the new project

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:32,560
