00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,440
i'm daniel linharo i'm from cultural

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,240
brazil

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,800
i will talk about our localization to

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,800
portuguese

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:31,599
portuguese how we are working

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:34,960
and where we want to go

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:39,440
uh nowadays um

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:44,239
did you know upload science 2017

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:49,920
i i was member of depth conf 19

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:53,360
lookout team i usually talk about that

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,239
and first after events here in brazil

00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:01,520
like fisley little nowhere campus body

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:05,519
heavy and others

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,880
kind of events

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,000
a member of this team this localization

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,280
team and i

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,479
usually help to

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,759
dragons i organize dubbing events

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,759
here in brazil like that depending

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:29,439
that we had last weekend

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,920
then release body when we had a new

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,920
release

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,840
last year

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,079
events here and

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,759
free software events here

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,880
so it's a little about me

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,920
so what is l10n

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,920
and tenants

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,000
acronym for localization

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,040
so it's because in between

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,360
l and n we had 10

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,560
characters so it's easy to

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
to write and

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,680
we we save space

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:32,959
to to write

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,959
like this so it's easy and faster

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,280
so when you see l10n you

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,920
[Music]

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,879
just you expand in your mind to

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,879
localization

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:53,360
so in debian we had a lot of

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:57,200
things working for this and one of them

00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,720
is for portuguese our team

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,239
so you can see in food page

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,560
for dependent website that is

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,599
a lot of other things so

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,120
portuguese is just one

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,720
so we had a lot of others

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,879
and that is working hard too to help

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:27,120
deven be more universe universal

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:32,319
so thanks for another change too

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:35,680
and so

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,680
our team is

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,400
working science in 1999.

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,920
this thing basically had our

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,760
qualitation and things working

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,799
through mainly instinct so basically

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,840
everything works using our

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,840
main list

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,280
change information emails when you

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:18,560
want to to know about some

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,560
things when you say that you want to

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:27,040
translate something we will review

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:30,400
you send to

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,440
include a buggy so

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,800
everything's we had a key a

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,800
process based on

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,840
so you are uh else

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:50,080
when the robots find

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:54,840
and they subject some some kind of

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,840
specific information they know

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:02,479
how to lead with that

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,479
information and work with uh

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,479
with this mayor so

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,800
they update some kind

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,800
basic information to

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,800
[Music]

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,840
where we can know how

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,240
how how many packet packages are

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,680
updated how many pages

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,520
are are outdated

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:39,120
this kind of information that is

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:43,919
based on cellular urls

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:47,039
whatever things usually act

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:51,039
uh we usually active

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:55,759
and package the description so

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:59,120
for people don't understand better

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:02,400
not understand well english

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,800
so you can install your

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,160
system in portuguese and and you do

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,240
a apt search you

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,440
will find your description in portuguese

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,880
so it's our one effort

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,479
for our team

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,520
we do this this kind of thing in

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,639
uh this

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,840
this is uh thing that we don't do

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:39,199
we using a mail list anymore this is a

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,880
web-based system so

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:46,160
the dtss system

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,599
that is i have owing

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,800
webbing so you don't don't need to

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,080
subscribe to our mailing list you would

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,759
only create

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,360
a login to the system and

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:05,360
start you and translation

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,800
and review package from from there

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,680
it's easy so you it's

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,680
the easier way to contribute

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,440
so

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,440
and now it's in the

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,479
official debian

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,160
structure so it

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:33,360
the dsa thing is

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,400
take care about the servers now

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,319
so it's under the

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,440
dot rg in infrastructure

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,800
so it's better now

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,840
another thing that we use to act is

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,319
on that installer so when you you

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:58,000
style deven you can see all the

00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,599
information in portuguese so

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,400
yeah how this kind of information

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,400
is because we work on this

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,840
this is important because

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,479
here in brazil a lot of people don't

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,000
don't talk don't talk and don't

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,479
understand english

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,479
very well

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:33,680
uh i am uh almost one of these people

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:38,479
uh devon webb page so

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,479
devon website and we had um

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:47,360
uh effort to translate science

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:50,720
to data has our information

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,320
translated to be

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,440
more accessible for people and people

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
files there is a file that incites

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,880
package

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,880
with information with

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,839
inside package so if

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,720
kind of things that is inside and

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
that is package has so

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,240
we we do this this translation

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,519
too so what we have done

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,800
is the last last is

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,800
two years basically

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:49,040
so we had nowadays

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,600
the installer 100 are

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:58,160
translated so our strings

00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:02,839
for the the installer

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,839
are translated to portuguese

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
so

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,839
it's a big things that is

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,160
it's important for for brazil

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,360
so you uh when you install you'll see

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,640
everything every message

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,640
in brazil in portuguese

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,600
and another things that we have

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:37,360
done this is to dublin websites it's our

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,720
our main efforts and nowadays

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,640
so we can

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,680
see that it almost all

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,800
file is there they have

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,200
have been translated is up to

00:10:50,800 --> 00:11:00,720
date and only 19

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:04,079
file lists are outdated today

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,320
and we had

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,760
eight thousand seven hundred and forty

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,240
eight five years

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:15,440
not translated here it's a

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,040
probably not never

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,240
be uh with a number zero here

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,770
because here we had um

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,279
several

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:28,640
[Music]

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,680
uh security

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,680
alerts that is

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,160
not interest to be translated

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
because who who read this kind of

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,320
information

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,000
don't need to be translated usually

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:51,040
and all the old news

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,040
that don't need to be translated anymore

00:11:51,279 --> 00:12:00,240
don't make sense anymore and so

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,760
here at least uh

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,620
8 000 files will never

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,560
be be translated so

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:13,040
[Music]

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:16,560
we always have a high number here

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,560
if not translated files

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,880
in may we do uh

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:32,320
our last sprint for the thing

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,320
and that in that date we had

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:39,600
167 pages out of date

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:44,399
an important space uh

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:47,680
during uh 30 days and that is

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,399
uh we did we did uh i

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,760
event here in brazil called uh freaking

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,480
castles

00:12:51,760 --> 00:13:00,160
that is for a month

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:04,880
so because of this spring

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,880
is during 30 days

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,360
uh so during this time we had

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,639
four new translated pages

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,480
and six four pages with translates

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,079
updated

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:24,160
so we had a great work for

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,160
our team and spirits uh

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,360
at least four or five new contributors

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,079
and it's a very interesting interesting

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,839
work

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,839
in the spirit

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,920
uh another

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,680
efforts that we have done in

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,079
this times it's a flowchart for helping

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,760
people

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,760
start contributors so

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,240
it's for a development web pages

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,240
so

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
we had only the website

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:11,360
the week page with the

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,399
this description how to do uh

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:19,199
translation and review so

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:22,560
here we try to do a more visual thing

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,600
and we we had to

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:30,240
improve this but it's

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,440
a initial version that is

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,480
better than nothing so

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,760
people like it

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,959
it's better than with everything uh

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,160
a week it's more

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,600
understandable so

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,120
we had to improve here

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:57,680
but it's it's a good start

00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:00,720
for us another

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,800
things that we do spirit

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,839
it's a video

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,360
in our youtube

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:15,120
channel i i don't remember

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,560
it it's in for tube 2 but i think

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,160
it's it is and

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:26,560
this is for a new a neutral

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:30,399
translation so it's a explain

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,360
how how you do a new translation

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,959
from the development side website from

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,519
the beginning

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:44,399
so it's more visual more visual

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:47,600
so you can follow the the process and

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,720
and see people doing

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,880
and from

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,920
paulo's antenna it's 20 22 minutes

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:02,320
and so it's easy

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:05,519
easy way to to see how how things works

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:10,000
and another videos video that

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:13,279
he do it's uh for a review

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
website review so he show how the

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,680
process

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,360
works it's for

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:27,040
16 minutes june so

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:30,720
people can view and understand how

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,720
how the process works and

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,240
yeah it's easy easy

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,199
uh be be easier

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,199
for people

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,839
so another

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,240
things we usually to do is a regular

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,399
meetings

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,680
at our rc channel

00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,800
it's we do this during

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:05,199
a year at least so

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:09,199
science type of 19 we stop it

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:13,360
i don't remember why exactly but we

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:19,360
have stopped then no

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:23,199
no nobody calls a new meeting and

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:26,240
and didn't occur anymore

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,760
we had to to do it

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,520
again it was good

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:37,840
at that time

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,480
so do you have certificates

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,480
of course

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,799
we have our main

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:55,039
difficult it's to to have few

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:58,720
contributors so

00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,919
people people comes and go

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:06,320
so there are another things

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:09,360
in life to do and

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:13,360
so they came and contributes one

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:17,919
or two weeks and

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:21,679
disappear so we had a

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:28,000
few people there still contribute

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:31,600
so because because of this we had

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,880
some uh working stop it

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:39,200
waiting for for people

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,400
to to do and another

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,120
difficult that we see

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,600
it's because the process for beginners

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,160
is

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:53,600
a little complicated so we

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,760
we try to just simplify

00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:01,919
try doing that video slow shot

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:05,679
it's kind of things so we think

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:09,440
it's tr try to

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,440
to be easy for people but

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,080
we we can't we can improve it

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,640
anymore and we will try to do

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
this

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:29,600
so we had our to-do list

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:34,080
and what do we want to do

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,080
and we had a

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:44,240
uh we had appendix for a

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,679
a lot of things so yeah we had

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,240
at least 32 requests for

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,240
reviews

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:58,880
so we want to reduce

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,480
it to zero

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,480
and when we do this

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,080
we will try to improve without our

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,400
contribution

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,400
flow

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,960
and we we

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:23,360
we want to to

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:27,120
to to to put our debian website

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,679
up to date but we

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,520
we know that we we have to improve our

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,360
contribution flow

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:39,039
that is um so complicated for people

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,840
people nowadays does doesn't want to

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,840
work anymore

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:50,480
with image emails people

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:54,159
maybe i i think it

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,039
doesn't know how to use

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,600
and sometimes i think they they don't

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,120
know how

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,120
to change a subject

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,159
email so we

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,520
lost some time time

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:16,000
teaching how to change a subject

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:19,039
in email so

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,039
we are trying this time uh

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,039
a flow usually only gauge

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,360
in our case also and

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,240
that is how processes can can be done

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,919
there

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,120
so we will we want to improve this

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,120
process so

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,799
but before this we want to reduce

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:48,320
our penis

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,520
so after

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,559
this we hope

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,120
before the end of the year

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,480
we start a new campaign for new control

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,520
builders

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:06,640
so with a new flow

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,640
we can we can

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,559
may have a new contributors

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,480
and we have of course

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,480
when you improve a contribution

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:29,120
contribution floor we will have to

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:33,440
to update our fluorescent flow chart

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,559
wiki documentation everything so

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,280
after this we do a campaign for a new

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,280
contributor

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,559
and we had a

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:52,159
standard vocabulary in south very great

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:55,600
so we want to improve so

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,640
a way to use this

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,480
to help and be easier

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,520
to use so this is

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:10,799
the something that

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,799
we had in our goals to the future

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,840
of course can we can do more

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,520
than this but it's uh

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:26,559
just a little uh

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,559
we can do this and more and more

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:34,000
but for at least six months

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:38,720
had a lot of works

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,720
so i think it's it's

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:48,640

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:46,960
and try to do a

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:51,360
flow and organize a process

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,640
that is true to start and try to

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,480
to focus on some things

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,039
not not to start to to do a lot of

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,080
things

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,760
for example here uh

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,120
as you i show we do

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:13,200
a website translation

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:16,240
uh dev installer

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:20,000
so uh so you choose something

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:23,760
to to help him and

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,760
and do i make a process to help in this

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,039
when you have has a a process

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,110
and and it's working you can do

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,440
and other things and helping

00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:38,720
[Music]

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,840
in other things too but in

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,360
at least in for the first moment

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:49,840
uh a

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:52,880
tip that i give is to talk for another

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,000
another teams that is has a

00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:00,000
a team that is working to see how

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,200
how this process and talk to

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,200
a 218 team

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,200
to see how to uh

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,960
to put things in debian i don't know

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,720
exactly how

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,760
how this works inside the habit to

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,320
to do an a new a new language inside the

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,520
devil

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,840
but you can talk with this

00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,840
[Music]

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
so

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,799
my recommendation is this

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,520
great so the next question is

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,559
what has been the biggest challenge in

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,679
the

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,000
l-10 portuguese team until now since you

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,000
are in

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,440
for me the biggest challenge is to keep

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,720
people contributing we had a lot of

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,630
people

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,200
coming and going

00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:06,960
[Music]

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,480
as as i say we had a

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,760
difficult flow to contribute especially

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,640
to

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:21,760
websites people don't want to

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:25,279
to use anymore email

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,559
send email like this people

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,760
want things easier but

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:35,360
we know that newer

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,360
things is not

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,159
specialist friendly with as free

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,480
software

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:47,919
so we we know that we have to keep

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,559
some of this all the ways to

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,039
to work but we had we have to improve

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,399
some

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:58,240
some kind of ways to

00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:02,799
to do so

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,919
what a way we are using is

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,960
is to move to git

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:12,240
and which is a possibility

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:16,080
that we are a thing that is

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:20,399
could improve this contribution but we

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:24,559
we have to to make a

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:28,480
a bad test but we we have to

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:31,600
to reduce our job

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:36,720
dependence but before before it

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:39,919
is before this test we had to

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:44,799
reduce our job

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,799
in the uh waiting uh

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
fight

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,600
great our next question have you ever

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,679
thought about

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,600
some other media possible instead of

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,120
emailing to the translation system

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,399
some idea

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:08,720
yes as a

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:12,880
as i say we we are

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,330
thinking about using salsa

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,640
choose git especially to

00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:20,480
[Music]

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:25,120
to website so we will try

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:28,799
to don't use email anymore so

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:32,799
everything you will you you will inside

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:36,000
thousand uh but but we'll have to

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:39,440
try if it's work and with it

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,360
the contribution contributors

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:47,039
robots will work and

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,080
who can can take the contributors

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:54,840
from there and if

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:57,519
this website can can take there

00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:04,159
another way

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:07,440
could be like dtss that is a website

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:11,039
or a web system that

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,559
could web translation

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:17,600
so uh okay that is

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:21,120
good could work but a lot of

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,559
people don't like uh especially

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,760
in our team uh most of people that is

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,480
acting today don't like just

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,480
this kind of

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:38,480
just solution but

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,039
probably to try to

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,840
get new people contribution maybe we

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,440
have

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,080
to to do some new things or

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,960
