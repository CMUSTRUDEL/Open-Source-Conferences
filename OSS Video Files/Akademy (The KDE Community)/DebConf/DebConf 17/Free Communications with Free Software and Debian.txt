	00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:16,449
so who has read Debian's social contract

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:21,999
yes okay so what is the point number

00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:27,960
four in the social contract our users

00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:27,960
yes our users what about our users

00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:42,200
yes that our users and free software

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:46,970
those are our priorities in Debian this

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:50,300
is from the Debian social contract how

00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:53,780
does this compare to the priorities of

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:58,460
corporate app developers and social

00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:13,700
media services what are their priorities

00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:17,600
and profit and yes as shareholders yes

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,659
so the directors of corporations are

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,320
obliged to do what's best for their

00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:27,950
company and for their shareholders not

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,729
their employees not their users not

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,680
what's good for society but their

00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:40,610
obligation is to their corporation and

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:44,300
their new shareholders so what happened

00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:47,030
to MySpace and all the other social

00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,270
media networks that Facebook just came

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:55,630
along and clobbered them all didn't they

00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:58,040
so this chart shows the market share of

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,560
actually the minutes that people spend

00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,200
on social media networks as Facebook

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,390
took over so if you were running another

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,599
social media network or developing

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:13,970
another app and you were one of the

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,330
directors of those companies you'd be

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:21,640
very concerned about your company being

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,019
wiped out just like MySpace or other

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:28,099
operators who just lost all of their

00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:30,560
users to Facebook so would that leave

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:32,659
you tempted to do things to keep the

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,980
attention of your users to interrupt

00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:41,140
them with push messages even to the

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,140
point that you're almost spamming them

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,870
so this is the way it's been working in

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,930
the in the domain of corporate solutions

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:56,540
for free for real-time communications so

00:02:50,930 --> 00:03:00,409
whatsapp viber you know Twitter Facebook

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,860
they're all competing for those for

00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:06,290
every minute you have in the day they're

00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:10,579
competing for your attention for user

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:19,090
engagement and they're interrupting you

00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:21,739
to get it can they get that share of

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,129
people's attention without interrupting

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,129
you

00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:40,020
now people have a soft spot for things

00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:45,210
that are new or unusual has anyone seen

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:47,970
a cat photo recently yeah just about

00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,910
every cat photo is different cat photos

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:54,810
get your attention don't they they say

00:03:50,910 --> 00:04:00,240
that Facebook would be dead within a

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:03,090
week if it wasn't for cats but half the

00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:07,380
people come to Facebook just to see a

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:10,890
new cat photo each day no two cat photos

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,570
are the same people are attracted to

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:17,370
things that are new that are changing

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:21,890
that interesting you know they're doing

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:26,790
something like studying for an exam and

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:29,460
it's boring and then this cat photo pops

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:34,440
up and it just brightens up their whole

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,150
face but it may not be and helping them

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,280
study or whatever they were doing at

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:43,350
that time before they received the new

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:48,030
cat photo and people have a

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:52,440
vulnerability for things that are new or

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,980
unusual and that our brains are wired to

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,380
be and excited by those things and this

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,170
is actually similar to the vulnerability

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,000
we have for fatty foods back in the

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:07,110
caveman days when we were

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,690
hunter-gatherers and it was very hard to

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,480
get a lot of fat in your diet people

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:15,660
would struggle to get the minimum amount

00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,780
of fat in their diet now you can get

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:22,790
more fat in one meal from McDonald's

00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:29,520
then a caveman could get in a whole week

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:32,070
and so the human body is hardwired to

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,750
try and find fat because it used to be

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:38,540
difficult to find and it's the same

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,570
thing with

00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:45,410
the interruptions we get from from our

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:48,350
social media messaging apps and what

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,960
have you that the that our brains react

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,390
to this excitement that something is

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,110
happening and companies like McDonald's

00:05:53,390 --> 00:06:00,710
too huge or even your local fish and

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,320
chip shop and business you know they all

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,800
know that they're selling a product that

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,320
is not healthy that they're appealing to

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,080
this excitement that you have for eating

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,210
fatty foods but they've worked out its

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,800
profitable and they continue to do it

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:21,110
and in the same way many of the

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,440
developers of Communications apps have

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:27,320
worked out that its profitable to keep

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,410
interrupting people just like putting

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,030
chips on their plate they just keep

00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,160
doing it because they've worked out

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,230
they'll end up like MySpace if they

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:42,700
don't you know get keep people's

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:46,160
attention now if you're driving your car

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:48,680
or you're reading a book and you hear

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,480
that you've just got a text message or a

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:56,200
whatsapp message or what have you and do

00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,730
you find that affects your concentration

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,280
can you even finish reading that

00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,950
paragraph in the book without some

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:09,230
difficulty you want to know what was in

00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:13,520
the text message don't you and so

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:19,510
they've actually suggested that knowing

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:22,070
you have a message that you haven't read

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:26,290
has the same impact on your

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,290
concentration as a glass of wine or

00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,210
another why it's been explained is that

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,280
having that message that you haven't

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,440
read sitting there and you know it's

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,950
there you heard the beep but you haven't

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:43,610
looked that it's it's the same as a ten

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:48,550
point drop in your IQ doing certain

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,550
under certain conditions and

00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:02,480
so back to the social contract is it in

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:07,260
the best interests of our users to

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:09,180
interrupt them to put notifications on

00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,640
their screen whether it's on their

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,150
laptop or their desktop or on their

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:22,070
mobile phone you know in a corner of

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:25,140
their web browser as an organization

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,570
Debian is not run like a corporation we

00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,870
don't have a board of directors we're

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:33,240
not regulated like a company and so we

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,900
don't have to chase profits or look out

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,840
for shareholders and we don't have to

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,990
worry about maximizing the number of

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:47,460
minutes that our users spend using

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:51,860
Debbie and each day as anyone ever tried

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:57,120
to count that right okay

00:08:51,860 --> 00:09:00,600
not only that we can design our tools to

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,760
put users in control of their

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,460
communications instead of the

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,060
communications controlling the user the

00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:10,830
user can control their communications

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,980
you see this in with all successful

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:18,120
people and whether it's a politician or

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,980
a rock singer or a sports star you know

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,740
they have two or three people to filter

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,210
all their communications and so they

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,610
don't have to answer questions

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,830
themselves someone else runs their

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,850
Twitter account for them while they're

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:37,140
busy playing golf or going to the beach

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:40,170
well another thing that we can do is we

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,350
can change the default settings in the

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:47,520
applications we distribute to turn off

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:51,690
the notifications if as a community we

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:56,910
value the ability of people to

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:58,800
concentrate and to control their time we

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,030
don't have to interrupt them we can say

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,970
look we'll turn off the notifications

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:07,170
and the people who want them can turn

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:09,060
them on if they need them most are the

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,980
software vendors

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,470
wouldn't dare to try something like that

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,840
but we can do that because we're Debian

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,020
because it's free software and we can

00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:25,860
change it and we can design it with the

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:29,820
user in mind just think about a couple

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,190
of potential users for a moment imagine

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,430
a university student who is trying to

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:38,240
learn the language in there

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,980
memorizing a list of words what impact

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,620
would that glass of wine have on that

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,870
exercise what impact will it have if

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,710
they are getting beeps from their

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,990
computer or their phone you know for

00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,750
memory to work there's a strong link

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,690
between memory and and concentration if

00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,240
their concentration is elsewhere they

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,510
may as well not have even started the

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,460
learning exercise they didn't even need

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,560
to open the book or pick up the list of

00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,180
words because after they've had that

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,960
notification they're not going to

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,360
remember anything anyway

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,180
imagine a software developer who's been

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,530
analyzing a complicated bug like a race

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:24,210
condition or something and their phone

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,370
beeps and they lose their concentration

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,520
and they were just on the verge of

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,590
solving that bug and their concentration

00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,080
has gone out the window and they will

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,430
miss some small detail in the log file

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,230
that would have helped them solve the

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:41,280
problem and now they're going to spend

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:44,760
the next afternoon working on it and so

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:47,610
they've they've lost their time and they

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,810
have to start again these are real

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:54,540
examples of the impact of push

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,640
notifications in all these other pop-ups

00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:02,400
and interruptions from messaging

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:05,190
technologies today so in in Lumi call

00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,870
which is an app that I look after for

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:12,570
Android and one of our outreach interns

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:16,050
and Vico goal who will be arriving

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:20,220
sometime today has experimented with

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:22,900
silent x in the app and so this is just

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,750
one example of something that free soft

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:30,490
can do that no phone company would dare

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:35,370
to dream of and when your phone is not

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:38,279
answered there's no charge for the call

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,589
that's a nightmare for phone companies

00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:44,890
this is why they enable voicemail on

00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:46,750
every new phone because they want to

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,400
know that they can still charge people

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,330
to call you even when you don't answer

00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:55,900
and I say with a silent mode feature an

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:58,570
automatic silent mode that automatically

00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:02,500
stops your phone ringing after a certain

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,180
time every night and you know from the

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,640
phone company's perspective you're

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,700
cutting their revenue they're not going

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,250
to offer you that choice and but free

00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,020
software can give you that choice and so

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,420
avika has developed that and you're

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,730
welcome to try it you're welcome to copy

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:26,470
it into other apps me as free software

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:29,620
lets you do that people often ask me you

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:34,450
know can we make an alternative to Skype

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:36,490
and viber and whatsapp and but we have

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,890
to be careful to think about what that

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,830
alternative will look like we can't just

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:45,670
offer another Skype or another viber

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:49,180
if we try to just do the same things the

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,980
way that the corporation's do them and

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,930
then our service will be

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:58,180
indistinguishable there be no reason for

00:13:52,930 --> 00:14:01,029
users to change over and if you look at

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:04,720
privacy for example even after the

00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:07,089
revelations by Edward Snowden and many

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,880
people still are not motivated to change

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:13,390
who has had a conversation with a friend

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,820
recently about privacy anybody and are

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,970
they still using the same technologies

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:22,540
or have they moved over to free software

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,550
and who's whose friends have tried free

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,580
software for a day or a week and then

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:32,260
they've gone back to something

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:34,900
proprietary yeah privacy has not helped

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,740
people to change their mind about those

00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,740
technologies

00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:44,580
but when some users realize how much

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,860
it's costing them to lose their

00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,200
attention to lose their energy dealing

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,800
with the interruptions from messaging

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:57,270
apps and what have you are we ready

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,980
with a solution for those users when

00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,770
people realize that their children are

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:06,660
not learning at school and they go out

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:09,420
looking for solutions wouldn't that be a

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,630
great place for us to be in to have an

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,300
alternative not just a Skype with a

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,690
different name but a completely

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,880
different way of doing messaging and

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:26,370
real-time communications where the user

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:29,790
is in control so those are some

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:32,850
questions I wanted to raise to get some

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,260
discussion going over this week who's

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,440
going to be here for the rest of the

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,540
week at debconf yeah so there's a lot of

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,630
developers and a lot of people are very

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:46,200
keen on free software and these are

00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:48,870
problems that we can solve and we can

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,460
offer these things to people and so

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,220
these are things we can continue talking

00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,680
about through the week the next thing I

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,810
want to bring up now is to demo some of

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,510
the things we're actually doing today in

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:03,390
Debian things that work for free

00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:05,190
real-time communication and these are

00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:10,170
the things based entirely on free

00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:15,290
software so the first demo we're going

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:15,290
to use the RTC Debian dog service

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:48,369
so who's a Debian developer here yeah

00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:53,019
so who's tried RTC Debian org already

00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:56,529
yep so so a few people so you can log in

00:16:53,019 --> 00:17:01,239
and using a RTC password you actually

00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:03,999
have to go to the LDAP service and set

00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:07,659
up an RTC password there before you can

00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,089
use this site do not use your secure

00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:12,539
SSO passwords or things to try and log

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,539
in here

00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,590
okay so I've logged in and now I can

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:36,220
make and receive calls through my

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:41,170
browser using my Pocock at Debian org

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:44,310
address so we have someone who's

00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,310
hopefully going to call

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,820
let's have a look on IRC we'll know if

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,500
it rings we will hear it it's one of

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,620
those interruptions I've been speaking

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,620
about

00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:35,450
okay if anyone remember which workspace

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,720
I was on one of the problems with WebRTC

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:41,430
is that if you have a lot of tabs open

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,090
and a lot of Windows it can be hard to

00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:48,480
find which one is ringing so we've got

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:51,630
the owner is calling and she's a calling

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,580
from this sip address so she's in the

00:18:51,630 --> 00:19:00,650
Fedora community they have a similar

00:18:53,580 --> 00:19:09,080
service so I'm going to enable that

00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:09,080
hello Jana

00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:20,040
okay so so that's working I'm gonna hang

00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:23,220
up it can you hear me well let me just

00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:29,070
try the sound we don't we tried to hook

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:32,790
this up to the speakers before can you

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:36,140
check your microphone volume and check

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,140
that you are not muted

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,140
you know

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:09,210
now I've got the sound at maximum and

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:19,470
I've only got one output which is wired

00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:22,190
in here to the sound system so yeah so

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,190
that's working

00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:45,250
you can hear me Yona okay let's um try

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,250
changing something and

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:10,570
I'm going to change my webcam so I'm

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,650
going to hang up and then you can call

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,650
then I'll call you

00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,190
it's like the Transformers

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,510
we have to choose the camera here

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:29,390
hello can you see the room we have

00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:38,159
if you wave - Yonah

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:50,330
okay we have communication very good

00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:54,080
Yona is in Tirana in Albania she's one

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,239
of the open labs team they made us very

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:02,149
welcome there at oskol their annual

00:22:56,239 --> 00:23:07,580
conference back in May and Yona is going

00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:10,690
to flock later this month flock is is

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:14,090
anyone here going to flock with fedora

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:16,279
yeah so they have a similar service it's

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:20,330
actually based on the same code just

00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:22,269
with their Fedora logo so hopefully

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,139
we'll be able to establish more

00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:28,580
communication between different

00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:32,659
distributions using web RTC so we'll try

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:35,179
the jitsi meet now so jitsi meet is

00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:38,239
another solution you can have more than

00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:42,320
two people in a call so I'm gonna hang

00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:46,129
up again and if we're lucky we might

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:51,919
even get audio with jitsi meet Fiona

00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:56,049
we're going to jitsi mate actually go

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,049
and find the URL

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,490
what was that

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,330
it's a notification

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:27,100
who is that you've you've proven my

00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,100
point yeah thank you

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:42,230
okay so now we're in jitsi meet hello so

00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:45,500
what we could do is somebody else could

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:50,410
try and join this session as well using

00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,410
the URL can you hear me Yona

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:10,030
it's this URL can you read that at the

00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:10,030
back no and I'll put the URL on the IRC

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:53,889
oh here we go so so it's working for

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,889
somebody yep okay

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:12,440
who else is joining us I don't know

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:19,760
what's happening here with the sound I

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:19,760
could try we got feedback

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,450
hello

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:38,340
you can hear me okay I'm gonna try

00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:39,750
unplugging the amplifier and see if we

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,560
can hear people through my laptop

00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:56,150
speakers which will probably not be loud

00:26:43,560 --> 00:27:02,510
enough to fill the room Yona you know No

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:02,510
can you say something can you hear me

00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,539
hello

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,540
okay

00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:26,119
can you hear me

00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,260
no I don't think we're hearing anyone

00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,770
else coming back through the speakers

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:39,790
here so I don't know exactly where the

00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,790
sound is gone

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,370
I can check that yeah

00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:32,930
yeah

00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:35,590
so there's also a bit of feedback with

00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,590
latency

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,779
there are far too many options in the

00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:53,169
pulseaudio

00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:55,440
so when you go into the jitsi mate you

00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:59,039
can put your name in there somewhere

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,039
thank you there is some

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:15,710
so fellow JIT stir and you can add your

00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,710
name and we've got

00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:27,540
okay that wasn't me that was fate back

00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,540
again spend that time

00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:41,090
okay so there are exciting possibilities

00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:45,320
with jitsi meters whatever's going wrong

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:47,090
because the it didn't work from either

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,489
of those pages so there's probably

00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:52,129
something I've done in my sound settings

00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:54,259
in my laptop that has stopped it working

00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:57,769
which is not unusual because I'm often

00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:59,960
tweaking these things I tested it

00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:01,730
earlier today and it was okay but maybe

00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,730
I've changed something when I was

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:07,159
connecting up to the projector and so

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,049
I'd like to encourage people to try both

00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:13,179
of these things if you're a Debian

00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:16,789
developer yeah please register with the

00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:19,159
RTC Debian org and try calling other

00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:24,249
people in the community or ask people to

00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:28,940
call you and anyone can go to jitsi meet

00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:32,840
also try that out and and you know share

00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:36,049
the results using the Debian RTC mailing

00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,419
list if you have questions there are

00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:40,429
people there who can answer them and the

00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:45,639
next thing we're going to move on to now

00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:48,559
is ring so who has already heard of ring

00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:52,730
so many people so ring is is

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:55,970
peer-to-peer so there's no central

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:58,549
server like with web RTC so I'm going to

00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:00,859
invite Alex and dureena from

00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:06,909
savoir-faire Linux they're part of the

00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:10,340
team behind ring yep

00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:12,940
Sebastian yep you can come up as well so

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,940
come and join us

00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,690
okay so

00:31:51,460 --> 00:32:00,089
you'll need a microphone it's very and

00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:00,089
if you

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:10,920
so ring

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:14,460
is completely new it's a peer-to-peer

00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:17,790
solution so alex is going to explain

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:20,070
more about what it does and why this is

00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:22,770
different if you've got f-droid you can

00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:25,190
try and download or Google Play as well

00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:30,210
you can download it on your phone while

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:32,130
while it's been explained so okay so I'm

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,050
an exam I'm from the ring team and I'm

00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,810
Deb in developer I happen to be

00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:39,720
maintaining ring and Debian actually we

00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:42,300
have recent version of rings in indigent

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,260
backports but a bit older in they've

00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:48,570
been stable and very recent and unstable

00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:51,360
so what the ring is it's it's a fully

00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,820
distributed communications platform so

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,220
I'm not saying centralized I'm not

00:32:53,820 --> 00:33:00,150
saying federated I'm saying distributed

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:02,670
so just just like just like BitTorrent

00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:05,490
magnet links works they did it works the

00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:07,590
work using DHT we do the same thing with

00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,660
ring so when you use ring you're not

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:12,300
trusting any entity to reading messages

00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,730
you're really like using a fully

00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:17,880
distributed service so it comes with it

00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,710
comes with some downsides such as like

00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,300
messages can take up to one or two

00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:23,760
seconds to get to the to the other

00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,820
participant and things like that but

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,300
mostly we have if we don't have it

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:32,550
already we have solutions for most like

00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,770
RTC problems as you can see though on my

00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:37,440
client right now okay I can see that

00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,750
I view is online so we have presence

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,150
which is a very special for a

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,820
distributed service and we also have

00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,760
user names they did this this guy here

00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,290
he is called a vo and this is a

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,570
registered user name in the in a

00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,670
distributed service so this is a this is

00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:56,310
problem problems we have solved with

00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:58,260
ring - we are making use of blockchain

00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:02,940
technology just like Bitcoin is to

00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:06,950
register user names and I'm gonna make a

00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,950
call to show you what it looks like

00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:16,960
this is what we call a ring ID ringer ID

00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:19,180
are not really not really convenient to

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,700
to share with people but I don't know

00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,700
the user name of this of this user Oh

00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,530
I'm gonna call someone else then

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,329
ring also has some useful useful

00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,400
features such as delivery reports so

00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:12,130
when you when you send messages even

00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,010
though it goes through a a fully

00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,510
distributed server it's um you have

00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,819
delivery reports so you can know whether

00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,349
or not here your contact has received a

00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:25,410
message you don't see my full screen I'm

00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:25,410
gonna resize the window here

00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:48,200
all right yeah I'm calling to my my cell

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:50,130
phone with my laptop yeah so I can yeah

00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:55,280
yeah I'm gonna give it to do you know

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:58,200
did anyone else download it onto Android

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,960
yes so we have apps for for most

00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:05,160
platforms including Android and some non

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,290
free platforms we have we have clients

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,599
for everything

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:12,089
ring-ring is still is we still we still

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:16,020
considering a very early software so you

00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:20,160
can you can expect bugs but that that's

00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:22,020
what they start with us oh yeah we also

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,750
have useful features such as multi

00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,150
device so when you call it when you call

00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,339
a ring user it's going to ring on all of

00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:32,430
its devices and adding a new device is

00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:36,020
as simple of as entering a pin and your

00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:38,549
password we still we still struggle with

00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:41,040
with met with many concepts that we have

00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:42,450
to fight that people are used to for

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,220
example when you create a ring account

00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,160
some time we have users coming back to

00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:49,200
us and asking how come I can't login on

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,210
my on my new device so just with my

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,980
login password well no that's not how it

00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,700
works you have to transfer actually your

00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:58,260
your certificate to the new device so

00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,910
concepts like this don't apply to ring

00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,980
because it's fully distributed you can't

00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,369
just login on a new laptop and expect it

00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,920
to work

00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:08,339
you really have to transfer files from

00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,280
one computer to another but we try to

00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:12,900
make it as easy as possible to to

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,650
simplify all concept and feedback from

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:19,980
the community will also help especially

00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:24,960
from from users that do not understand

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:27,730
the concepts behind distributed services

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,530
yeah and we do have a talk about about

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:31,360
ringer in a few hours so if you're

00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,530
interested into more detailed as to how

00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:38,620
it works please come yes

00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:41,200
so 6:00 p.m. which target can you hear

00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:43,600
me okay so it would be a it will be at

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,220
6:00 p.m. in the body room so we were

00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,820
all invited if you are interested on

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:50,980
honoring thank you okay so we've got

00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:55,060
about maybe five minutes for questions

00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:58,270
and so does anyone have questions and

00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:02,650
you need the microphone do you undertake

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:04,950
the microphone out to people and who has

00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,950
a question

00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:17,550
can i up get install ring yeah and the

00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:19,680
package is called ring I suggest to you

00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,450
the one in backwards so please enable

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,800
backwards on your machine but if you if

00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,180
you're running on stable or whatever

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,599
you're gonna have a recent version oh

00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,670
okay

00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,619
yeah thank you we also have repositories

00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:31,400
for all these rows for those of you guys

00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:38,930
that are not using Dagon for some reason

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:38,930
okay so next question okay

00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,560
so you

00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,170
yeah okay so you said it's peer-to-peer

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,270
but I do understand it correctly that

00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,400
there is a server in the middle no

00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:54,020
there's absolutely no server well the

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,910
the way the way peer-to-peer networks

00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,790
work usually is you have to know at

00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:01,490
least one node to join the network so we

00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:04,550
run what we call a bootstrap node at

00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:06,380
bootstrap bring that CX but like if if

00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,050
you did not want your client to connect

00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,370
to this node at when it first boots you

00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:13,270
could put your friend's IP and it's

00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:15,800
gonna work it's it's fully distributed

00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,960
there's one thing though is when when

00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,110
code to not work so for example there

00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,640
are situations where both people are

00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:25,970
both peers are behind the firewall that

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,500
they do not control it's impossible to

00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,060
establish a connection between the two

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,590
users right because they don't they

00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,410
don't have a UPnP and they are both

00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:36,800
behind the firewall ring will will

00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:38,960
revert to using turn servers but this is

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,060
like a last a last resort thing and we

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,890
host turn servers for the community to

00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,600
use so when you install a ring it's

00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,640
pre-configured with a server that it

00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,580
hosts that it that is hosted by sabah

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:55,520
unix so you are almost assured that

00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:58,670
every call will work at all times if

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,950
what the two servers and w2 the if the

00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,680
turn server is is not a ring thing like

00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,080
it's it's it's a fully open protocol we

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,480
have three turn server packages in

00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,180
debian so people can run their own turn

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,670
server if they don't want to use the

00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:16,220
turn server provided by the ring

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,830
developers so ring does not invent many

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,540
things like we use s IP we use turn

00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:26,330
servers all of those protocols we

00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:30,320
haven't invented we have another

00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:35,720
question do you have any plans for

00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:39,380
making an iPhone and iPhone app did you

00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,860
say that yes we do have a work in

00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,710
progress

00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,570
iPhone app it's it's the only it's it's

00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,750
almost the only platform that we haven't

00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,820
released on yet it's working so you can

00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:52,850
you can build from source if that's what

00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:56,180
you want but it's it's not in the store

00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:58,300
and there are issues with that too thank

00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,300
you

00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:06,140
any more questions

00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:09,260
okay very good and I say yeah thank you

00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:11,150
everybody for coming and thank you Alex

00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:14,420
and the emcee for inviting a string team

00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:16,520
for demonstrating that and thank you to

00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,800
your owner for joining us remotely I'm

00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,840
sorry we could not hear you and I'm sure

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,640
this was my fault and not yours and so

00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:28,010
please do you know feel free to approach

00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,280
us and test things with us while we're

00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:34,670
here and is even for problems like this

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,500
with the WebRTC there's no better place

00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,240
to test these things and iron out the

00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,270
bugs than when you're standing up in

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,370
front of a room of people but the second

00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,630
best place to test the things and iron

00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,620
out the bugs is when you're meeting

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:50,120
people here at an event like Def Con and

00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:52,760
so if you're trying these things and

00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,170
they're not working for you you know sit

00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,020
down with me and we can have a look at

00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:59,390
it together even if I can get some more

00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,430
data to file a bug report and we can fix

00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,050
it in the future that's one of the

00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,510
things that makes an event like this

00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:09,560
really productive so had welcome any
