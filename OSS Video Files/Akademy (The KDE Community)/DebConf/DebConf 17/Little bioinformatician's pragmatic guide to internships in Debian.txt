	00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:14,230
and welcome well we are here today to

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,820
show you some effort of the outreach G

00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,050
program who knows the alternative

00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:25,720
program good the other ones are here for

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:29,409
bioinformatics right no okay well um the

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,239
thing is okay the things in the Debian

00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:34,570
MIT team has a lot of biological

00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:39,820
packages and we are not really sure

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:42,730
and as tatiana and that i have proven it

00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,920
was we were really we could be sure that

00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,690
not all our packages are working

00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,030
correctly because they have written

00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,230
tests they've written out of the AG

00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,410
tests which is a very valuable job and

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,690
both of them did very good

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:03,609
unfortunately tatiana can't come but not

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:08,280
i want to present some of her work and I

00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:12,549
asked her to present on one side

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,290
technical works biological stuff which I

00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,750
really appreciate because I'm a

00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,790
physicist I have no idea about biology

00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,070
and I'm happy that she is doing things I

00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:24,189
couldn't do and on once on the other

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,799
side she should give some introduction

00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:31,090
into the internship into the area

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,399
because because for my for my opinions

00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,219
even more important that we get new

00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,829
person to our teams I'm always trying to

00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:41,860
get new fresh blood and thanks to the

00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:44,079
ultra cheap program we have people doing

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,329
the work and we have people who might

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,880
remain in the Debian project which is

00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:51,430
really interesting for us so and now I

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,479
have a pleasure to follow the talk of

00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,789
Nadia and wish you good luck Thanks

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,789
hello my name is Nadia and I am a little

00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:03,520
beyond fermentation unfortunately

00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:07,659
another after wasn't able to make it

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:12,280
here at the Tiana but I will speak for

00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:15,849
both of us so by informatics is a

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,670
scientific field which combines computer

00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:23,170
science

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:26,480
mathematics to analyze biological data

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:30,220
my specializations is mostly genomics

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,959
and genomic simply and the Tiana's

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:38,720
specialization is better omics and

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:41,930
structural biology there are hundreds of

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,739
packages in Debian which are related to

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:51,050
by informatics and the goal of my

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:58,880
internship is to improve quality of

00:02:51,050 --> 00:03:00,860
these packages by writing tests as far

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,380
as I know there are two types of

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:08,690
internships in Debian its google Summer

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:11,900
of Code and outreach there as same but

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:16,160
there are some differences for example

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:20,600
there are much more projects available

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:24,590
for google Summer of Code but it happens

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:30,470
only once a year while outreach happens

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:35,239
twice a year and google Summer of Code

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:38,750
is available only for students which

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:42,980
enrolled to some program while outreach

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:47,260
is available for people from under

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,260
underrepresented groups such as women

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:58,670
unfortunately outreach isn't so popular

00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,160
as google Summer of Code and not many

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:05,120
people knows about it

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,390
I'm personally learned it by friend who

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:16,039
knows someone who knows someone who

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:18,260
participated and it's sad because there

00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:22,160
are a lot of people who graduated and

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:25,010
they are looking for internship but most

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,530
internships available only for students

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:31,790
and all three she is

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,670
good choice for me it was a perfect

00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,460
choice because I was looking for a job

00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,350
for a year and I couldn't find anything

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:43,250
because I didn't have much experience

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,590
and when I'm trying to find internship I

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:50,750
couldn't qualify because it wasn't a

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:55,120
student anymore and outreach helped me

00:04:50,750 --> 00:05:00,410
to overcome a first contribution anxiety

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,260
because at first I was afraid to make

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:08,210
some to make something wrong or ask

00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:12,950
silly questions and three cheer helps to

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:17,330
overcome these problems and also why I

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:19,610
liked this project because it really

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,840
makes difference for band fermentations

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,080
because i know my friends biologic

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,870
biologists they struggle with

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:33,440
informatics often because it's almost

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:39,580
always bugging it doesn't run from the

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:43,220
first time and they feel frustration and

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:47,090
often they just drop the idea to use the

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:50,870
tool and they write their own scripts

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:53,390
and this is a wasting of time so I think

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:58,669
the improving the quality of packages is

00:05:53,390 --> 00:06:04,930
important here's some examples of our

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:08,539
work what we learned this was a story

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:13,700
when I was testing fast extol CAD

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:16,340
package and I did it work and then I

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:24,080
asked community and figured out that

00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:26,150
there was undocumented option yeah when

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:33,200
I figured out this the problem was

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:36,660
solved another case is when I skipped

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:42,840
system requirements and was trying to

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:49,590
test package which actually needed 75

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:53,610
gigabytes of RAM of course it was a

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:58,260
better location on my computer but then

00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:02,370
I figured out there was an option to

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:08,280
make mini database and run on my

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:13,410
computer this is an example of Danny's

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:20,430
work when she worked and met a student

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:25,040
package she find out that dependency

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:29,700
changed from legacy blast blast plus and

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:35,790
the output of plus plus was different

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:42,750
from legacy blast so she needed to look

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:47,040
for all usage of blast blast plus in the

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:57,920
meta student and change it to parts

00:07:47,040 --> 00:08:02,340
correctly at the output also we used the

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:07,440
barrel PAC package which helps to write

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:13,320
tests for barrel packages and it was an

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:16,710
example of good legacy and also I wanted

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:21,660
to say some words about my mentor

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:23,940
Andres we like to work with him very

00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,290
much because he always answer it answer

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:33,120
it on time

00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:37,250
he was always supportive and I'm very

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:42,560
shy person and he pushed me out of my

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,560
zone of comfort you also make me shy now

00:08:44,930 --> 00:09:06,800
Thanks anybody have a question once so

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:11,100
answer ask the first question

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:16,020
if not I have some additions because if

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:20,100
I compare my experience with google

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:22,680
Summer of Code students which you all if

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,620
some of course students were men they

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,490
were frequently not that busy as women

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:33,120
so I've better experiences with Tatiana

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:35,460
and you and had also another women in

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,560
the google Summer of Code they are doing

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,380
a very good technical work to my

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,230
experience and it was very good

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,650
communication between us so this is I

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:51,630
can really recommend to run this out

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:54,240
Sochi program and what I would like to

00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:57,330
give as a hint for mint his mentor's

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,480
it's when Tatiana said I was responsive

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,820
I have kind of a priority of myself is

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,890
if somebody is waiting for an answer for

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,190
me then this is his highest priority

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,870
I've always has to do everybody has

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,350
tasks to do but if somebody's waiting

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,260
for you

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,080
please don't let people wait to keep

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:20,490
their motivation higher this is kind of

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,890
important thing and so I hope it's it's

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:28,940
in our team the culture is that way and

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:28,940
I can just recommend this so and

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,970
according to there's actually checking

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,100
technical work

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:41,340
I remember at least two packages we are

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:43,920
not yet spotted some several mistakes I

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,810
made in the packaging so this was really

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,420
cool because I suppose this is what we

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:53,080
need we need people who are doing as for

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,200
ice workflow

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,120
if it's an intern or not but this is

00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:03,100
kind of important thing and people

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:05,019
should be kind of bold because I'm kind

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,750
of an established a beyond developer and

00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:10,570
I'm quite known but I make as many

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:14,050
mistakes as everybody else so please

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:17,230
check us and this is a good thing of

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:19,660
interns because they come without pre

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,310
trusses and do their job and that are

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,700
really did a good job as well I start

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:28,209
yawning unfortunately can come it is

00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:34,420
triggered more questions now or the

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:39,610
education I think we've start with the

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:43,029
question in the back and then it's a

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:46,420
personal question has this internship

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:49,680
motivated you to spend more time on

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:54,070
Debian like now in your free time I

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:57,790
never was a man but I don't know how to

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,709
compare but yes I feel that I'm

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:04,029
responsible for this task and I'm

00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:21,130
responsible for future attendees so they

00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:25,029
will have the chance okay Summer of Code

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:27,880
and now twitchy is that in outreach you

00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:30,040
can only participate once as far as I

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,529
know and for google Summer of Code you

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,510
can participate twice if I'm not

00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:40,540
mistaken but having said that I have

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:42,790
also been an Outreach Center this winter

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:47,020
and I found the experience really great

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:50,530
and it did motivate me to stay with

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:54,550
and for to involve more stable people

00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:56,650
there's Debian teams and so I can double

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,950
the world so that this is a great

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:03,990
experience and it really helps you to

00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:10,840
come into the underworld Thanks

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:13,720
there's a question here thanks a my

00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,150
question I guess is quite simple and I

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,540
know that I cannot generalize for from a

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:23,860
specific answer but well these programs

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:27,210
are meant to not only to get put like a

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:30,430
one-time participation but to a foster

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:33,610
young people getting you involved in the

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:38,170
project do you do you as a person or

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:40,600
have other of your mentors will continue

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,690
to work in the project after after this

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,840
experience what would you say about this

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,670
they say the retention rate or the the

00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:57,700
success of these programs beyond the

00:13:48,670 --> 00:14:00,220
person okay well I realized that despite

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,610
my hopes that the google Summer of Code

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,130
students would continue they did not

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,550
really continued on the topic there's

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,800
one exception the super Singh who went

00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,530
into this was my field school Summer of

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,330
Code student who went into davian's

00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:20,950
organization of google Summer of Code to

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:23,020
get other students in unfortunately the

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:27,780
other students did not really remain but

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:31,510
it's maybe not such a bad thing because

00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:33,580
you say finish sale study and find a job

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,290
and then have some spare time say oh

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,570
there was this project a B and it was

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,290
cool to stay and maybe they come back

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,070
later

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:44,250
so I'm I do not want to draw a final

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:48,150
line here I know this question I

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:51,820
personally really like to mentor people

00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:55,750
be it for for this official program we

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:58,400
have also in official programs in Debian

00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:02,820
made and from this experience I say

00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:05,240
well not 50% but close below 50% of the

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:16,170
people are mentoring are staying inside

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:18,750
which is quite a good quote I think and

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,870
by the way this was also my motivation

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,000
to to push not yaoi to come here and

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:27,300
hold the talk because it was not really

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
so happy but I think it's it's important

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,800
to learn the feeling to present your

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,500
stuff here and that conf because I told

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,970
you also our friends and you need to

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,370
meet your friends somehow this is

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:42,780
easiest and now it everybody knows you

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:44,480
and talk to you it's lunch you know also

00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:53,030
this is also important to you

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:53,030
my girls mining literate everybody else

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:03,780
who wants to join the day we are made

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:06,690
team after this talk you don't say yes

00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:10,830
but maybe you do it with odd thing is

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:12,960
I'm always at try to attract people who

00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,360
could be helpful even if they are doing

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:20,550
just a small part in our team that's

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:24,150
always become the question please wait

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:30,120
for the middle hi do you have a favorite

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:31,880
Debian science package or how about was

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,130
the one that was the least troublesome

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:38,880
no actually it was a package that I

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:44,070
didn't throw the test but I tried to

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:51,810
find the back in BBA me anyway yes it's

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:56,910
like aligning to VW and there was a bag

00:16:51,810 --> 00:17:00,480
which I was looking for a week and it

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:02,400
was very cool to find it well this is

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,040
actually understatement what's she

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,680
usually is doing it was one of my

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,569
colleagues had one data set which was

00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:15,449
crushing under certain circumstances and

00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:17,939
well I wrote an issue on the back

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,380
tracker of PWA and they said that the

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,449
part we should care for it and then it

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:25,589
was silence and then I tried to the

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:27,990
pocket and it kind of really fitted in

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,810
my mighty job it was really one work one

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,840
week of work it was and I hadn't this

00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:36,900
week and so maybe I'm also not so

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,620
skilled in debugging and and finally I

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:43,080
thought well we have this skilled young

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,720
woman in our team just solve this top on

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,090
her and it's actually not the main task

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,030
to find this box it's the main task is

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:53,820
to write tests and that charted in I'm

00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:57,230
really happy about this so this was

00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,230
really cool job thank you

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,310
any further questions

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,790
so you mentioned that outreach she

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,460
helped you get over the the first

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,890
contribution anxiety but I would suspect

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,410
that our Chi we didn't do a perfect job

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,330
at that that's one of the most important

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,340
things that out when she does so how can

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:33,470
outreach you do that even better than we

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:40,880
do it now maybe providing the example

00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:44,690
like some sort of how to do it because

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:48,320
at first the the only problem is the

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:56,090
fear that you do something wrong and I

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:59,540
think the support and that when people

00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:06,620
say you that it's okay to make a mistake

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:09,650
this is important maybe making me out to

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:13,960
be more popular it worked they are a

00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:16,760
friend of your friend an defendants

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:21,500
Tatyana not aware friends before and if

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:25,760
I not had mentored Tatiana first not

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:29,570
able to be there so it should be in non

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,540
interrupted chain of persons working

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:40,750
with us and then maybe get more people I

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:44,930
think no questions I think we also got

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:49,130
20 meter how is this it's finished okay

00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:51,400
okay then let's thank again thank you

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,400
very much

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,140
