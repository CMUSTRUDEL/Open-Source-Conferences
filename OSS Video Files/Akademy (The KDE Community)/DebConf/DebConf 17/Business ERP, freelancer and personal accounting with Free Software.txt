all around the world the terminology is

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,890
is different in each language but it

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,390
means the same thing who uses an

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:57,290

you ok

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:16,250
and who supports solutions like this for

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,370
other businesses as part of their job

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,920
does anyone do consulting around

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:29,900
accounting software or installing

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:32,360
software for accounting ok so some

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,360
people have never used an accounting

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,100
system before so maybe I just ask you is

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,769
there anyone who hasn't used

00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,739
double-entry accounting software would

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:47,030
you maybe put up your hand yep so we've

00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:48,980
got a few people okay so I'll go through

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,160
a couple of very basic things quite

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,010
quickly just to bring you up to speed on

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,799
what we're trying to do and then I'll go

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,530
through a demo of a couple of the

00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:07,430
products we have in Debian and why it's

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:11,750
important using them from Debian there

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:14,420
are two aims of this talk and the first

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,829
is to actually show that that using an

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:21,049
accounting system will improve your

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:25,310
control over your finances whether it's

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:28,549
your personal investments or whether

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,260
it's freelancing and invoicing your

00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:32,389
customers or whether it's running a

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,600
business that using one of these systems

00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:41,269
will improve the way that you manage the

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:44,239
money and and the other aim is to show

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:47,959
you that the best choice you can make is

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,530
to use free software for your accounting

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,810
system so that means a free software

00:03:51,530 --> 00:04:00,799
accounting solution running on a free

00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:04,370
operating system like Debian so people

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,040
like to categorize things in fact

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,700
research in in neuroscience and

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,450
psychology and demonstrates that if we

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,139
don't organize things by categorizing

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,629
them and other technique

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,539
and then it can have all kinds of

00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:25,620
negative effect so stress and anxiety

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:31,110
and being disorganized and not being

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,249
able to make good decisions and so who's

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,840
been to Ikea

00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:38,909
do you have IKEA here in Montreal and

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,120
it's like a giant maze you go in there

00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:44,629
for a couple of hours and and you can

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,159
come out with a wardrobe like this and

00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:50,090
this is a catch you have to build it

00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:54,840
yourself and so this provides a good

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:57,389
analogy with accounting software but

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,099
using the Wardrobe you can sort things

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,439
into groups you can put your shirts

00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:04,409
together in one place you can put your

00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,180
socks in another place and then you

00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:09,389
might have a couple of unusual things

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,839
like you can see the the hats and the

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:16,669
teddy bears stuffed away in two corners

00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:19,080
up at the top of the Wardrobe and these

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,969
problems you also have in accounting you

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,189
will have unusual transactions that you

00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:25,259
don't know where to put them but some of

00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:27,270
the techniques for organizing those

00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:34,099
accounts are very similar to organizing

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:42,229
a wardrobe who's been to Las Vegas

00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:45,839
casino how much is the black chip worth

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:48,349
1,000 it depends on the casino yeah it

00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,689
can be a hundred or a thousand its son

00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:54,379
can you tell me at a glance how many

00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:57,419
black chips there are in that picture

00:05:54,379 --> 00:06:01,379
and it's not so easy and there might be

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:04,589
a few hidden underneath have you noticed

00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:07,169
in the casino the people stack their

00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:10,469
chips and they group them by the color

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,259
and so this is what categorizing things

00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:15,659
is all about it's it's much easier to

00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,659
see at a glance how much money you've

00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:22,229
got the casino makes the chips in the

00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:24,659
different colors because colors make it

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:27,120
very easy to do this and they could just

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:28,560
write the values on the face but then

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
you wouldn't be able to see them in a

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,610
pile so they color them

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,760
as well it makes everything go a lot

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:41,070
more quickly so if Financial Accounting

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,130
is much the same as picking up all the

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:51,750
clothes and off the floor and getting

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:54,300
them into the wardrobe in finance one of

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:59,430
the most significant categories we use

00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:01,530
is the account and so when you start

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,510
setting up a accounting system you'll

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,240
one of the first things you'll do is to

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,840
set up a chart of accounts so I've

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,300
created a very basic one here and each

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,750
transaction that you make like paying a

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,300
bill writing a check receiving some

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,419
money each transaction can be

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,160
categorized by associating it with an

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:26,070
account it's just like putting it into

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,440
one of the drawers or the hangers in

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:32,060
your wardrobe is you associate it with

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:35,880
one of these accounts the accounts

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,550
themselves can be categorized we can say

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,729
that an account is an asset account or a

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,330
liability account it can be an income

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:47,010
account or an expense account and we

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,620
also have what we call an equity account

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:55,440
so these are the five main categories

00:07:49,620 --> 00:08:02,550
for the accounts and can anyone see a

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:05,190
trend in this chart of accounts so is

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:09,360
there something that you notice looking

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:13,860
at this list of accounts expenses what

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,419
do you notice a lot of expenses yes so

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,680
when you set up your chart of accounts

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:22,200
it's not uncommon to have more expense

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,150
accounts than all the other types of

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,060
account combined whether you're doing

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:32,669
your personal finances or running a

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:34,409
business and this is quite common and so

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,169
just looking at some of those accounts

00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:39,830
we have a current account which

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,460
represents you know a bank account a

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,620
relationship we have with a bank

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:48,320
accounts receivable that represents

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,840
money that people have to pay us so if

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,450
you're freelancing and you give a bill

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,270
to your customer then until they give

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,550
you that money it's categorized in the

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,650
accounts receivable account when you

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:04,070
receive the money it's in your bank

00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:06,080
account you can see a couple of

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,060
liability accounts we've got a credit

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,910
card and we've got an Accounts Payable

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,080
like account so the accounts payable is

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:18,530
the opposite of the accounts receivable

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,350
and then we go through the income from

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,300
consulting account and a number of

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,390
ordinary expenses for rent

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:31,690
telephone insurance most people have

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:35,000
seen these types of expenses before and

00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:37,940
so once we start processing transactions

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,680
and putting them into the system the

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,990
place where they end up is called the

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,250
general ledger so think of it as like a

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:49,850
big spreadsheet or a big database table

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:54,560
and in the general ledger and we can

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:57,530
input our bills and the payments we make

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,800
to pay the bills the income we receive

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:04,610
from other people and we can record the

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,250
the categories that we associate those

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,090
things with or the accounts so in this

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:14,030
first example you've got a transaction

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:16,280
with a date the 5th of August and and

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,910
I've specified two accounts the

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,760
telephone expense account and the

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,980
accounts payable and now this is a

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,280
double entry accounting system so you've

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:33,650
got a debit and a credit that equal the

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:39,070
same amount and and what this does is it

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:41,450
records that we now have a debt for 50

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:45,950
Canadian dollars for example it could be

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:48,650
50 euros or 50 US dollars and in the

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,900
accounts payable and the reason we have

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,650
that debt is because we received a

00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,650
telephone bill

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:05,050
so here's another transaction let's say

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:09,070
at the end of the month we pay that bill

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:11,560
using cash from the current account so

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:15,910
we create another transaction and in

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:19,690
that second transaction we eliminate the

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:22,959
debt in the accounts payable account and

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:26,740
and then we reduce the balance of the

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,769
current account by that same amount so

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,540
once again the debits on one side and

00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:36,010
the credits on the other side of that

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:38,110
transaction are equal so if you add up

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,690
everything in the debit column in the

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,639
credit column they should always be the

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:46,990
same even when you have millions of

00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:50,800
transactions in your system so a final

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,990
example and is a bank fee so in this

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,720
case the bank fee doesn't go through the

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,390
accounts payable the bank just takes the

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,440
money out of your bank account so the

00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:07,510
bank fees account is an expense account

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:09,040
and that's a debit of $2 and the the

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:17,550
amount is taken out of your current

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:20,230
account so that's a credit for $2 so an

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:22,959
accounting system is much like any other

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,750
software you can talk about it in terms

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,970
of inputs and outputs so all these

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,060
little transactions are the inputs and

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:36,069
and the outputs that we get from that

00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:37,959
system reports and you know a summary of

00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:40,120
which bills you have to pay at the end

00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,250
of the month for example or a list of

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,430
which customers have not paid you

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:48,610
already and a balance sheet that shows

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,699
how profitable you've been or how

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,709
successful you are and so those are the

00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:55,300
reports that we get out so by putting in

00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:59,100
all these transactions we'll be able to

00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,100
get those reports very very easily

00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,279
now it doesn't require a lot of math one

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,589
thing you might have noticed is that a

00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,329
lot of these transactions that I've

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:19,559
shown you already are quite simple

00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:23,009
almost boring and one of the main themes

00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:25,649
in accounting and can be summarized by

00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:29,910
this simple equation that your assets

00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:34,949
should be equal to your liabilities plus

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:37,889
equity so this is really basic math

00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:39,870
there's not there's no calculus or

00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:44,309
statistics or anything that you need to

00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:48,809
master accounting so looking at your

00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:52,019
personal finances and if you have a

00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:55,709
house as an asset and the liability

00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:59,100
might be the mortgage and the equity you

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:01,439
have in the house is your it may be your

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,050
net worth or your savings for your

00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:06,779
retirement and so it's the same equation

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,620
and so that's an example with some

00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:12,949
numbers in this case your house is worth

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:16,470
$200,000 and you have a mortgage of

00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:21,689
100,000 so you have equity of 100,000 as

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:23,370
well and here I've taken those figures

00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:26,670
and I've put them into a balance sheet

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:32,309
and is there anyone who has not seen a

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:35,329
balance sheet before okay so the balance

00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:37,920
sheet is based on that same equation and

00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:42,000
so you've got your assets your

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,939
liabilities and your equity and they all

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,660
add up the liabilities and equity have

00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:54,720
added up to 200,000 the same as the

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:57,230
assets on the balance sheet so a couple

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,670
of years ago I wrote a blog post

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:03,929
comparing some of the free software

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:06,889
solutions for accounting mainly on on

00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:11,399
debian and other Linux distributions and

00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:13,319
can you read that at the back no well

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,940
don't worry it's on my blog this this

00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:18,900
table has been cut and pay

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:21,240
from my blog and and I'll just read the

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:24,410
names of the packages I've compared I

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,720
won't go through every box in this table

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:33,030
so we've got post books

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:37,310
Tritan your new cash ledger SMB their

00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:42,750
home bank Scrooge K my money

00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:45,000
BG finances and gree RB or a Grisby it's

00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,400
a bit difficult to read even up here so

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,830
these some most of these are actually

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,720
packaged as well they're all free

00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,000
software you can download the source

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,980
code and most of them you can even

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,420
install them with a package and start

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:02,610
using them in two to three minutes and

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,730
some of the things I've compared in the

00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,760
table whether or not they have a GUI so

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,740
that's the first row in the table

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:14,220
whether they have a web interface is the

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,670
second row in the table and whether or

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,610
not they're a multi-user system and

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:24,690
whether they store data in files or in a

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:28,380
sequel back end like Postgres whether

00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:30,750
they support multi currency and some of

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,030
them support the accounts receivable and

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,480
accounts payable some of them don't if

00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:38,310
you're only tracking your personal

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,410
finances like investments and things you

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,510
might not worry about accounts

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,060
receivable but if you're a freelancer

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:47,700
you will need accounts receivable so

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,230
I've basically compared most of those

00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,120
features there are a few other things

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,120
that you can look at in the blog

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:02,800
yeah so when you look at something like

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:05,209
this wardrobe um

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,140
there's quite a lot of effort in

00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:11,179
actually going into the IKEA store

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,179
walking around comparing like a hundred

00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:15,829
different wardrobes they have on display

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:18,010
loading it onto the trolley taking it

00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:20,929
through the cash register taking at home

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:24,260
then you've got to put it together as

00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:26,780
well and so it's a big effort it's the

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:30,650
same thing with setting up an accounting

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:36,559
system and who set up their accounting

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:42,410
system themselves yep and how much time

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:50,990
did it take you to long okay like half a

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:54,590
day a day weeks yep a day or two yeah

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:59,750
and who has actually changed from one

00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:05,600
accounting system to another yes and how

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:11,919
long did that take it's still going on

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:15,320
yes this is not uncommon they say yeah

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,000
setting up a accounting system it is

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,090
more complicated than building the

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,309
Wardrobe and because you've got to take

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:25,880
everything out and then get it back into

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:28,520
the new thing and what have you and it

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:32,120
can be a huge task so it's really

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,340
important to choose the right solution

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,460
at the beginning and so one of the

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,160
benefits of using free software and is

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:43,190
that you can really explore the complete

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,010
solution before you commit to it before

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:48,860
you put in all of your business data and

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:51,500
you can download all these solutions and

00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,230
you could spend two or three months just

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,450
getting to know them to make the right

00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:00,610
decision before you actually spend a

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,610
month entering all your business data

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,470
you don't change wardrobes every year

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,570
and once you setup an accounting system

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,400
you're not going to change it for maybe

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,070
four

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,710
five years maybe ten years some people

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:21,760
will keep using the same system for

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:25,590
twenty years so the second thing to

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,450
think about is that with the wardrobe

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,910
would you get a wardrobe that is smaller

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:33,130
than what you need or would it be better

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,920
to get a wardrobe that might be a bit

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:40,080
bigger than what you need that you can

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,080
use some of the space later

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:52,010
yeah so a wardrobe that will fit in the

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,240
room so with with wardrobes yes this can

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,760
be a problem you may want to

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,890
deliberately limit what goes into the

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,030
Wardrobe and throw some things away but

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:03,470
with them with accounting systems

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,059
another problem that people have is when

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,549
they're starting a business like they're

00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:10,790
a startup company they just pick

00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:12,920
whatever software is recommended by a

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,960
friend or an accountant or they buy

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,059
something that they find in a shop and

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,690
it may be smaller than what they need

00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:22,730
and after six months they find that it's

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,010
like a wardrobe that's too small and

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,380
things are overflowing they they cannot

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,900
close the drawers and they need to

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,520
change and then they have this crisis

00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,590
scenario that they have to spend three

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,100
months changing their accounting system

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:40,960
and so a second thing about free

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:44,480
software is that you can take the most

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,640
extensive system that has features that

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,710
you'll never use or that you never think

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,780
you're going to use and you can start

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,809
using that system and just ignore those

00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:57,320
features for six months for two years

00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:59,240
maybe for five years but you know that

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,549
they're there and that you can turn them

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,799
on if you do want to use them in future

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,309
and so this is that one of the second

00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:11,200
big benefits of using free software that

00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:15,110
proprietary accounting software and

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,770
thrives on making things optional on on

00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:21,049
having different plans and licenses and

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,610
strategies to make you move onto a

00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:26,330
different product when you need a new

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:29,270
feature with free software there are

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,460
none of these games the license is free

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:36,740
and otherwise it wouldn't be in Debian

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:39,530
and if you're installing software for

00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:44,150
other businesses then this is also

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:46,610
important and because your clients will

00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,650
choose a free software solution that you

00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,860
recommend and they'll keep using that

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:54,140
solution for many years and their

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,300
business will be more successful because

00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,110
of the flexibility of that solution and

00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:02,450
and they will come to respect

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,540
free software because it's at such a

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,610
vital place in their business that every

00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,590
business depends on their accounting

00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,540
system they they have to pay their

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,049
salaries and pay their bills and pay

00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,730
their rent and they're using Debian

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:18,290
based solutions to do that so they're

00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,390
going to have a lot of respect for

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,270
Debian and free software after they've

00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,670
been doing that for a few years so

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:28,490
that's good for anyone who is in the

00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:31,340
business of promoting free software and

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:37,990
giving a high quality service to their

00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:42,110
clients so moving on to postbox

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:46,970
this is a very basic client-server

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:50,000
architecture and the postbox uses the

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:54,410
PostgreSQL database as the server there

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,210
is no post books server unless you want

00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,429
to run the web interface and then you

00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,490
need to run their web server process and

00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:05,570
if you only use their GUI client on the

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:08,270
desktop then Postgres itself is the the

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:11,270
server here we've got three people

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:15,110
running the GUI client and we've also

00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:16,640
got the the web server and web user over

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,010
on the right-hand side of the diagram

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,760
but you could cut those out and just

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:25,580
have one person running the client and

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,440
running the PostgreSQL database on the

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,240
same computer in fact the way that we're

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,799
going to do the demo today is running

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,580
the whole thing from the laptop the

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:37,990
Postgres is in my laptop and the GUI

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,990
client is in my laptop

00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:51,360
so to install post books on Debian you

00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:58,230
can open synaptic which is the GUI for

00:23:51,360 --> 00:24:00,299
installing packages you can search for

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:08,309
post books

00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:09,000
that's the GUI client and these are the

00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:10,890
schemas

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,720
so this is the demo schema that we're

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,730
going to look at you don't need to

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,330
install all the schemas but you will

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:22,919
need at least one of them and you also

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:26,900
need to install the PostgreSQL package

00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,900
we've got PostgreSQL

00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:37,619
I think there are a lot of PostgreSQL

00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:37,619
packages you also need

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:51,950
this PostgreSQL contrib package this is

00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:54,920
all in the readme debian so that you

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:58,490
will get all these things and you

00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:02,960
install those with the package manager

00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:05,950
and then you can run it so if we

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,200
minimize that so when you start it and

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,300
before you can log in you need to load

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,140
the database which you can do from the

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,970
command line

00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,090
the command for that is in the readme

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,400
debian and then you can login for the

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:25,100
first time we're logging into the demo

00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:29,930
database here which already has a whole

00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:33,350
bunch of transactions in it when you're

00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:35,450
doing an evaluation the demo database is

00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,460
great because you can just put things in

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,010
and mess around with them you can even

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,260
delete it and load it again but when

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,650
you're putting in real business data and

00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:48,980
and you want to use it you know for real

00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:51,110
please don't put your data into the demo

00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,060
database because then your data will be

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:57,020
mixed up with the demo data and there's

00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:58,970
no way to separate them I just popped up

00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:03,400
on the wrong screen so I move it over

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,400
here so this is the main window

00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:13,090
so if we look at Accounts Payable

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:22,070
this is how we put in a bill

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,399
miscellaneous voucher is the word they

00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:29,840
use for it in in post books in other

00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:32,720
software they might say a bill but here

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,139
they call it a voucher so we choose a

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:40,389
vendor so they gave us the bill we put

00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:40,389
in a date so let's say it was today

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:03,460
and then we put in the bill number or

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:08,649
the invoice number from the bill so I've

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:10,450
put in a number from a bill we put in

00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:13,690
the amount of the bill so it's a it's a

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:16,600
hundred US dollars there this is this

00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:21,750
demo also supports euros and British

00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:25,269
pounds and and we can tell it what the

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,950
the bill was for so we can choose at one

00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,679
of the accounts from the chart of

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:32,100
accounts and we'll say that bill was

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,100
four

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:55,000
about professional services okay save so

00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:57,640
that's down there now we could put

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,559
multiple services on the same bill we

00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:04,090
can keep going back and adding them here

00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:10,450
and let's try and save that and it gives

00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:12,700
us a warning a virtue for this vendor

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:18,100
has already been entered with the same

00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:19,780
vendor invoice number so it's saying

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,390
that this number has already been

00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:25,210
entered before and so that means I've

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,309
already entered that bill when you've

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:31,420
actually got a lot of bills this is not

00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:33,429
an uncommon mistake to make and this is

00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:36,309
just one of the small things that that

00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:38,770
you avoid when using an accounting

00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:42,580
software to manage all of your bills and

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:48,490
payments and has anyone ever paid a bill

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:51,070
twice yes yeah this is not an uncommon

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:53,530
mistake when you've actually got

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,590
multiple people in an organization who

00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:59,500
are collaborating to manage the the

00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:01,300
accounts and then the probability of

00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,429
these mistakes increases but the

00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,030
software tries to stop that with those

00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:08,320
little warnings but we can put the bill

00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,000
anyway with a different number just

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,830
because we're doing a demo and we don't

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,920
really care that there isn't really a

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:25,120
bill from this company and we post it to

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:31,800
the general ledger and that's done so

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,800
now we can go and see the general ledger

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,860
transactions

00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:41,030
the window has popped up in the wrong

00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:45,970
place again but here it is so if we look

00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:45,970
at all the transactions for August

00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:57,889
and there's our debit and credit in the

00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:01,039
general ledger the important thing to

00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:04,399
note here is that by using the

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:07,969
accounting software we didn't have to

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:12,049
remember then I which amount was a debit

00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:14,359
in which amount was a credit and the

00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:17,239
software takes care of all those little

00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:19,070
details for you and so this makes it a

00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:27,709
lot easier for people doing this for the

00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:31,389
first time finally and we can see some

00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:37,669
reports we go to financial statements

00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:40,839
view financial report once again we have

00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,839
to move the window

00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:50,720
and I'm gonna ask for the basic balance

00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:56,190
sheet for August

00:30:50,720 --> 00:31:00,570
you know query that so there we go

00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:04,920
we have an Accounts Payable liability of

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:07,020
$100 and on our balance sheet so

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,060
everything happens quite quickly after

00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,690
we put in all our bills if we put more

00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,420
bills

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,900
then that line on the balance sheet

00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:18,560
would change immediately if we receive

00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:23,490
some income then that will also appear

00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:26,220
as an asset on the balance sheet at the

00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:29,130
moment the assets of zero so we're not

00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,290
in a very good position and now this is

00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:33,780
a demo database so they actually have a

00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:37,400
lot of data in there already from

00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:42,180
previous years so if I go backwards to

00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:45,030
about 2012 for example I can see quite

00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:47,370
an elaborate balance sheet with a whole

00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:49,530
lot of things on it and if you're

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,450
learning accounting or if you just want

00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,760
to learn about the capabilities of this

00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,500
software and because you've used other

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,050
software and you want to make a

00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,780
comparison then you can use all this

00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:06,480
data to play with and to see what it can

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:08,970
do if you wanted to print this you can

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:14,270
click preview and you can see a nice

00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:18,270
report that you can print so if you're

00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:20,610
running a nonprofit organization or a

00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:23,160
community organization for example and

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,900
you have a board meeting and and you

00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,750
want to bring some financial information

00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:30,240
to the meeting and then this can be a

00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:33,600
very quick way of extracting that

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,170
information and having more transparency

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,000
in your organization and to get these

00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:42,690
reports you know someone has to be

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,910
putting the data in you know from day to

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:47,010
day or maybe once a month and then if

00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:49,380
all the data is in the system then

00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:52,050
whenever people ask for you know what's

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,420
our position are we solvent are we

00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:57,179
profitable and you can just click and

00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:59,269
give them the answer with a nice report

00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:59,269
and

00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,560
so the other thing I was going to bring

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:14,430
up today is Triton so we're only going

00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:22,390
to spend a couple of minutes on Triton

00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:30,070
the Triton also has a GUI we can also

00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:36,630
install it as a package to install

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:44,500
Triton you just look for Triton client

00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:48,070
the Triton server and the Triton modules

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:50,650
all and if you install those three

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:54,040
packages then everything will be on your

00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:56,740
system the readme dot debian file

00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,710
includes some steps for setting up the

00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:03,670
database and so that will take maybe

00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:06,400
five to ten minutes and then when you've

00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:09,000
done that you can login to Triton for

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,000
the first time

00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:33,650
so

00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:37,220
can people read that up at the back okay

00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:39,170
and at the front it's it okay I'll go

00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,090
through it quickly and I'll explain what

00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:47,060
I'm doing the the font is a little bit

00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:51,140
small in most of these things so if we

00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,820
go into this financial tree we can do

00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:58,220
various things like putting in an

00:34:52,820 --> 00:35:00,740
invoice so here instead of vouchers

00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,390
they've got supplier invoices so these

00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:11,480
are the bills you receive from your

00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:13,700
suppliers so we can go through the same

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:19,550
process that we followed in post books

00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:22,210
we can put in the amount the date the

00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,210
currency

00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,950
you can put the invoice number from the

00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,950
supplier

00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:54,240
now I've already created some journal

00:35:52,350 --> 00:36:04,020
entries in the system so I'm just gonna

00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:08,340
bring those up yeah so there we go so

00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:12,000
that's already been posted and so that's

00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,980
a transaction for 10 Swiss francs I set

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,130
this one up using the Swiss franc is the

00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,130
currency

00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:29,900
and finally we can go down to reporting

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:32,869
just like we did in post books we can

00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:38,180
report on the general ledger so we can

00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:42,470
see that the ten Swiss francs there in

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:46,130
the revenue account and we can see the

00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:50,000
balance sheet so once again it this time

00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:54,559
in this demonstration we've got an asset

00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:02,599
rather than a liability and so this is a

00:36:54,559 --> 00:37:05,000
more positive balance sheet this setup

00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:08,029
is far less complete this is not a demo

00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,950
database this is an empty database so

00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:12,650
there are a lot of basic things missing

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:15,109
from this demo I haven't even put in the

00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:17,420
names of any customers for this demo

00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:21,589
that's one reason I didn't fill out the

00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:23,299
the supplier invoice in the demo but

00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:25,819
nonetheless you can see that it has all

00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:30,940
the same concepts that we looked at in

00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:37,549
post books post books is developed in

00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:43,069
C++ in the Qt and yeah we're sorry the

00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:49,670
GUI and the web interface for post books

00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:51,740
is based on node whereas in the Triton

00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,990
system most of the development is in

00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:59,119
Python and there's a very different

00:37:53,990 --> 00:38:01,039
style of programming yeah there are

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,410
different use cases there are some

00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,720
people have specialized post books for

00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:07,460
manufacturing

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,980
whereas with Triton for example is a

00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:13,279
very well-known product you know health

00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:15,770
which is for healthcare so depending on

00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:18,470
the industry you're working in and the

00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:20,299
programming language you prefer and all

00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:22,160
kinds of other factors you've got to

00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:24,440
look at each of these very carefully

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,849
to work out which one is going to be

00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,849
more relevant for you and

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,270
so what next yeah play with the demo

00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:48,049
databases asking the mailing lists and

00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:49,970
forums and things find a chart of

00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:53,599
accounts that's usually the first step

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:55,579
in setting up an accounting system they

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,740
differ a little bit from one country to

00:38:55,579 --> 00:39:00,349
the next and sometimes they'll be

00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,599
specialized for your industry and and

00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:04,849
then you can just get started the

00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,980
software is there the licenses are there

00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:12,290
for you to download it copy it and

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:15,710
modify it as you need to if we use one

00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:20,720
of these solutions and it's easier to

00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:23,059
share responsibilities the forms they

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,710
hide all the debits and credits for you

00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:28,670
so that people can just enter things

00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:30,799
straight from a bill and you can get the

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:35,000
reports in just a few seconds like we

00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:38,089
did today you know when you're talking

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,510
about money and you know one thing that

00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:43,520
people often say is that either you

00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:47,299
control your money or your money

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:50,230
controls you and the same can be said

00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:53,839
with software with free software and

00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:57,859
like debian with a free license you're

00:39:53,839 --> 00:40:00,740
in control of the computer and you know

00:39:57,859 --> 00:40:03,260
with with proprietary software the

00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:06,170
software and the vendor controls you so

00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:09,170
when you put free software together with

00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,910
managing your money then isn't it likely

00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,069
that you're going to have more control

00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:15,950
in the long run then if you went down

00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:17,480
any other path and so I'd encourage you

00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:20,180
to you know to have a look at these

00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:23,240
solutions ask any questions

00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:25,819
use the Debian mailing lists or feel

00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:28,420
free to approach me today and so thank

00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:28,420
you for coming

00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:43,240
do do we have time for questions so okay

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:51,390
so just wait for the microphone before

00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:54,940
asking questions so yeah hello thanks

00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:57,339
maybe a stand up so you mentioned that

00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,619
different software suits well different

00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:02,769
industry so do you have an advice for

00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:05,230
the IT industry like IT services which

00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:07,690
software would sound better for an

00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:12,549
individual or for an IT service company

00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:16,000
with many staff IT service startup okay

00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:18,430
and I think that the best thing to do in

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,970
that case is to look at your skills so

00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:24,849
if you have people who do Python for

00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:27,519
example then you might start looking at

00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:30,190
Triton first because you know you'll be

00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,769
able to maintain it in-house if you have

00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:35,799
people who know C++ you might start

00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:38,200
looking at post books and if you don't

00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:40,299
have any developers in the company then

00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,759
you might look around your community and

00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:45,730
to see what other people are using in

00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:47,950
your city or if you're involved in

00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:49,839
groups within Debian for example then

00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,609
you might speak to other people you know

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,289
there and see what they're using it's

00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:55,539
good to have a support network around

00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:57,400
you so that you're not on your own with

00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:59,890
these solutions so these are all

00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:04,240
different things you could take into

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:06,549
consideration so so we have a second

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,400
question so it's a question it's a

00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:12,309
comment on free software usage in

00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,140
accounting in Germany the custom of mine

00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:18,160
was running on new cash actually and

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:21,099
then the tax office did an audit on them

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,750
and then well first of all what was

00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:24,730
missing was a certain export feature for

00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:27,069
the German tech system that was not so

00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,809
problematic but they said actually that

00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:31,299
the software for accounting in Germany

00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:33,910
has to be revision safe so that includes

00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:36,819
actually a closed source format because

00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:38,440
you are not supposed to reverse engineer

00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:41,960
actually what's in the accounting

00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:44,240
database and that actually blocked

00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,600
from my point of view free software

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,340
completely out locked it out and what

00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,830
the German tax people said actually is

00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,930
no you need to use commercial products

00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:56,360
so that the data format is is

00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:58,370
undisclosed so it's not known how to

00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:02,500
actually play with that and and

00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:06,680
manipulate the data in the accounting

00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:11,270
this is interesting because it's often

00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:14,540
found that this is not really achieving

00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:16,340
the outcome they're talking about you

00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,430
hear the same argument with many things

00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:21,500
people always find ways around these

00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,050
artificial restrictions it's the same

00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,710
with obfuscation instead of encryption

00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:29,300
people think that if you write something

00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:32,270
like in another language people won't

00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:34,130
understand it well maybe for half a day

00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,540
but then they'll figure out a way around

00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,870
it but is there anyone who knows the

00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:46,970
German solution and can talk about it

00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:50,960
more no we just go on to the next person

00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:53,720
though I can't talk about Texas stuff

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:58,040
and so but I know from the general

00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:00,230
practitioners solution where you should

00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,060
also not change your medical records I

00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:06,350
got of your patients right and the

00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:08,960
solution was to be in a hash zoom of the

00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:11,420
dekat and send them to some notification

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,400
server so you have not no access to it

00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,040
anymore or can't change it afterwards

00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,230
and this should be a solution also also

00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,360
in this case because the thing is not

00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:22,370
that format is closed but that you are

00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,790
not able to change it and this would

00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:27,320
solve the problem yeah I mean in finance

00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,630
they're talking about doing the same

00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:32,630
thing with block chains so that when

00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:36,530
banks make transactions between each

00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:39,620
other and like currency trades and they

00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:42,470
would use the the blockchain as a public

00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:45,800
blockchain to record those transactions

00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:48,200
so everyone has a copy and it's open and

00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,960
it can't be modified so they all know

00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,580
that the records are accurate so you

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,710
could actually argue that to ensure

00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,759
accuracy you need to have something

00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,839
that's open

00:44:55,759 --> 00:45:02,719
as opposed to closed so so this we could

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:05,089
have an extended debate about this but I

00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,979
think that's worth you know looking at

00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:09,619
more closely and I believe there are

00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:11,869
people using free software in Germany

00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:16,099
for accounting so that's worth looking

00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:18,039
at so and so the next hi thank you so

00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:20,839
much for your presentation today I

00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:24,069
invited a couple of people that are

00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:27,919
interested in this but probably the rain

00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:30,559
took them home so I had a question for

00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:33,079
you in terms of advocacy what do you

00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:36,109
think would be needed to break the cycle

00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:38,149
where people get advice some software

00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:40,969
and then the accountants are only

00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:43,429
trained on commercial proprietary

00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:46,880
software and then they advise people to

00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:49,219
use it and it stays into that vicious

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,729
cycle what do you think would be needed

00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:55,159
to break that because if I if I see the

00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:57,709
interface that the general presentation

00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:59,630
just by the looks and feel of the

00:45:57,709 --> 00:46:00,799
software feels like it's ready and I

00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:02,479
know some of these projects have been

00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:05,839
around for years and are used by

00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:07,789
thousands of people elsewhere but what

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,069
what what do you think would be needed

00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:13,130
to break that cycle okay so there are a

00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:16,759
few answers to that one is to look at

00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:18,679
students who are studying accounting and

00:46:16,759 --> 00:46:21,409
to say look we have a solution with

00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:23,630
Debian that you can do your course work

00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:26,119
you can become an expert in accounting

00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:28,519
you can run a complete accounting system

00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:32,479
on your laptop and get to know it inside

00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,949
out before you even graduate so for

00:46:32,479 --> 00:46:36,499
students that's a great opportunity

00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:38,689
before they start working in a company

00:46:36,499 --> 00:46:41,689
and they might not have a lot of

00:46:38,689 --> 00:46:45,409
experience and so if a lot of students

00:46:41,689 --> 00:46:47,269
get into free software early on then

00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:49,339
they will remember that throughout their

00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:52,759
careers even when they come across other

00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:54,979
solutions and this can be achieved by

00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:57,859
working with groups on campuses and

00:46:54,979 --> 00:47:01,839
helping them with their events inviting

00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:04,249
them to events like this and another

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:06,859
opportunity is to work with startup

00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:09,930
companies as I mentioned during the talk

00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:11,520
you know people often choose something

00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:14,040
then they don't change it until they

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,230
have a really good reason and so if

00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,210
they're starting their business and you

00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:20,010
get them started with a free software

00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,170
solution and they start using it and

00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:24,450
they write scripts and things to

00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:28,619
integrate with it especially if they are

00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:30,559
an IT startup or an app developer then

00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:33,480
they're going to be locked into that and

00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,450
whatever their accountant says is going

00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,880
to write you know right down here

00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:40,559
compared to the effort of changing all

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,780
their scripts and reports which is a

00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,640
huge effort they're not going to change

00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,440
unless they really need to they're going

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:51,420
to change accountants before they

00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:56,160
consider changing their software so any

00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:58,260
other questions or okay so maybe we have

00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:04,710
we have time for one this could be the

00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:07,530
last one okay just about the German

00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:10,770
thing the maintainer of right and he's a

00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:13,170
German and he has a small business where

00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:15,869
you offers this service so I don't know

00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:19,309
his solution but I'm definitely sure

00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:28,880
it's possible to use Triton in Germany

00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:31,980
okay I don't think so he was lost yeah

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:37,210
okay so thank you very much Daniel and

00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:45,300
everyone to come so thank you

00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:45,300
