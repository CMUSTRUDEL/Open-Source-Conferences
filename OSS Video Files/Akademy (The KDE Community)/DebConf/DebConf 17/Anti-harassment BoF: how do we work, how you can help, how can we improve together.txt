contributing to is the anti harassment

00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:44,490
team since about one year ago I couldn't

00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,970
come to that conf but it was very

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:51,180
interested in this path to happen so I'm

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,180
very thankful to Ana and to all the

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,960
people that made it possible and to all

00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,229
of you that are attending and I hope

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:08,280
participating I'm living in the Gobi

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:11,820
document a link to this test script for

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:17,790
the case it's shown to small in the

00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:21,720
screen and a link to the slides too

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,810
in this presentation I will explain a

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,290
bit what is the anti harassment team or

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,989
at least my understanding of it I'll try

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,380
to summarize the last year working in

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:37,260
the team and some challenges that we

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,170
face inside the team and in Debian in

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:44,880
general in order to improve the current

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:48,150
status of things so what is the Debian

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:53,430
anti harassment team you can visit our

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:58,950
wiki page to learn about it I will open

00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:02,670
now here we are a point of contact for

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:06,330
not only people seen or being victims of

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:10,170
abuse but but also for any community

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:13,320
member concerned of creating a more

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:18,239
welcoming and respectful environment in

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:23,130
Debian the main documents that we use

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:26,790
for reference and we recommend everybody

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:33,030
to know about them are the Debian

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:35,430
diversity statement approved in 2012

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:42,240
the Debian code of conduct

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:46,650
approved in 2014 and the BAP conf code

00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:53,210
of conduct introduced in 2014 if I am

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:57,180
not mistaken in May 2016

00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:59,340
some people noticed that the

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,420
anti-harassment team could be

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:06,720
unresponsive because some of the members

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:10,230
were retired of Debian or in here tools

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,050
for reasons and there was a call about

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:17,220
this and the team was relaunch it with

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:19,950
some new people me among them so you can

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:26,660
see the current composition of the team

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:29,910
in the webpage in our website about

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:38,910
organization in Debian and it's also

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:41,640
written in our wiki page here and this

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,120
is the current composition of the team

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:50,130
pati langa sec margarita Monterrey Ola

00:04:45,120 --> 00:05:00,590
louder Sun Arena which is me and nail

00:04:50,130 --> 00:05:05,490
McGovern what do we do or how do we act

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:09,450
usually we received we received a report

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:12,870
of bad behavior of somebody or a

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:16,610
violation of the code of conduct we

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:20,040
acknowledge the received we offer

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:24,120
listening and a friendly word from the

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:28,080
community by mail or IRC to the victim

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:31,800
or to the reporter we got an information

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,290
about the issue and if there is possible

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:39,510
mediation we talk to the offender and

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:42,360
offer it or we contact the offender and

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,790
explain the behavior that is wrong how

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,260
can they improve the situation

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:52,410
proposal and offer help or support in

00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,990
making things better we try to

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:59,340
understand and respect everybody's

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:02,190
feelings we focus on the bad behavior

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:06,720
and the type of the community

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:12,030
Debian wants to be and then we iterate

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:14,670
and finally close or escalate we try to

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:22,020
keep the reporter informed about the

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:24,750
process and about our tools apart from

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,180
the reference documents that are you

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,690
already mentioned we don't have much

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,060
other resources to help ourselves handle

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,620
the different issues that come to our

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:40,170
inboxes we have reviewed the wiki page

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:44,600
which included some links to further

00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:50,000
info and resources and we have added

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:55,520
some more at the top of the further in

00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:01,860
info section here these are the new

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:05,610
links if you know any other documents

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:09,330
that can help the team members or any

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:12,440
Debian contributor to promote a more

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:16,500
welcoming environment or to deal with

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:19,080
conflicts or misbehavior please send it

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,490
to the Malolos and we'll consider adding

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:27,720
it to the wiki page but note that if we

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:32,220
end up with a long list of links the

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:35,940
wiki page may become less useful so help

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:39,720
in creating that section selecting the

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:45,150
most adequate and updated links is also

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:49,710
welcome finally the own activity of the

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:52,080
team helps ourselves to learn from

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:56,250
experience for the good and for the bad

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,889
and when a new issue arises in some

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,520
cases we can

00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,229
we use some parts of former

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,949
communications in order to act quicker

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:10,550
and in every case we can also try better

00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:13,719
and done the last time note that for the

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:17,360
good or for the bad we or at least me

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:24,409
don't keep history of the activity of

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:27,409
the team before May 2016 so now I'll try

00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:31,990
to produce a kind of activity report of

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:36,019
our last year I've have counted about

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:42,949
forty threats or conversations since

00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:46,459
July 2016 until today a short summary of

00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:49,970
the topics we have dealt we have dealt

00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:54,620
with seven issues three of them are

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:57,529
still ongoing four issues about behavior

00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:02,149
in the back tracking system one issue

00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:06,350
about content in planetarium and two

00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:10,940
serious issues about behavior of Debian

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:14,449
contributors towards people only these

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:18,890
seven proper issues mean about one issue

00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:23,800
each two months average this is in my

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:27,800
experience a pace of almost non-stop

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:33,019
because some issues take months to get

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:36,709
them handle and closed and we have more

00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:40,250
requests in between as I explained now

00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:42,860
we had three more messages informing

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,660
about potential issues that didn't go

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,130
further

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:51,949
fortunately we had six six messages with

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:55,910
removal requests from the mailing list

00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:58,790
archives one of them was spamming as an

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,790
act of harassment and that was the only

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:05,120
one that could be tackled by us and the

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:08,660
messages removed as spam after some time

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,240
the orders were answered or redirected

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:15,920
to list masters but no

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:20,920
an action was taken we had to troll in

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:24,589
messages ignored but they motivate him

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:28,010
we had four requests from Debian project

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:32,089
leader Debian account managers or that

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:35,050
committee about issues or people to

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:38,060
ongoing because of the ongoing issues

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:42,050
some more non-spam email some of them

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:45,320
was answered some other got buried in

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:47,600
our inboxes for example a request of

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:52,070
interview about enforcing a code of

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,430
conduct how does it work in practice who

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,350
didn't answer

00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:01,930
finally some more internal communication

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:04,130
about five tasks that are still pending

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,459
updating the wiki page which is

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,040
partially done as I explained before

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:16,730
creating a GB GK it was proposed but

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:20,800
undone yet about a report to the DPL or

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:24,980
to the project we started on January

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:29,300
couldn't be delivered due to dark lack

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:31,870
of team feedback it's being partially

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,870
done today

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:38,750
a task about renewing then that conf

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:41,899
Code of Conduct it was proposed by

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:44,180
several Debian contributors I sent a

00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:48,440
second proposal after working on it

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:50,839
there was consensus in there is more

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,329
work needed together with the deccan

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,329
team and here we are

00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:02,060
and finally communication about

00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:04,779
enlarging the team or renewing some

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,970
members that are not active so

00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:12,279
everything gets done and we have some

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:16,850
rotation for our own mental health and

00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:21,480
that's all from the report or for my

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:25,410
parts now I propose some topics

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,660
for discussion here throw some ideas but

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,940
it's not mandatory to discuss about them

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,860
if there are other topics of more

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:38,750
interest of the audience one idea for

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:42,720
discuss is the name of the team

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:47,010
anti-harassment put some people in

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,300
defensive mode I'd like a name in the

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:53,220
positive side

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:55,470
make him feel people making people feel

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:59,280
that we care about the health of the

00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:04,170
community about respect about

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:07,020
inclusiveness we can do some

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:10,070
brainstorming in the copy a lot Miley

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,810
but proposals there too

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:16,260
another topic for discussion can be how

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:20,850
to strengthen the team and legit new

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:24,210
members rotation or so because issues

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:30,570
are hard and discussed in model of most

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:33,570
of the time are there any volunteers who

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,540
decides who is in the team last time was

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:41,850
the DPL some people volunteered and the

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:45,180
DPL accepted them probably after today

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:48,330
the team is more known and the number of

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:51,960
reported cases will rise we are a big

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:55,350
community and even 2% of people

00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:58,380
suffering harassment it's a lot of

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:01,710
people and a lot of issues for a small

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:07,260
team can we maybe tackle this at the

00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:13,650
team level some kind of moderator roles

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:16,650
in each team I don't know another topic

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:23,750
for discussion is that we are slow we

00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:28,590
try to breathe deeply mission or words

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:33,060
be kind coordinate an answer inside of

00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:35,490
the team we have few experience some of

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:41,250
us are not English not if you speak

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:44,730
so everything takes time some iterations

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:48,029
take a week or more if there is a peak

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:53,420
of other work or life stuff delays

00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:57,259
increase and people suffer it's sad

00:14:53,420 --> 00:15:01,199
another possible topic for discussion is

00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:04,589
delegation or not delegation currently

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,509
we are a consulting body some people

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:10,589
understand anti-harassment

00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:13,350
as motivators and D escalators some

00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:16,370
others feel that anti-harassment

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:20,189
will need more powers to enforce

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:26,040
themselves the code of conduct on the

00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:28,350
side in serious issues currently we

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,420
gather information try to mediate if

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,009
possible and produce a report or

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:39,180
proposal as I explained before not else

00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:41,699
nothing else how to report our activity

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,639
to the project the format of the reports

00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:49,819
I don't know if what I say makes sense

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:58,100
for you resonates or it's kind of vague

00:15:49,819 --> 00:16:00,839
like the level of detail where to report

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:06,300
Debian project mailing list is public

00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:10,139
for example so when once a year when

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:14,339
something happens after closing any

00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:17,639
issue I don't know and that's all I

00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:21,149
think from my part thanks for attending

00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:24,029
and I hope you can discuss and I will

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:31,589
try to follow closely they stream the

00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:34,920
copy and the IRC now it's your turn

00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:38,149
thank you very much and hugs and kisses

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,149
for everybody

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:48,100
so this was the debt report from louder

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,000
we have a few a few things now and go

00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,860
with that we are going to start

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,010
discussing now we also have Marga here

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,440
who is our chaperones a team so I will

00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,120
also I would like to ask you once to ask

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,390
something to watch it whatever she has

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,390
said

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:18,420
test test yes so I think Laura made a

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:20,189
great summary and I agree with the

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,860
points of discussion for me the main

00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:25,260
thing that I would like to discuss it's

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,420
the name which was the first item in her

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,400
list but it's the last and Govi whatever

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,510
I really think that being called

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,610
anti-harassment

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,110
is detrimental to the team because when

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,610
we write to someone saying we are the

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,680
anti-harassment - you like the person

00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,930
easily oh I'm being accused of being a

00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,750
harasser and like it doesn't lead to

00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:45,120
good results so it would be really nice

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,100
to have a more positive name that leads

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,160
to like we are trying to create an

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,290
inclusive community yeah and the other

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,840
issues are also interesting to discuss

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,880
but I'm interested in hearing what

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,980
people have to say okay so the main

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,980
thing is the gospel for a reason

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:08,010
well more than in Dayton for discussion

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,530
we reach the conclusion that is you know

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,260
like a fiend up that is more likely to

00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,679
have some depth by sharing you know

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,030
offensive purposes also so we decide to

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,679
to read that for the last attempt

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,630
because of worst case scenario something

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,920
that can be discussed later by making

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:29,309
movies or whatever so on the future a

00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,780
point as Laura has explained is the anti

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:34,890
harassment team right now is not a

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:37,320
delegated team I would like to hear your

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,990
source about it should be a delegating

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,400
or not and which powers the things you

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,350
have because right now something

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:48,260
important is rating has absolutely no

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:50,880
power they only have let's say the the

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,380
obligation of reeling the people who who

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,790
are million doing I'm trying to have

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,790
them but absolutely no power

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,679
so about the delegation I think it's

00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:12,320
it's quite important that it's a team

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,570
that gets at the delegation but I don't

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,179
see that it absolutely needs to have

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:20,299
specific powers so it's kind of yes but

00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,950
no so but I think it's it would be

00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:24,710
really nice to have a delegation because

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:28,730
it lays down it also brings credibility

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:32,149
to the team by being at the receiving

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:34,570
end of a delegation but I I don't really

00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:37,789
think it needs additional powers I mean

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:40,070
it when a problem arises you have you

00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:44,929
either make sure the person leaves or

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:47,139
you find for example on the lists the

00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:49,519
list masters will enforce it if they do

00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:52,389
so you don't need that power at the

00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,389
anti-harassment team

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:02,820
I was just gonna come to that I mean I I

00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:05,369
possibly do agree with you but the

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,229
counter to that is to say that there's

00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,539
no point having a team which does a lot

00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:12,239
of work comes up with a solution and

00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:14,820
then finds out after the fact

00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:16,679
potentially that another team in Debian

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:22,289
doesn't want to enforce what was the

00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:26,340
decided solution so that's the risk if

00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:29,549
the effect some point there's a there's

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,919
any look power let's talk about it as

00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:36,629
far as dam is concerned there is space

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:40,200
for discussion I won't go into detail

00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:43,769
now because worked out at the moment but

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,509
I recall there's been conversation but I

00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:46,950
am don't remember the details that the

00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:51,529
only thing I remember is that there is

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,529
space for working something else

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,950
what about powers to the king does

00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:07,600
somebody have an opinion what actually

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,600
should be the actual powers of the team

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,590
it's more a question tomorrow well what

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:20,530
are the powers that you would need to to

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:24,040
to promote the diversity we want and

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:26,560
protects the victims because I've kind

00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,180
of failed to answer that question myself

00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,000
maybe because I'm not in the position

00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:37,450
but yeah what are the powers you would

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,310
need when it comes to people who feel so

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,500
they're being harassed and feels that

00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,970
they're victims in these situations it's

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,580
very important for them to know that

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,460
there is immediate recourse and that

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:51,220
after that there can be like further

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,190
discussion periods because when you

00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:57,730
allow somebody who is positioned as a

00:21:54,190 --> 00:22:00,250
harasser to maintain a presence and like

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:04,150
active contribution to a project what

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:06,790
you're saying is that that person's like

00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,770
potential value is more important than

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,350
creating a safe space or comfort for the

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:15,460
people present and involving like the

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:17,590
community at large the other thing

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,820
that's big with that is it's really easy

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:23,140
for people to report incidences I've

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,510
heard the term like the phrase use

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,850
incident reporting a lot rather than

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:31,050
like harassment reporting because it

00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:34,450
like kind of softens the conversation

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:36,070
but when you're having like this

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,770
theoretical maybe something will happen

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:41,320
in the future you know it doesn't all

00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,700
the time and I bet a lot of us can think

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,190
of a case where we've seen something in

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,990
the news like perhaps with a like a cop

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,580
shooting someone where they say there's

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:53,380
an investigation and that's the end of

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:55,300
the story so right when we are

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,990
discussing the powers I think there's

00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:02,380
also a question of what our scope is

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,910
which is very unclear right so we are

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,530
the anti-harassment team so we are

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,550
supposed to receive complaints regarding

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:12,100
harassment it's not that those are non

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,770
but they are very few we have many more

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:19,060
complaints about violations of the code

00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:21,490
of conduct that don't don't fall under

00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,530
they have typical definition of

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,450
harassment

00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,420
right that we have a code of conduct and

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:31,020
sometimes people make mistakes and they

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:33,210
violate the code of conduct and so we

00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:37,050
get this thing so for example someone

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:40,110
was mean to someone else on a bar is

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:43,080
that really our scope or is it no it's

00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:46,020
not clear we get the reports we try to

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,450
mediate we try we do our best into like

00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,370
creating an inclusive community but it

00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,320
isn't really clear whether this is our

00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,990
scope or not so we are always in a

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,730
constant struggle of are we really

00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,940
supposed to be the people doing this

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,650
work or not because it's not that

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,930
someone is being sexually harassed where

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,540
you can really say okay this is the anti

00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:09,300
harassment team responsibility it's

00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,880
someone making awful comments on a bug

00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:15,600
if I'm talking too much just anybody

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:18,000
tell me to stop so a pretty common take

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,680
on groups that are doing like anti

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,440
harassment worker like definitions of

00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,780
harassment in communities is usually

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,040
around not just like you know the

00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,830
example of sexual harassment but

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,690
harassment in general and like that's

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:34,080
being taken in a broader and broader

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:36,180
definition these days so racist comments

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,040
in addition to sexist comments in

00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,170
addition to like things like being mean

00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,780
or making someone feel uncomfortable

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:45,180
because of a discriminatory practice

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,920
which usually looks like picking at

00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:51,660
someone based on skill level or

00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:54,030
demographic like identity so when that

00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:56,070
happens and like with incident reporting

00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,780
teams kind of the assumption is the

00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:01,140
first thing they're gonna do is just

00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,730
talk to the person and say hey like this

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,250
is this thing that happened this is how

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,930
you made someone feel uncomfortable you

00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,310
know and there's a lot of nuance like

00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,540
you're never supposed to say who the

00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:12,690
person was who said they were feeling

00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,990
uncomfortable like there's negotiation

00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,990
in that

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:25,790
on the question of powers I mean I guess

00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,050
as a practical example do you think that

00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,840
do you think that this team should be

00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,820
able to decide for example that if you

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,350
got given some examples of someone whose

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,360
behavior on the list seems to be

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,190
completely inappropriate do you think

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,840
this team should have the power to say

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,090
that person is banned or should it be

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,370
merely that you say we're going to send

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:46,290
this as a dossier to the list masters I

00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:51,300
mean what's your opinion is of the

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:54,720
purpose I'm not sure why we are focusing

00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:57,480
so much in my opinion because the point

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,910
of to listen to your opinion as a

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:05,790
community rather than our opinion as a

00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:12,330
team so I'd rather listen to the answer

00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:15,480
from other people and not for me yeah

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:17,100
well the importance I think of hearing

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,080
your opinion is that having dealt with

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,870
these cases for example a louder percent

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,090
that that in one case you were able to

00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,460
remove a message and in other cases you

00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:28,890
were not because list masters didn't

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,370
agree and I think that as a data point

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:34,350
is important you yet the scope of this

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,990
team is not defined because it implies

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:39,030
everything because it could imply I

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:43,110
don't know if somebody today want us to

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:45,300
to upload a hot baby back into the

00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:48,030
archive well at the harassment would

00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:51,090
probably step in at the harassment or

00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,340
whatever this is a RiRi named too so

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:57,810
yeah the scope is way too broad

00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:00,060
but because the problem is a transversal

00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:03,390
to all of the interaction areas we have

00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:06,420
even as technical as they can be or as

00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,730
social as a committee I want to make a

00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,140
comment before you continue until her

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,930
husband team they are only four people

00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,240
they cannot check everything so when you

00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,570
say that something like how the baby

00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,880
will happen they will step in

00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:22,470
always see that even if your respect

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,470
to read emails in communication

00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,790
Delphine's of course hot babe would rush

00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,640
somebody in the math way

00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:34,860
who would feel attacked and would a file

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,900
a crack of danger that user never never

00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,190
please expect the anti harassment is

00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,290
going to be reading everything on the

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:45,510
ovens water please always contact a

00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:48,390
Harrison to to take action so one I

00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:53,370
think one interesting idea is that the

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:56,370
list masters delegation could could be

00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:58,710
reduced to like them being only the

00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:01,050
technical thing and delegating every

00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,990
anti Harrison question to the anti

00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:06,600
Houston team if it was sufficiently

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:11,580
staff etc blah blah blah but but saying

00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,840
any exclusion from a list should go

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,400
through anti-harassment and whatever

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,230
decision would be binding and the list

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,080
master are just the technical executives

00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,790
and don't take these decisions ever the

00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,170
prom now is that auntie Harrison does

00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:53,370
part of the job and then to your own

00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:55,470
opinion without having so if auntie our

00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,080
husband decides that somebody shouldn't

00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,950
be a debian member it's actually that

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,860
I've been account man is a

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:05,690
responsibility to make that call glad to

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:09,570
listen but if I remove a person because

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:13,200
auntie our husband told me so but I feel

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:17,250
like I shouldn't then I am the personal

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:21,800
responsible for membership so probably

00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:26,670
it's my call and not auntie are spent

00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:28,320
but this then brings up the question of

00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,960
what is the responsibility of anti

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,550
harassment if the responsibility is

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,779
making it so that that bean is a safe

00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:39,029
space that is it you

00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:43,649
two responsibilities and it should come

00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:52,159
with huge powers revered spider-man

00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:56,219
problem so if the responsibility is a

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:59,429
mediation or or making sure that no

00:29:56,219 --> 00:30:02,759
complaints will be unheard

00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:05,399
there was a good point of safety is a

00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,899
shared responsibility it's not just anti

00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,179
harassment that keeps their being safe

00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:12,589
it's the whole of Debian and anti

00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:15,570
harassment ease to make sure that no

00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:18,089
complain will be unhurt if it hasn't

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:21,929
been taken care locally in which case

00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:24,210
there's possibility shared and there

00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,200
could be the final collectors of things

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,289
that would have fallen through the

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,679
cracks to be forwarded to the others if

00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:34,139
the least masters are not acting on anti

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,879
harassment because they don't have time

00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:40,529
that is a red flag

00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:42,269
so I've see it on on a broader

00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:44,359
discussion of what our scopes and

00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:47,909
responsibilities and how to make them

00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:50,509
reasonable and actionable both in terms

00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:55,830
of expectations and in terms of powers

00:30:50,509 --> 00:31:01,200
okay Dean Chandan Jimmy and so I think

00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:05,129
that there is one problem of having this

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:08,429
decentralize the decision-making because

00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:11,190
well then it could be very difficult to

00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:14,519
enforce any kind of action and you might

00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:16,859
have to justify it everything like first

00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,839
to justify 20 harassment or whoever team

00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:20,159
then that makes a recommendation then

00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:23,909
you have to justify it again to another

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:29,879
team I think that can be problematic for

00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:31,559
the people effective their victims will

00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:35,879
having discussions and I think I agree

00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:38,339
with the idea that I the I think anti

00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:40,830
harassment and done that they should

00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:44,269
have somehow worked together or maybe

00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:46,310
have anti-cosmo have some more

00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:49,830
protection or

00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:52,860
support role but I definitely think that

00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:56,370
some team needs a delegation with tools

00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,530
to enforce sanctions when they are

00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:01,980
needed and to act in the protection of

00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:04,800
our members and I think was a project we

00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,440
have failed for too long to protect our

00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:11,670
members properly and I think we need to

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,700
do something about that so I wanted to

00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:17,670
say one thing but as my own opinion I

00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:21,030
also wanted to mention that further up

00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:22,620
on the garba document Laura gave her

00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:25,200
opinion and those of us who were

00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:27,620
focusing on the in-person conversation

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,930
may not have noticed I didn't at first

00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:33,540
she she I think liked the idea of

00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:36,450
balance balancing the powers across the

00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,920
different teams and and said that

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,550
there's always a dam in the DPL if

00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,930
necessary but if you want to read what

00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,950
she said I'm not going to speak for her

00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:47,430
when I can't read her on the screen

00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:53,970
right now my my point was going to be

00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:57,420
that the the impact of a communication

00:32:53,970 --> 00:33:01,200
from a team with a set of enforcement

00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:03,180
powers versus a team without a set of

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,290
enforcement powers feels different to

00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,600
the person on the other side of the

00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:08,130
conversation and I am not actually

00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,070
advocating one answer or the other

00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:13,560
answer I'm just at least not at this

00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:15,300
point I'm just saying that so similarly

00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:19,350
if you're talking to a manager or an HR

00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:20,490
department at a job Human Resources it's

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,110
a very different conversation than if

00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,910
you're talking to a peer or support

00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,190
group in a safe space so we should

00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:30,420
consider what type of reaction we're

00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:33,390
looking to get and what type of powers

00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:36,560
would make that better or harder as one

00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,560
of the factors we consider

00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:49,410
yeah I think I mean I put this idea and

00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:53,560
the gobby but I'd like to hear your

00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:56,500
reactions to this a maybe a way to get

00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:01,450
out of this well where's the limit of

00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:05,980
the power of whom a could be to change

00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:09,220
the composition or change yeah to make

00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:13,450
the anti-harassment team be of one

00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:16,419
person out of each key team I mean if

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:19,630
one of them and one of least Masters at

00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:22,330
one of their committee they become the

00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:26,050
 harassment team may be aided by by

00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:29,290
others I don't know just think this case

00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:31,419
this could solve the the issue of what

00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:35,310
power do you have to to take this

00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:35,310
decision that belongs to another sphere

00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:43,030
okay thank you everybody for your

00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:45,640
opinion let's talk a bit about the

00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:47,169
second the second point in the path how

00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,179
to repair activity to the project

00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,860
because auntie her husband have been

00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:53,440
doing they have been to energy over

00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:57,160
silently for for a couple of years at

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,050
least now so far and louder husband now

00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,780
they feel reporting the having done so

00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,950
far and when things are not reported

00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,630
people think that either they are

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:08,560
working a lot of the earth we know him

00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:11,290
so which level of I wish letter or of

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,600
report in deducing do you think they

00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:17,430
should go reporting a lot reporting

00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,430
periodically report on us of course

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:28,710
I think in my opinion not much reporting

00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:32,250
will be needed because there's not much

00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:33,839
you can share but probably making sure

00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,109
that everybody else that anti-harassment

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:43,500
is there and that can be reached

00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:47,009
nothing will be very useful agree with

00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,630
you but I guess I would say having some

00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:50,640
reporting is useful just to show it

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,980
exists but that could be like once a

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,720
year to say we've dealt with some

00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,000
incidents and just opposed to summary as

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,549
the kind of summary that's given here

00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:09,420
I don't think monthly or weekly reports

00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:13,710
would be helped at all if a nobody else

00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:16,019
has if it's to make visible that

00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:19,950
anti-harassment team exists then bits

00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:23,390
from the anti-harassment team with some

00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:26,339
report and some suggestions on things

00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:30,690
did you know if you are uncomfortable in

00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:33,079
Debian you are not alone it sounds like

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,079
a joke

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,710
okay we have like 10 minutes left so we

00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:43,300
are going to be putting everybody wants

00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:44,890
to go to a signing of the team so how do

00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:52,060
you think that thing should be named

00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:54,430
please give you CDI 80s future

00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,810
well theme first you will need to define

00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,700
the scope to be able to find a name

00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:03,910
certain office worth having the

00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:06,850
discussion so I agree with that and this

00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:09,070
is just the Tor project is going through

00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:12,400
this a little bit and they have a team

00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:15,520
called Community Council and I think

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,710
their scope is much wider they do deal

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,110
with harassment but other issues and

00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,060
it's a team that is composed of five

00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:24,190
people and the project votes on who's on

00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:27,610
the team but I think that's a good name

00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:29,230
for a wide scope but I agree that the

00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:31,650
name is kind of connected to the scope

00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,650
question

00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:47,469
okay so let's go back to the point three

00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:52,719
okay yeah what one thought is that in

00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:56,439
the earlier the the goals discussed in

00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:59,949
the earlier diversity roundtable lineup

00:37:56,439 --> 00:38:03,279
a little bit with one of the points

00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:05,859
louder I made for this team namely

00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:08,709
fostering a welcoming inclusive culture

00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:11,739
within Debian separate from handling

00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:14,439
specific incidents and if that is this

00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:17,829
if the scope does cover both points as

00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:19,569
opposed to just handling harassment then

00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:21,189
maybe a broader name like diversity and

00:38:19,569 --> 00:38:24,119
inclusion could be appropriate but that

00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:27,099
seems I don't think any I don't think I

00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,719
don't think anybody was envisioning the

00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:31,079
two things as the same team so that's a

00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,079
different question

00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,480
so loud I mentioned this during her

00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:44,470
presentation about the about the team

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,420
she was suggesting that the Korean pace

00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,490
of the thing is a lot of work to handle

00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:52,240
phone for the people who are currently

00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:55,329
active on question that she put his

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,690
house right at the team so far last year

00:38:55,329 --> 00:39:00,970
when the thing was listed under body was

00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:06,240
active I call for hello bozo and allowed

00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:09,430
I step in but she she have is wondering

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,109
how to how to get more volunteers and

00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,839
how to make sure that the volunteers are

00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:15,430
people who should be able to to handle

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,380
with this because nobody really knows

00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:20,290
how to handle with this and I personally

00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,210
going to us another question do you

00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,710
think that the anti harassment in

00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,359
whatever name they will have she'll have

00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,490
somebody who is totally external to the

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,540
community but trying to handle this kind

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,540
of thing for helping them

00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:41,819
can you clarify what you mean by that

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,729
because if they're working on this they

00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:46,199
kind of become part of the community so

00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:46,949
I'm do you mean someone who

00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,989
intentionally

00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:51,389
to try and choose someone who doesn't

00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:52,739
know about Debbie I mean there is this

00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:55,619
idea that have been floating around

00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:57,389
admitted to to this scheme that there

00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,159
are plenty of in the Debian contributed

00:39:57,389 --> 00:40:01,679
don't like doing for example accounting

00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:03,749
so this idea of paying for you know

00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,479
keeping keeping that round keeping the

00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:07,469
money all day of the project I think a

00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:09,799
lot of people wants to do

00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:12,839
anti-harassment or related teams because

00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:14,519
no another anti-harassment related teen

00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,859
who are also doing this kind of job is

00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:18,719
known as wrong one

00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:21,119
so I was wondering if which will get

00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,880
paid and get somebody who is paid to do

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,839
this for helping specializing in

00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,839
handling these kind of issues

00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:34,769
no Billy okay I think it might be hard

00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:36,809
to get is harder to get people to

00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:38,279
respect the decisions if it's someone

00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:42,679
who's from outside the project I would

00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:42,679
have guessed but it's hard to say for me

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:51,530
okay so there's somebody wants to do a

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:54,830
proposition about if people from outside

00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:56,810
ISM is of interest I do have one idea

00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:59,330
that might be helpful to the team would

00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:02,510
the team have an interest in someone who

00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:04,850
is dealt with with harassment issues in

00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:07,220
some sort of specific area common do

00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:09,260
like a guest chat or something with the

00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:11,210
team to talk about their you know their

00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,560
expertise to help the team learn from

00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:19,160
that is that something that you would

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:21,020
want for me i was mentionin idea you you

00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,670
think you have something that could have

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:26,240
you should contact them i cannot really

00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:28,400
avoid it is proposing okay I'll talk

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,780
contacting my wife works at a domestic

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,980
violence shelter so she's dealt

00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,750
specifically with harassment issues

00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,020
around that and I'm sure someone at her

00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:37,580
agency would be willing to do a one-time

00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:43,040
discussion just to give expertise and

00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:45,290
share it with the team like I was about

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,860
to say something similarly money

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:53,390
invested could be paying for training if

00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:54,770
like mediation facilitation that could

00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:57,940
be good for our dear husband and not

00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,940
just for NTR's Minh

00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:15,100
yeah so yeah so anybody here feels like

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,590
proposing and the poor words at the

00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,970
tissue have given that we are ready

00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:22,420
let's say that everything should be

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:27,490
doing a lot maybe we can close the

00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:29,760
devolution proposition it's a difficult

00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,760
question

00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:49,250
yeah there's a few names community and

00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:52,690
programming anti-harassment yes the

00:42:49,250 --> 00:43:03,110
thing is the anti-harassment perm is

00:42:52,690 --> 00:43:05,570
nice okay so we are going to leave it

00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:07,490
here if it happened to somebody this

00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:11,480
evening get away so maybe about a name

00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:14,290
for the thing you sending an email and

00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,290
