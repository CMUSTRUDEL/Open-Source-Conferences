	00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:11,070
this is John Sullivan I will do this

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,950
when I'm supposed to be John Sullivan

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:21,060
some of this is this is so not gonna

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:31,410
work this is gonna be great no oh wait

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:31,890
no there's a right-click okay it's gonna

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,329
be great

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,040
we'll figure this out that'll happen a

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,790
whole bunch more times it'll be

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,380
wonderful I'm not John Sullivan he can't

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,480
make it here because it turns out my

00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,450
legs are much more reliable than his

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,980
plane however he did tell me to break a

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,990
leg but thankfully that didn't happen

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,080
till right before this otherwise we'd be

00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,760
in a whole lot of trouble I'm Molly de

00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,329
Blanc I work at the Free Software

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,050
Foundation oh and by the way if I talk

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,250
too fast and just yell Molly talk slower

00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,690
because I have a tendency to talk fast

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,049
when I get excited and I get really

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,369
excited about free software so I'm the

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,140
campaign's manager at the free software

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,840
foundation I've been there since June

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,039
5th this is my first talk as a

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,960
representative of the free software

00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:17,219
foundation so I hope it goes well and

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,100
that they don't fire me because I'm

00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:26,340
still in my probationary period however

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:28,259
John Sullivan has been the director for

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,759
six years the executive director and

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,009
he's been with the FSF actually since

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,319
2003 he's been around a long time and we

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:40,950
like him a lot who here was born after

00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:45,479
1985 I don't anyone me right we are the

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:48,420
good new generation thank you for

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,459
laughing at that one it was Paul tags

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,499
joke actually so give him props where

00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,179
props are do you know we've actually

00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:56,850
never lived in a world without free

00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:59,159
software free software really did come

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,079
about before 1985 but that's when the

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,060
free software foundation or the FSF was

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,340
founded things were a little bit more

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,020
formalized at that point and we can

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,310
really recognize that for some of us in

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,929
this room at least we've never known a

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,720
world where free software didn't exist

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,510
and that's something really cool all

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,790
right at the FSF and the new project we

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,170
have this goal we want all

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,659
computer users to be able to do

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,430
everything they need using only free

00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,659
software right so this isn't we're not

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,640
saying that it's great if you can run

00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:28,469
free software our dream our goal our

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,420
fantasy for the future is that at some

00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,959
point everything you're doing will be

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,670
done using free software so John's

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,409
titled this talk freedom embedded it is

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,989
not about embedded systems it's about

00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,819
the idea that when we we have all these

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,049
devices and they're not necessarily

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,970
running free software they're running

00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:47,159
all sorts of different things so we want

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,819
to think about what it means for

00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:53,519
software to be free on our computers

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,799
when we get on on our devices it's

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,540
untitled devices that respect to users

00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:59,879
in their communities because we really

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,769
want to emphasize in this talk the idea

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,299
that we're talking about user freedom

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,310
we're not necessarily talking about the

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,930
technology itself we're talking about

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,639
the people who use the technology we're

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,560
talking about you your friends your

00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,060
neighbors your family the people who are

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,359
impacted by these tools that they're

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,849
using so I'm gonna really quickly go

00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,980
over the four freedoms I am delighted

00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:21,569
that many of you already know what these

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,180
are and that this is a little

00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,290
superfluous but it's nice to go over

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,190
them anyway

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:32,159
there are two misconceptions that bother

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,659
John about free software and the four

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,540
freedoms so just to cover them really

00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:38,209
quickly is that when there's a license

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,790
that meets the free software definition

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:47,940
chances are I'll just keep my hand on

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,510
this other button that I broke it it'll

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,879
figure it out

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,500
chances are it also meets the open

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,060
source definition right and the open

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,470
source definition as you may know is

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,060
based on the Debian free software

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,190
guidelines which were an attempt to

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,569
describe what it looks like for a piece

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:05,939
of software to be free so things that

00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,139
are free probably are also open and

00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:14,519
things that are open are probably also

00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:18,889
free yes are they how do I I'll just

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,889
take them off but they they look so cool

00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:26,900
no it's I don't want to be imbalanced

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,349
style is very important guys cool the

00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:37,469
other thing about free software is

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:39,389
sometimes people will come up to me or

00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:41,370
other people involved in

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:43,949
standard-setting organizations and say

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,289
so I want to make a license that's free

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,150
but and the bots always nervous right

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,680
and that's when they say but I don't

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,150
want the government to be able to use it

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,430
or I don't want anyone to be able to

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,159
make money on it and when someone does

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,409
that what's actually happening is that

00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,300
license isn't free right for something

00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:05,699
to be free it needs to be able to be

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:17,879
used this is number two maybe that's

00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:21,300
okay well we'll work on ah that worked

00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,190
for some reason that time um great so

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,440
right so the freedom to run the program

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,789
for any purpose and this includes like

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,020
you know you're taking a risk when

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,520
you're making something for your saying

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,889
that the government might use it that

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,150
someone you don't like might use it and

00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,190
also that it might be used for

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,479
commercial purposes regardless of

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,909
whether you're making any money off of

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,409
that next one and is the freedom to

00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:43,639
study the proud the program works and

00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:45,659
change its to do whatever you wish

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,460
usually when I talk to people who aren't

00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,870
already involved in free software I talk

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,289
about two things that I like a lot which

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,089
are cooking and knitting so for example

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:56,639
you know I have a lot of friends who are

00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:58,169
vegan so let's say I'm cooking something

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,949
but I want to make sure my vegan friends

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,409
can still eat it

00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:03,270
alright so I replace butter with oil i

00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:05,610
replace eggs with apple sauce and flax

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,979
seeds so I'm making these modifications

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,800
to the recipe and I'm allowed to do that

00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,210
alright they start with zero so freedom

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,860
number two is the freedom to distribute

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,379
copies to help your neighbor so I can

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,400
share my recipe with whomever I want and

00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,529
not only that I can share my

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,330
modifications so it's not just that I'm

00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,889
making these changes for my own benefit

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,560
I'm making these changes and then like

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:30,509
everybody else benefit from those all

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,580
right okay so next thing new topic let

00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:38,539
me find the

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:40,069
for that okay that's the one I want so a

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,360
lot of people don't actually know when

00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,069
they're using free software a lot of

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,289
stuff is free and a lot of machines

00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,090
devices and actually just like the world

00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,110
we interact with that large has freedom

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,090
inside of it

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,500
and we might not know that Android is a

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,150
good example of this right Android is

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,800
one of the largest free software

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,050
projects in the world in terms of users

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,110
there are over a billion people using it

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,599
that's incredible

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:05,060
however see that's that but again the

00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,129
however in this case is that chances are

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,069
if you're using Android you're also

00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:12,469
using the Google Play Store which is

00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:13,759
proprietary when we're using something

00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:15,289
that's free we have to be aware

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,669
especially when it comes to our devices

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,740
and integral ways that they're working

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:23,419
together is that what we think is free

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:25,340
might not necessarily be so one of our

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:27,289
like examples that we keep coming back

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,150
to about this as we talk about DRM

00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:32,090
because DRM is easy to talk about and a

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:36,159
lot of people can connect to it one

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,940
example of this was in 2009 Amazon

00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:41,930
famously if you care about these things

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,360
and follow them remove copies of 1984

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,819
from Kindle e-readers ones that people

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,529
had purchased people interviewed who had

00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:50,270
had their copies removed a lot of them

00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:52,310
were students and not only did they lose

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,400
the books they lost the notes they had

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,020
taken about the text this was for

00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,990
copyright reasons and it was enabled by

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,779
the fact that there is DRM so it turns

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,210
out that even though you own something

00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:08,180
you might not own it or at least there

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,279
might not be technological tools in

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,839
place to keep somebody from taking it

00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,759
from you

00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,560
in the Amazon case what happened after

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,050
that if they said okay guys we promise

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,849
we will never do this again

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,469
swear to God no you know but they didn't

00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:23,029
make any changes in terms of how they

00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:24,680
interact with your Kindle and how you

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:26,719
interact with your ebooks from the tech

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,419
perspective what this means is that

00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:31,490
actually last year they then went on and

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:32,899
took all the books from other people and

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,579
this has happened on several occasions

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:38,959
that they just happen to make a bunch of

00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:40,880
things disappear emo Philips I don't

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,600
know who that is if any of you know cool

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,440
you can tell me later he made a joke one

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,210
day a woman came up to

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,190
and said didn't I see on television I

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,100
said I don't know you can't see out the

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,380
other way so it actually turns out that

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,370
you kind of can't see out the other way

00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:01,220
Vizio is a company that among other

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,890
things make makes software on

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,570
televisions I assume most of you have

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,730
computers in your pockets I mean I

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,540
actually took mine out of my pocket this

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:15,080
is my pocket computer it turns out that

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,220
I also have a computer there and I'm

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,040
sure there are a bunch of other ones in

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,290
this room you know our television that's

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,030
a computer so the software that's being

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,160
run on it when it's not free when it is

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,180
still proprietary software you know

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,000
we're looking at these things we don't

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,220
control so invisi o--'s case what this

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,380
actually turned out to mean was that

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,710
they had created software that read the

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:39,440
pixels on the computer ie the television

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:42,290
in your kitchen in your home and

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,940
reported back what was on it like what

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,430
you were watching so there's a lot of

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,930
power in demography in the demographic

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,880
studies of who's watching things on

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,170
television what kinds of other things

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,350
that they're watching how this plays

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,660
into marketing it's really well studied

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,510
so like you know it's it's kind of

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,130
useful arguably for a company to know ok

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,690
well the people who are watching Game of

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,890
Thrones are also watching x-files reruns

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,080
but it turns out that they weren't just

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,760
doing that they were in fact matching

00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,320
those two IP addresses so lesson just

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,530
like oh there's this person who does

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,120
this thing it was Oh Molly watches Game

00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,410
of Thrones and X Files reruns and well

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,450
I'm pretty open about both of those

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,580
things that doesn't necessarily mean I

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,700
want a company to know that and that

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,770
that company has the right they have the

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,780
right not me to sell that information to

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,910
whomever they want or give it away to

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,440
whomever they want this could be used in

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,150
in terms of like what this looks like

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,800
practically is it can be used for things

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,410
like governments learning about your

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,360
political affiliations it could be used

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,890
by your health insurance company that

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,150
wants to know what sorts of things

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,770
you're doing are you watching a lot of

00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,150
television maybe we should raise your

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,390
rates because you're probably not that

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:53,360
healthy not to make that correlation

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,730
that was when John made so how does this

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,890
happen right key pieces of software are

00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,260
proprietary you know we get these cool

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,420
things looking back on

00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,640
or your phone if you're running android

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,220
is you have this like really neat thing

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:10,540
but also a very integral part of how it

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,340
works is proprietary now amazon has on

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,200
their Kindles a lot of them are based on

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,420
Android or any Linux in different ways

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,280
but still DRM technologies than other

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,240
restrictive technologies that come on

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,350
them are proprietary devices are locked

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,970
down and don't provide builder

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,340
installation info so sometimes you do

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,540
have access to the code in something but

00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,550
that doesn't mean you can actually do

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,890
anything with your phone I love my phone

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,900
it's one plus it's great they're not

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,670
paying me to say that but I also can't

00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,670
take the battery out of it which is

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,530
really annoying and I'm using that as

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,910
kind of like a different example of the

00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,230
same thing which is you could have

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,210
something and you can in theory have

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,490
access to it because I can pry the back

00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,900
off of it but taking the battery out

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,020
like doing anything with it is really

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:57,220
hard network connectivity has no

00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:59,460
granular user control remember when is

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,750
this on the next slide yes great perfect

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:05,860
actually now I'm gonna go back sorry so

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,350
one of the things that's happening now I

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:11,730
believe it's one of the newer versions

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,710
of Windows is you're forced to accept

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,300
security and other updates whenever they

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,520
want to have it push to your computer

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,530
right what this means in practice is

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,780
this company now has access to your

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:26,590
computer in ways that you can't tell

00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:28,540
them know so not only do you not know

00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,920
what they're doing do you not know what

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,390
they're putting on your devices they

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,110
don't know you don't know when they're

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:37,720
doing it here's this example of some

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:41,230
DDoS attacks because devices weren't

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,760
under the control of users you know and

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,470
because they also had some proprietary

00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,540
software and those pieces of proprietary

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,540
software we're all actual dangers that

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,120
allowed that allowed criminals to get

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,120
access to your machines and do things to

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,340
change them there are many many more

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,990
examples of both technologies and

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,670
horrible things that have happened you

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,840
can check those out at canoe org slash

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,220
proprietary so what can we do how do we

00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,380
deal with this that we're living in this

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,930
scary dangerous world well one thing we

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,230
can do is teach basic computer literacy

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:15,240
looking back at cooking I hope

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,950
or assume many of you know how to read a

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,570
recipe I know how to read a recipe that

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,010
doesn't necessarily mean you know how to

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,200
cook or know how to cook anything in

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,610
particular what it means is you have an

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,800
idea of how different parts fit together

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,150
when we talk about computer literacy

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,220
we're not talking about teaching

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,310
everyone to code instead what we're

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,840
hoping is that people will be able to

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,580
think about how that your computers work

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,260
to understand how their computers work

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,350
and to see how the parts of them fit

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,700
together

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,190
all right persuading people to care

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,210
thankfully luckily many of you care

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,540
that's why you're here I really

00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,980
appreciate that I care that can be

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,720
really hard making people care about

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,070
something but when we can do it it's

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,110
great and it gets them more involved and

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,090
it gets them thinking more right we can

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,390
enable people to act on things this this

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:03,000
is clear labeling clear labeling can

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,920
mean things like just making it explicit

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,270
whether something is coming in an OK way

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,530
or something is coming in a way that

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,520
restricts your freedoms right out the

00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,650
door

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,450
so DRM labeling books says having DRM is

00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,210
one example of this alternatively

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:19,460
labeling things as being DRM free or

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:23,100
leed-certified or humane provides that

00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,720
security as well we can meet demand I

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,890
don't know about the rest of you there

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,300
are lots of things that I really want to

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,920
do with free software that I can't do

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,360
this doesn't mean I use proprietary

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,830
equivalents this just means I don't do

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,000
them that I'm frustrated and I sit at

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,730
home and I cry and I don't have an

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,870
e-reader anymore because mine broke so I

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:42,480
read less it's kind of sad so by

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,430
creating tools that will allow people to

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,380
meet those demands we're doing a great

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,400
job we can also grow the movement it's

00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,910
accomplished by a lot of these other

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,130
things getting more people involved so

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,460
one of the things that we do when we

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,800
talk about labeling is we look at

00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,480
licenses right so how do we know if

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,120
something is under the GPL this is some

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,380
information about the GPL if you would

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,880
like to know more about it I am NOT

00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,340
going to read it I think it is useful to

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,320
read slides for people who have vision

00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,320
impairment there's a lot of text here

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,270
you can read it yourself it's great it's

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,560
a great read somebody told me that once

00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,860
and I read it and found out that that

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,590
was true so how do we know something as

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,300
the has the GPL well it can be hard to

00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,610
tell which software comes inside of

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,940
something and what the license is on

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,760
that

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,680
where are because devices and computers

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,200
can be very complex machines that have

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,460
lots of different moving parts right so

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,840
you might know that your phone runs

00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,330
Android but that doesn't mean you know

00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,070
what else it runs or like what Android

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:45,720
is connected to and what those libraries

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:47,670
are even what a library is it can also

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,670
be dangerous to download free software

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:54,630
right there are attempts and work at

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,880
enforcement surrounding free software

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,050
things with people labeling things as

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,490
for your people labeling things as

00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:04,020
open-source but there is not there

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,230
aren't the kinds of regulations that

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:09,690
come around other sorts of things that

00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:13,800
people are being labeled that things

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,060
with things that are being labeled also

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,560
when you're downloading a piece of free

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,750
software similarly actually when you're

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,730
downloading any piece of software is

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,190
you're trusting that the person who made

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,480
it is is worth your trust that you're

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,800
trusting that they're going to respect

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,710
you and that they're not going to do

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,060
something off onto your computer as many

00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,920
of us are probably aware that is not

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,690
always the case and lots of horrible

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,930
things show up on your computer all the

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,520
time and it's hard to find all the

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,780
license notices in something I don't

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,640
know if you've had this experience but

00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,810
I'll be told oh you know we're gonna

00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,820
have this meeting using this

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,910
teleconferencing tool I'll be like great

00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:50,400
well what what license does it use is it

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,660
free and they won't know so I'll look at

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,370
the company and then they'll see

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,080
something somewhere and then I like have

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,580
to find their github page but it doesn't

00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,110
have a license file so I have to file a

00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,790
bug request me up they had a license

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,340
file or sometimes if I feel really

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,829
snarky I just like you know commit and

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,290
say hey this should have the GPL they

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:09,540
don't usually go for that I recommend it

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:13,230
though on ADD license files if you don't

00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,780
have them on your things but also like

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,540
and then you're like okay well this part

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,430
of it has a free software license but I

00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,410
also need this other thing to make it

00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,510
work and there's nothing about their

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,709
client that they're using on the like do

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,910
I need to use can I use the desktop

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,350
client oh the web client so then you

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,610
write them an email and then you're

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,380
talking to someone from tech support who

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,170
doesn't know what a licenses and you go

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,429
oh god I'm now that jerk

00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,870
so those things happen right so there

00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,960
are Hardware labeling this is one way

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,350
that hardware labels can look labeling

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,630
comes in

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,880
shapes and forms there I think it's

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,350
damnit that's the car manufacturer and

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,870
when you get a car you get this nice

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,490
thick book of all the licenses that are

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,910
being used to make it run I think that's

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,530
so cool and some of these things are

00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,970
like kind of unhelpful like you know you

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,010
look at the piece of chocolate and says

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,270
may contain nuts milk eggs or soy

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,270
because it's processed in a facility

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,860
that has peanuts this is kind of the

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,940
same thing this is from a Linksys router

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:11,460
oh it's not very helpful upon request I

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,750
also I love this source codes so open

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,480
source software source code is available

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,419
at cost from Linksys for at least three

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,130
years from the product purchase speaked

00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:22,169
that's really cool so this is one way

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,640
that we think these sort of things

00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,830
should work instead you know we don't

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,750
think it should come saying hey here's

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,400
some stuff that might be involved with

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,890
your technology we think it should say

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,539
hey just so you know when you first get

00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,010
this thing it's really dangerous you

00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,750
don't know what's gonna happen with it

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,179
you have to trust some people who you

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,880
don't know to see if it works and good

00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:44,010
luck here's one example of friendlier

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,809
labeling so it's not only are we not

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,100
looking at a lot of text on something

00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,740
we're looking at something that's cute

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,960
and easily recognizable this is from the

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,570
this is the leaping bunny program from

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,490
Coalition for consumer information

00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,350
information on cosmetics what this means

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,190
is that your stuff was not tested on

00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,390
animals and that it is animal friendly

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:06,450
we were inspired by this so this is what

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:11,280
we came up with oh wow I'm going through

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:12,929
this very quickly great we came up with

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,620
this idea for the respect your freedom

00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:19,650
certification what we wanted to do with

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,510
respect your freedoms was come up with

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,340
something similar to the leaping bunny

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:26,400
something people could look at devices

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,289
and say hey like this is free software

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,240
and not only is this free software this

00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,240
is running on completely free software

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,620
kind of as a side note there is this

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:40,080
thing called H node 8 you know our YF is

00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,700
we call respect to freedoms RAF RAF is

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,860
different than hardware compatibility

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,360
database that is not what it is

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,159
each node however does provide a

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,559
hardware compatibility database and

00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,360
commentary on what sorts of thing like

00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,919
what what different devices have

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,820
different technologies what you can do

00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,669
with them what you

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,320
do with them so that's a different

00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:02,309
program it's totally worth looking into

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,039
it's hto org and it's great Oh dad since

00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:06,720
I left great um so what are the our YF

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,940
cry team cool

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,609
nothing genes what are the RAF criteria

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,559
um the first thing is that you know it's

00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:15,109
running a hundred percent free software

00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,330
so everything that you're obviously

00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:20,159
interacting with is free we have an

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,009
exception for secondary embedded

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,509
processors like this right sorry

00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:26,639
there's an exception for secondary

00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:28,529
embedded processors like firmware on a

00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:30,119
hard drive we want users to be able to

00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:32,340
upgrade and control the software at as

00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,470
many levels as possible if and when the

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,450
freedom becomes available for use in a

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,519
secondary process or we accept cert we

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:42,389
expect certified products will adopt it

00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:44,849
within a reasonable period of time we

00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:48,059
expect that users will be able to

00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:49,470
install modified software so it's not

00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:52,139
just that we can download things from

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,119
the App Store but we'll be able to you

00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:56,399
know install something that our friend

00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,960
changed and then sent to us on however

00:20:56,399 --> 00:21:02,210
people are sending are people still

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:05,309
using floppy disks thank you

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:09,419
compilation that you'll be able to

00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:11,159
maintain software that they'll be

00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,720
installation guidelines that it's not

00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,659
like you're installing this thing and

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,629
they're like good good luck have your

00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:19,590
enjoy yourself in the future don't

00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:20,340
they'll be they'll be getting some work

00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,960
to help you with that

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:27,059
there'll be no spying or backdoors I

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:29,190
feel like I hope that's obvious so we

00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:31,169
actually say you can support encumbered

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:34,679
formats but you also have to be able to

00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:37,200
support unencumbered formats so you can

00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:39,119
have proprietary file formats and

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,909
proprietary file extensions as long as

00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,259
there are also free ones involved

00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:46,559
patents need to be licensed to all users

00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:49,080
I am NOT a patent expert we will have

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,489
someone here later today or tomorrow who

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,139
is then you can talk to Debbie Nicholson

00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:54,509
if you want more details about how

00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:56,580
patents interact with software and how

00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:58,409
patents interact with you as a user and

00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,729
what that means for you as a hacker

00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:02,009
somebody who wants to modify the

00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:04,700
software you're using documentation must

00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:06,869
be free free documentation refers to

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,260
documentation under some Creative

00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:09,570
Commons

00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,460
licences and similar things there's the

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,530
new documentation license it's things

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,970
that ensure the four freedoms but when

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,760
you're looking at text rather than

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:21,000
software we you can't have misleading

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,790
endorsements so you can't say oh you

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,100
know this is our way of certified but

00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,080
it's also made especially from Macs

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,630
unless you know Apple is also adding a

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,070
certification to that you also have to

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,500
cooperate with FSF and renew

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,640
communication we use a lot of specific

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,230
language at there free software

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,180
foundation because we think it's

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,850
important to make different kinds of

00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,680
linguistic distinctions one of the

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,450
clearest examples of this as we say good

00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,480
new Linux rather than Linux we say free

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:51,150
software we infrequently say free and

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,410
open-source software so we say free

00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,510
software there are a number of other

00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,310
terms we have a website if you want to

00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,140
read all about them so we request that

00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:01,410
people use terms like good new Linux

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,240
instead of just Linux this is our first

00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:05,850
certified product I'm gonna read this

00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,490
because John wrote it's great yes it's

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:12,540
called the lulzbot but it's no joke we

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:14,490
were very serious about certifying it so

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,640
the whole spot is a 3d printer made by a

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,200
left objects' it's pretty cool we have a

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,400
bunch of them in the office so if you

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,010
ever are in Boston you should come visit

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,780
the FSF and you can make something with

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,060
one of them or just look at the line of

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,370
like nine of them sitting there it's

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,430
very impressive for us it was kind of

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:34,950
convenient when they sent their device

00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,630
to be certified the first one you can't

00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,960
really see this but somewhere in that

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:43,080
there's an R Y F mark which had been

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:47,100
used in a photo for Make Magazine which

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,450
was great like immediate publicity this

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,560
is the thing that the founder of Alif

00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:55,380
object said it is long but I have some

00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,180
time so I'm going to read it to you Alif

00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,400
objects Inc is honored to have the first

00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,960
Hardware product with the FSF's respect

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,970
your freedom certification mark and

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,740
we're proud to sell a 3d printer that

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,990
delivers freedom to each and every user

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,460
Alif objects Inc was founded with the

00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,260
idea that people should be free to use

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,910
learn from and improve the machines they

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,320
use in and share their improvements and

00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,930
innovations with collaborative

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,310
communities ie the four freedoms the

00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,780
spirit and philosophy of the free

00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,100
software movement is embodied in our

00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,870
lolz about 3d printer

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,760
all of our printers ship with hardware

00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,650
designs software and documentation all

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,360
under free licenses you get it all

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,220
source code design documents and

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,110
specifications everything needed to

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,929
control tinker fix and improve upon

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:36,000
every aspect of the printer here are

00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:38,549
some more products we've certified think

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,370
penguin I believe they're a sponsor here

00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:46,049
unless John's notes are outdated they've

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,010
done some pretty cool things one of the

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:50,910
things that they've done is they've

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:52,200
taken a IBM ThinkPads and refurbished

00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,130
them so that when you get them out of

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,409
the box

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,480
they're running entirely free software

00:24:55,409 --> 00:25:00,120
something I don't think I really

00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,950
emphasized earlier and the way deserve

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,230
to be was that when you're getting

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:10,770
something that's RAF certified oh wow

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:12,270
it's ten minutes it's not okay CIL when

00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,740
you're still getting something our way

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,840
I've certified out-of-the-box what that

00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,990
really means is that every aspect of it

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,400
is running free software and not only is

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,049
the company making a promise to you

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,179
because companies make promises all the

00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,490
time that they don't keep see Amazon

00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:28,530
mentioned awhile ago but it means that

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,750
we at the FSF we with are very strict

00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:33,059
and high standards are also saying that

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,280
we believe we believe in this product

00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,299
and we think it's doing a good job

00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,400
here's some other stuff think penguin

00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:42,330
has a wireless broadband router see

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,919
that's a cool our YF label here are some

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,470
statistics of some specific things

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,630
techno ethical had created a bunch of

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,850
products not too long ago there 16 of

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:53,700
them the office was a disaster because

00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,960
we had stuff everywhere while we looked

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,309
at them everything that's certified is

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,900
certified piece by piece we take it

00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:00,510
apart we put it back together we look at

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,860
every part of how it works our licensing

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,820
team is amazing and you should thank

00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,490
them all for the work they do

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:09,150
I love objects 3d printers think penguin

00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:12,960
mini free Vikings and went Olympic

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:16,559
tweedy smaller software's the x2

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,179
hundreds modified so if you want to read

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:23,309
more about the certifications that's

00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:24,600
online it's at you fsf.org slash 28x you

00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:25,980
can also poke around our webpage for

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,720
that I know you're all gonna copy that

00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,809
down and look it up as soon as this talk

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,040
ends also purism

00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:33,300
you know they're here their sponsor you

00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,240
should talk to them

00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,310
if you have more questions about this

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,690
there they make laptops that respect

00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:42,360
your rights they are not our YF

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,710
certified but they are trying really

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,360
hard to do a good job they're very

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,650
dedicated to the Four Freedoms and we

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,930
respect that they did crowdfunding to

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:54,380
get a lot of their work started and they

00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,450
raised almost double their goal of

00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,950
$250,000 it's very impressive

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,730
novena is another company that bills

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:04,650
itself as like a goal like a company

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,780
that has this goal of supporting those

00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,190
sorts of ideals and involvement and

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,580
again if you look you notice that they

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:16,020
like one significantly above their

00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:18,630
crowdfunding goal and then there's libre

00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,170
boot as another example of something

00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,820
cool

00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:24,150
I'm gonna read another John note here

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:28,740
cuz it was great Wow I am so far ahead

00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:36,900
than his goats are thank you for your

00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:38,520
patience you guys are great oh yeah

00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,230
liebherr boot came into being in order

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,520
for the maintainer to be able to make

00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,980
and sell laptops that meet our criteria

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,540
it replaces a computer's proprietary

00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,930
boot firmware with free software but

00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:51,000
it's and this is really important to me

00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,560
people sometimes criticize the FSF for

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,450
pushing too hard for not compromising

00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,760
enough but people want us to promote

00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,020
laptops that are more free that some

00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,480
people want to promote laptops that are

00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,070
more free than most laptops but we have

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,740
examples like this where our standards

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:06,240
helped inspire what we wanted to see

00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,040
alright so the people working on Libre

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,600
boot wanted to meet this qualification

00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,750
they wanted to create something that we

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,190
thought would be great too um so what do

00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,770
we need we need to loot new laptops

00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:19,080
refurbished laptops are great reduce

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,190
reuse recycle but it would also be

00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,960
really cool if people could go and

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,450
purchase an entirely new laptop that's

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,810
fresh off the however they make them the

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:30,180
belt that is completely free you know

00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,710
that respects who they are tablets

00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,780
everyone's into tablets these days

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,060
mobile communicators cell phones or

00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,220
equivalents ear eaters please please

00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,290
please make me an e-reader I would

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,850
really like it it'd make me happy

00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,170
and then there are all kinds of new

00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,560
hardware that we're coming up with there

00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,309
are medical devices that's a big deal

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,570
we have wearables we

00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,009
virtual-reality we have these things

00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,559
coming out that are integrating into our

00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:53,820
lives in more and more intense ways one

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,350
of the things I say when I talk about

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,789
free software is that someday people are

00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:59,820
going to be up to 80 updating Twitter

00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:03,059
with their eyes and I actually don't

00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,289
think that that is far off and it would

00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,620
be pretty scary if that was being done

00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:12,330
proprietarily also a car you get a car

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,860
you get a car okay we're getting

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,570
self-driving cars and electric cars

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,700
right and it would be really great if we

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,679
could trust all those things but with

00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,769
cars especially you know there are these

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,179
structural barriers there are these

00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:26,490
institutional policies that have been

00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,629
created that keep people from being able

00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,529
to do these things all in their own

00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:33,029
right so they're they're like

00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:34,350
requirements of hardware Jarrell

00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:36,360
jails there have to be ways that people

00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,389
can't access technology according to the

00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,970
FCC and other government organizations

00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:45,179
there's a lack of free software GPU

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,869
firmware a lack of support for certain

00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:49,049
chipsets

00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:50,639
by free distro so like if you've had the

00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:52,110
experience of installing Debian and then

00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:53,789
suddenly your wireless card doesn't work

00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,149
and you have a really hard time figuring

00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:59,039
that out extrapolate from there Intel

00:29:57,149 --> 00:30:00,419
management engine and AMD is equivalent

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,580
there are a lot of problems with that

00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:04,080
we've been doing some writing allison

00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,879
Randall's nodding so you can talk to her

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,799
about it later or you can read our

00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:10,590
website

00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,029
here are some future plans of ours we're

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,289
discussing levels sometimes people ask

00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:14,820
us why there aren't levels why aren't

00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:19,230
you saying this is more free and this is

00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:22,379
less free and it's because we think it's

00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:24,090
important that when we say this is our

00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:26,220
why are why of certified it actually is

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,559
freedom respecting from the parts you

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,840
see to the parts you don't and all the

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,289
ways it works so we don't want to

00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,059
compromise that we have eleven pending

00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:38,220
applicant companies with products to

00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,690
review it's really exciting some people

00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,509
have sent a stuff some people haven't

00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,340
the office is really cluttered we're at

00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:48,330
the bottleneck it is our fault

00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,980
that's kind of cool and it would also be

00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,570
great if people funded development right

00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,990
so crowdfunding is kind of we're looking

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:58,019
back at this as the example development

00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:01,040
is expensive right one of the things

00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:02,990
that came out of peers um's work is they

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,490
they did a survey of people who'd

00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,200
purchase their product and a lot of them

00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,790
actually said that our YF certification

00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,430
was meaningful to them

00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:12,230
so participating with projects and by

00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:15,800
telling them these things it does impact

00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,030
the decisions they're making there have

00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,100
been a number of successful crowdfunding

00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:21,320
campaigns that we have written about and

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,180
other people have written about so you

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,490
should look at more into that if you are

00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,290
interested in it we think it'd be great

00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,170
and we hope to help directly fund more

00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:31,730
free software development and reverse

00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,380
engineering the FSF is working on

00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,270
putting together a reverse engineering

00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,460
award so if that's the thing you're

00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,950
interested in you can check out our

00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,960
website or talk to me or email us to get

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,040
some more information on that and then

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,590
those are the sorts of things that are

00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,110
really necessary for us to understand

00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:55,910
how these weird closed technologies work

00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:58,100
so we can build better ones there here's

00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,300
a statement from RMS that I'm also going

00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,430
to read I might read a little quickly

00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,900
for free designs to give us Hardware

00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:05,000
freedom we need future fabrication

00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,710
technology we can envision a future in

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,150
which our personal fabricators can make

00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,530
chips and our robots can assemble and

00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:12,050
solder them together with transformers

00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,760
which is keys displays fans and so on in

00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,440
that future we will all be able to make

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,150
our own computers and fabricators and

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,890
robots and we will be able to take

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,810
advantage of modified designs made by

00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,220
those who know Hardware the argument for

00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:25,150
rejecting non-free software will then

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,950
apply to non free hardware designs too

00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,970
that's a bit why we think standards for

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,960
hardware freedom are important and

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,970
actually just hardware freedom it's

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,170
important in general some conclusions we

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,760
think things are possible we think

00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,650
there's a bright beautiful future coming

00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,810
ahead of us and then if we work hard and

00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:41,960
work together we can make it happen

00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:43,040
labels help people care right it reminds

00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,390
them that this is something that they

00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,950
should care about it makes them aware of

00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,750
this thing and it puts it in their face

00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,480
and then it helps them make good choices

00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,070
and it helps them raise awareness now so

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,200
if when you go to the store seeing that

00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,240
humane like humanely certified raise

00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,430
like stamp on your eggs like that

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,020
actually matters these are things we

00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,190
need now more than ever the world is a

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,340
scary place and it's only getting

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,470
scarier in terms of surveillance in

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,320
terms of privacy in terms of DDoS

00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,210
attacks in terms of everything that

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,220
involves with how that's involved with

00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,409
how deeply technology

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:19,340
computers are penetrating our lives in

00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:22,280
every way and how insecure and scary

00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,330
they are but market demand is not enough

00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,299
because proprietary software is

00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:29,990
subsidized right so you may or may not

00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:31,580
have thought of this but you know there

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,960
is the in the u.s. there's the Digital

00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,090
Millennium Copyright Act that is

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,190
something that US taxpayers are funding

00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:39,289
to exist our funding to be perpetuated

00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,210
you know in the u.s. we are paying for

00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:42,770
courts to deal with those cases the

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,169
government is helping these sorts of

00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,730
technologies persist right in the EU

00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:50,510
you're seeing the link tax

00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:53,929
I think that's article 5 or 9 or I think

00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:55,039
it's a prime number you can read more

00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:56,929
about that later but that's another

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,210
thing where there's like a lot of time

00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:01,610
and energy and money from people in the

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,080
EU being gone into like further

00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,720
restricting the ways people use

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,840
technology in the internet that kind of

00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,669
sucks and is taking advantage of us so

00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,990
you should support us in the work we do

00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:14,090
there are a lot of ways you can do it

00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:16,340
because RAF is great and you all care

00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,230
about our YF now and you want to see the

00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,909
best completely freedom respecting

00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,830
devices everywhere and you're going to

00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,570
next laptop you're gonna buy is gonna

00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:26,899
come out the door with Libre boon it's

00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:28,760
gonna be great so one of the things you

00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,570
can do is buy those rof devices all

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,490
right

00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,440
you can join the FSF you can always join

00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,810
the FSF it's great I hope many of you

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,790
are FSF members because it allows me to

00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:42,129
do things like come here and eight I

00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:44,929
like both of those things we were funded

00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:46,550
80% of our funding comes from support

00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:48,589
and donations by members that's huge

00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,629
it's something we're very proud of that

00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:52,220
we like really get to work for our

00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:54,980
members because we're supported by them

00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:57,560
and we're not like the hold until it

00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,720
companies we need volunteers to help

00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,980
review our wyeth applications if you

00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,359
care about these things and have any

00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,119
knowledge of them or you want to learn

00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:07,849
more please contact us you can email us

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,349
at info at fsf.org we'll triage those

00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:10,580
emails to the licensing team and the

00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:12,770
people who are working on this stuff

00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,420
there are only 13 of us on staff total

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:16,520
so the RAF team is actually just two

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,770
people one of whom is doing the majority

00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,810
of the work we really need volunteers to

00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,980
help out with that you can also talk to

00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,109
Alison Randall about what it would be

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,330
like to volunteer on RAF certification

00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:27,070
you can subscribe to our free software

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,390
supporter which is a

00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:31,900
available in French it is also available

00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:34,210
in Spanish I can't read either but I

00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,740
trust our translation team you can ask

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,940
your employer to support us and you can

00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,400
learn reverse engineering because

00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:47,530
reverse engineering is really cool ok

00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:49,200
that's what I've got thank you I really

00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,310
appreciate you all bearing with me uh

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,690
because this was John's talk and I'm

00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,610
glad that you showed up anyway I know

00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:57,670
I'm not as cool as John Sullivan but I

00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:00,810
have better hair so is there time for

00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,810
questions ok

00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:12,449
okay I can finally walk across the stage

00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:14,789
God can you elaborate on ask your

00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:18,929
employer to support us how that would

00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:21,630
work is there some yes so things that

00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:23,579
are currently going on is we do have

00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,529
sponsorships there are different ways

00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,269
sponsorships look one of them is one of

00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:29,059
our the big things we do each year is we

00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:31,499
have a Libra planet conference in March

00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:33,209
we don't have dates yet we're planning

00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:35,399
it we just started but all of you should

00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:37,890
come you should all submit talks for the

00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:39,779
call for proposals and it's super fun

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,699
and super awesome and they're totally

00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:45,449
stylish t-shirts almost as cool as the

00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,919
dev comp ones so like we do take

00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:48,899
sponsorships for Deb comp but actually

00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:51,539
the FSF also takes sponsorships flat out

00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:53,159
that's where a significant amount of

00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:57,630
that 20% that doesn't come from

00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:59,309
supporters and donors comes from some of

00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,859
it also comes from grants but the

00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:03,269
majority of it does come from like

00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:04,289
organizational support we do take

00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:09,749
donations

00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:11,549
in terms of like technology and or we

00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:13,889
take time if your company wants to

00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:16,409
volunteer someone's time to us we

00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:18,509
appreciate things like that if you want

00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:20,819
to if your company wants to like

00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:22,889
donate actual equipment as long as it's

00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:24,479
good equipment and not like here are the

00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:27,089
servers we were gonna throw out do you

00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:29,149
guys want them we also like things like

00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:29,149
that

00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:38,189
does anyone else thank you for asking

00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:40,799
also when companies sent you these

00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,719
things to evaluate for respect you're

00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:44,219
free in my day just sending it like that

00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,529
and you have to figure it out or it is

00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:49,079
sending tons of internal documentation

00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:50,549
about every chipset or what's the usual

00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,059
process

00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:56,989
I only know so much about that Allison

00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:59,039
knows more so you should ask Allison I

00:37:56,989 --> 00:38:00,659
love it you can actually look at the

00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,279
requirements on the website but there

00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:03,779
are a set of requirements for the

00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:05,789
information that they have to send

00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:08,369
including the full corresponding source

00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:09,580
code and any special instructions for

00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,490
booting it

00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,050
so it is a standardized process and a

00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,700
lot of what we're looking for I mean a

00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,710
lot of the companies are sending in the

00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,780
exact same hardware so that helps we

00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,430
could just verify that it is definitely

00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,230
running Libre boot it is you know like

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,610
verify that the source they do have the

00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,020
full corresponding source code and

00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:28,210
instructions and all of that so it's

00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:32,770
it's it's basically just a lot of tick

00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:34,630
box policy checks but yeah it's it's a

00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,550
fairly standard procedure it's not very

00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,410
difficult to follow I think the way the

00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,150
thing that catches people up the most

00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,440
often is not necessarily the hardware

00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:45,160
but there's some requirements around

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,250
like your store adequately discussing

00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,480
free software software freedom and

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:52,120
things like that that sometimes confuses

00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,380
people a little but but that that gets

00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,930
straightened out pretty quickly and

00:38:53,380 --> 00:39:00,040
pretty people are always eager to to

00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:02,050
make the changes necessary and kind of

00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,430
adding to that when we're looking for

00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,590
volunteers to participate in those

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,330
processes it's not just we're looking

00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,610
for people to come into the office and

00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,980
take apart computers and say okay this

00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,720
is the chipset that this is actually has

00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,700
put on the board we're actually also

00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,500
just looking at people to like make sure

00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,780
that everything is on the application

00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,200
and that it's complete and that's a lot

00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,200
of overhead

00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:34,760
someone else you can ask other questions

00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,760
about how cool the FSF is

00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:45,860
hey you talked about how proprietary

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:50,540
software is subsidized by say the

00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:53,210
governments in he etc it's the FSF doing

00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:55,130
anything in that direction to sir to

00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:57,100
prevent that to any advocacy in that

00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:02,060
area sort of politically as they were

00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:03,680
okay so there are a few things I think

00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,240
this is actually great topic that I

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,800
would love to talk with anyone more

00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,200
about if they're interested in the

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,850
future so one of the things is that

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,770
actually like the US government is is

00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,870
really just funding the development of a

00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,710
lot of proprietary software in terms of

00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,790
things that they're making for

00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,820
themselves things that they're paying

00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:22,940
contractors to make one of the first big

00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:26,060
attempts at kind of trying to work like

00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,670
trying to fix this find out about the

00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,600
u.s. here in the United States

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,700
everything produced by the US government

00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,620
ie funded with taxpayer money is

00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,930
supposed to belong to the people in

00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:39,260
practice this isn't the case this is why

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,640
for example one many Europeans you've

00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,830
talked about space or use photos from

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,930
space they use ones from NASA because

00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:49,820
those are public domain as opposed to

00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:51,230
the ones from ice up which are not so

00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:54,410
there's this this federal open source

00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:55,940
code policy which is a good step it's

00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,980
it's by no means perfect but it is a

00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,690
good first step in working on these

00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,090
things and we participated in that

00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,230
process I wanted time comes time for a

00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:05,540
review of it we're going to be pushing

00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,790
for much higher levels of contribution

00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,230
much higher turnover in terms of when

00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,140
things are made to when things are

00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:13,700
released we've done some work as well as

00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,040
other great organizations have done work

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,510
with the believe it or not the

00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,240
Department of Defense and the Department

00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,650
of Justice within the United States that

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,630
have been to make this very us centric

00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:26,510
we would love to be doing more work

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,310
abroad we're based in the US if you

00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,540
would like to help us expand our reach

00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,440
and just like learn more about things

00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:35,570
that are happening in other places

00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:37,040
please talk with me about that so they

00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:39,290
so like the DoD has actually been doing

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,580
this really great job of creating more

00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,660
things and sharing them especially

00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,630
focused on the things that they will

00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:47,030
believe will help people the most so yes

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,490
so we're doing work on that side also

00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,890
you know when we do general work about

00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,549
DRM when we do stuff about the Digital

00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,589
Millennium Copyright

00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:57,979
right act when we do things that are

00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:59,989
just related to net neutrality we're

00:41:57,979 --> 00:42:02,390
also then putting our energy and efforts

00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:08,089
into like fighting the sorts of

00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:09,079
institutional things that exist okay so

00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:12,459
thanks Molly

00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:12,459
