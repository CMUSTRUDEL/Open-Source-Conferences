Debian new member puff I'm Erica zany

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:26,160
one of the Debian account managers

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:39,690
people who have responsibility for who

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:41,850
is a member in Debian and I'm John Widow

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,980
I'm involved with the front desk which

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,110
is sort of assigning human new members

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,719
to a pitch managers and whatever and

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,510
also keyring me in so the person who

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,829
you're one of the people who had keys to

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,840
the Debian keyring once they've gone

00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:00,120
through this process and actually join

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:08,459
the project proper who among you is an

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:12,270
application manager to three who among

00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:28,740
you is in the new member process at the

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:32,550
moment one two three you are shredding a

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:36,440
new member at any moment you can look

00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,440
inside the box and discover you're a TV

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,690
waiting for the account to be created

00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:58,709
okay we have a bit of a presentation the

00:01:50,670 --> 00:02:01,630
people who didn't raise hand recent

00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:07,760
graduates meaning

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:09,220
okay right okay other people who didn't

00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:17,720
raise hand

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:23,260
curious-looking excellent perfect as a

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,260
recent graduate find the experience and

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:33,860
on whose part not naming names but sort

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:42,459
of on some people most of people seem to

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:45,530
be characterized by consistent loft a

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:47,530
recent graduate as in you became a TV in

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:58,280
the last six months

00:02:47,530 --> 00:03:00,860
last summer so was that nine months love

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:07,670
you there's that nine months without any

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:09,830
contact oh okay yeah it was that nine

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,840
months without any contact between you

00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,070
and the person involved mean and

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,690
occasional paying debt did you get

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,480
anyone else involved or not or was it

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,959
just a waiting for the other I didn't

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,959
want to get into

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,000
okay that's by because occasionally I

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,070
mean I've certainly had at least one

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,170
experience in my front was my front desk

00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,080
hot on of discovering someone who had

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,180
sort of several months of no reply and

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,769
had only just got right into emailing

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,360
someone else about it and going that's

00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:40,100
been like you know three or four months

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,130
with no reply what's going on it's like

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,730
oh right well because once a process

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:48,080
being assigned for a per my perspective

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,739
in front desk if I assign you an

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,450
application manager it goes away from my

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,240
view you're you're dealing with someone

00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,060
else whose responsibility it is they

00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,700
to make that project process move along

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,020
and I have no visibility unless I

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,730
actively go and have a look at what

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,620
meals have been exchanged which I don't

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,750
do because I'm not micromanaging anyone

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,490
I've got other things to do but equally

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,160
it means that if there's a problem you

00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,080
have to email front desk you know if you

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,480
see a problem like that then we're not

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
always gonna fix the problem I ever on

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,030
desk fell down I apologize for that but

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,320
mmm at Debian org if you got delays in

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,420
your process that you think are

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,030
unreasonable if you're sitting waiting

00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:31,450
for more than a few weeks and there's no

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:34,210
explanation for a drop from Tesco meal

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,460
I have happily unassigned applicants

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,440
from application managers who are not

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,940
responsive and find them someone else I

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,070
can't promise I'll get you someone

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,560
immediately but we will help those

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:48,640
processes along it could be that a year

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,210
ago that wasn't you and from desk was

00:04:48,640 --> 00:05:00,370
not responsible that is we caught bad I

00:04:52,210 --> 00:05:03,820
promise it was like yeah so ideally you

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,810
would so the idea and then process is

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:11,010
supposed to take a couple of weeks at

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:17,320
the most for an average amount yeah

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:20,820
that's not ideal indeed because what is

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,070
supposed to apply only when already

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,840
ready to have an account

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,930
most of the checks should have been done

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,910
by the Advocate but we know from

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,820
experience we cannot just trust the

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,730
Advocate we've had advocates going yeah

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:45,700
had a beer with that person last night

00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:48,460
they seemed good enough not kidding it

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,510
wasn't a beer I think it was I hosted

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:56,110
them at my place

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:59,250
but anyway and and so the application

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:04,150
manager is supposed to do peer review of

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:06,400
the Advocate in theory which means

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,260
asking of you question as a person who

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,540
hasn't work with the applicant

00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:16,030
figure if indeed they look ready to have

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,570
an account and say go ahead create an

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:23,680
account and in theory either the person

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:27,340
feels like their idea member of the

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,970
project then the account then one say

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:36,100
yeah okay going or the person feels like

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:38,020
they don't they are really not feeling

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:44,080
like a member of the project then one

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:46,410
can say not yet and that should be it it

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:54,190
shouldn't really take much but then

00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:57,430
there are life issues so motivations

00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:00,930
change the routine in somebody's life

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:05,230
doesn't include them anymore there's

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:08,680
issues in acknowledging one doesn't have

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:13,360
time and always going like oh but maybe

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,400
I can tomorrow so it's like if I have

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,700
the time to give the person back then I

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,190
have the time to answer their email

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:32,190
which is sick but it kind of works like

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:46,390
that in my head it's a couple of weeks

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:48,880
stats from my personal experience on

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,420
both a aiming and from tasking three

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,280
weeks I would say is reasonably quick

00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,870
the the temp the the questions that are

00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,160
asked are worthy it does take some time

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,990
to answer the response you know people

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,190
need time to I need time to sit down and

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,260
actually do justice to reading it people

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,730
need time even ever they they know the

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,150
answers it takes time to sit I don't

00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,680
know

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,360
but something on paper so so three weeks

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:25,120
doesn't seem unreasonable two years as

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:27,400
absolutely ludicrous next is is

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:34,930
interested what he's doing cause I've

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:37,060
just painted in fact some of it was I

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:41,980
went quite the motels away vacation that

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:43,900
kind of thing I'm sure and the initial

00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,820
process of managing those expectations

00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,130
about how long the process you take is

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,530
between the applicant and the

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,420
application manager and you know if an

00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,530
applicant is busy there's no problem

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,600
about them going it's continuing a

00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,370
couple of weeks I'm away on business I

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,900
dealt with Jonathan's application and he

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,700
told me at one point look I'm gonna be

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,500
away I'm traveling on business I won't

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,730
be able to respond no problem I you know

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,350
whenever we came back we picked it up

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,270
again sometimes I'm busy and it's like

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,600
I'll take me a few days it that's fine

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:13,000
but if it gets the point that one side

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,710
isn't comfortable with the delays that

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,320
are going on if you're an application

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,290
manager and your applicant is taking you

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,030
know two months to reply then you need

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,110
to put them on hold so that you can

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,430
actually deal with somebody's ready to

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,850
go an equally if you're an applicant

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:30,130
who's you know am is taking two months

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,750
to reply and you're ready to go you need

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,100
to contact front desk so we can try and

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,100
get you someone a bit more responsive

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,670
yeah I mean absolutely the delays tend

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,320
to involve more than one person but

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,430
there are and I think there have been

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,430
issues in the past with either we

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,660
haven't had enough application managers

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,770
as of today we're actually quite given

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,510
we've got a bunch people with spare

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,220
slots we're actually on top of things so

00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,750
it's a good day for an mm buff we've got

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,600
like about four or five people free

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,620
slots and no one way to be assigned but

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,330
that's not always the case sometimes

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,470
I've had people come back and it's been

00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,420
you know a few weeks before we've had a

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,360
spare a.m. to give them so the delay

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,920
sometimes naturally happen for people

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,980
who aren't in the process but are

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,200
thinking about it is there anything you

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,610
know that's making you hold off on or

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,280
you just sort of weighing it up at the

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,770
moment or

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,010
other concerns is something we can be

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,010
doing better

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:37,400
no one wants to answer that one screen

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:40,010
Oh me I can't do stats at the moment it

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,550
requires more programming than I can win

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,550
good moment

00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:07,649
sorry if I came two minutes late I'm not

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:10,760
sure if this it's not clear to me what

00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,760
it means to be a member

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:26,399
Debian there's several well everyone

00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:31,350
that contributes to Debian is a Debian

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,329
contributor that that title is purely if

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,120
you do something you don't need to have

00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:40,470
any process to get and contributors show

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,630
up on an MDOT Debian dot org hopefully

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,720
as long as they contribute in one part

00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:49,380
of Debian where there's a data feed for

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,180
the site if one doesn't show up one is

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,130
encouraged to help create a data feed

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:58,200
for the side in that field that part of

00:11:53,130 --> 00:12:01,890
Debian and but and to build up in

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:09,720
contributor entitles you to say that you

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:12,930
contribute to W then if then there's an

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,970
official membership that gives at Debian

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:24,029
or email address and the right to vote

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:25,560
and other things which kind of makes it

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:27,570
official that a person has been

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,570
contributing to Debian for long enough

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:34,020
that they have an idea how the project

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,370
works and they should influence the

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,820
choices of the project in the project

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,459
election they can be trusted to login

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,290
into the virus Debian machines and if

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:45,990
having applaud rights they can also be

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:51,839
trusted to upload any package in their

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:53,610
unit any time so that that has some

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,410
responsibilities related to it so that

00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:01,410
in order to get that there is a process

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:04,589
where you need an advocate that says

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:07,370
that person is effectively a part of

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,440
that bein let's make it official and

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,499
then there is an application manager

00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,240
that we

00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:17,749
exchanged some emails to kind of peer

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:22,369
review what the Advocate said and then

00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:24,319
if all goes well then the ticket in an

00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:27,589
issue tracker asking for the account to

00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:30,139
be created so this is the new member

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:31,970
process so there's the Debian

00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:34,369
contributor Center at the Debian members

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:38,269
it used to be called Debian maintenance

00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:41,059
but the Debian members are not

00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:46,129
necessarily maintaining packages there

00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:50,300
may be writing web applications to run

00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:51,829
the new member process for example so

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,809
the name has been changed at some point

00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:59,269
then in the-- there's a grey area thing

00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:04,939
called the debian member sorry both the

00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:07,009
deb did have been maintainer so for

00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:13,639
extra confusion which is a tab in

00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:17,360
contributor who gets whitelisted to

00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:19,579
upload specific packages so when because

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,040
when you're about a debian member you

00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:23,869
can upload packages via a sponsor so you

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,819
give the package to a debian member that

00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:27,980
will upload it for you and the sponsor

00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:31,369
after a while can say look I've been

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,559
uploading this package of yours for two

00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:36,699
years and I'm not even looking at it

00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:43,240
so go ahead and upload it yourself and

00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:45,499
so there is a one can get whitelisted to

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:50,829
upload packages and there is a quick

00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:55,160
check to see that you have a GPG

00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:59,299
encryption key that is has been signed

00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:02,929
by someone so you are somehow distinct

00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:07,420
person you have a reputation that is not

00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:10,519
completely anonymous to the project and

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:13,910
you would sign an email saying that you

00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:18,019
agree to uphold the debian social

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,779
contract in what you do because you get

00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:23,059
some responsibility so there's like at

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:24,870
least you agree to do it the way they've

00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:26,250
been expect things to be done

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,960
that's kind of a gray area but that's

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:34,640
not an official member of the project

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:37,380
it's more like to smooth and sort of

00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,480
decrease the load on the sponsor who may

00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,940
sponsor other packages for you but for

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,250
that one it's clear you know to do it

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,520
and then after if somebody's being that

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:53,940
they've been maintainer for a while and

00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:55,560
become an urban developer an interest in

00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,770
getting a particular package in the

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,300
Debian and that starts as far as it goes

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,100
you know they want a minty in that

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,529
package there they'll do the best they

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,060
can they have no interest particularly

00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,980
in voting or getting involved in the

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,839
heavyweight stuff so Debbie maintainer

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,420
ship is was introduced as a lightweight

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,890
way that you can you can scratch that

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,710
edge without having to go through the

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,000
other beds if you don't want to these

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,860
days it's seen as a good stepping stone

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,500
on the way it is sort of getting full DD

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,300
ship but there's no problem with

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,400
sticking around as a TM for as long as

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,070
it's you and equally Debian contributors

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,610
it's a lightweight recognition of

00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,110
someone's involvement with the project

00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,400
he's dipping in a night or is doing

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,779
something that they don't feel they need

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,589
to go through the hoops to get to this

00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:42,450
extra stage and you know again we've not

00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:44,310
got a method of recognizing the fact

00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,770
that and the great work that lots of

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:49,100
people do without going through all the

00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,360
formal hoops of the new member process

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,470
so it's a choice thing you get to choose

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,570
where you want to go to and

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,570
unfortunately as there is slightly more

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,810
rights and the privileges associated

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,370
with that particular level of membership

00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,400
there's a little bit more process to go

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,400
through

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:13,000
maybe I can make statistics got carried

00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,000
away

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,380
I mean it is a ball from prepared slide

00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,240
so we're kind of interested if anyone

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,420
wants to ask something or make a comment

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:48,630
or anything we can sort of help out with

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:53,260
it's kind of an informal session started

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:55,450
no there's there's a set of templates so

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,120
there are a set of templates that the am

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,280
are encouraged to use and I'm sand I'd

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,070
in terms of asking the questions and

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,660
walking through them and I've been doing

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,350
this on and off for years depending on

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,060
my activity levels and I still use those

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,330
and I know of at least one instance

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,320
someone told me about where their

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,820
applicant had actually already

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,050
downloaded them in their in public yet

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,550
you can go and look at these they're

00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,960
they're the applicant had already

00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,670
downloaded them before they entered the

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,260
process had worked out their answers to

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,730
all of them and it was a very quick

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,770
process because they cut and pasted

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,600
their answers prepared in into the meal

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,550
since like well that's fine that shows

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,260
initiative that shows you know how to

00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,360
find stuff in Debian that was their own

00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,650
answer so their own words of like this

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,790
is the answer to the question they'd

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,490
have the time to go and look at or

00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:41,530
whatever none of this is meant to trip

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,570
people up so so I'm in favor of the

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:46,210
templates and also gives things but yeah

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,620
the a the am process is pretty much you

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,180
can login to the site and you can say

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,370
I've got a spare slot assigned me

00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,020
someone I'm from from their point of

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,400
view with the new AM was sort of trying

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,900
to sign you someone who we think it's a

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,470
bit easier or someone you know maybe we

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,280
know it's got some highly visual

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,480
contributions which means it'll be a bit

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,730
of an easier process for you to walk

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,380
through is your first one but yeah maybe

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,860
maybe we should be bad at that I don't I

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,860
don't know

00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:19,770
so there's contributors maintainer and

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,950
members contributors and maintainer

00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:26,630
aren't necessarily members but all

00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,630
members are contributors in some way

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,770
contributors covers anyone who

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,830
contributes to Debian so no so if you

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:38,220
you file a bug you comment on a bug you

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:40,620
contribute on the mailing list you you

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,779
know mint in something in the package or

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,429
you whatever it is contributors of

00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:46,740
Debian dot Oracle will track any

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:51,230
contribution so that's the the superset

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:54,450
of everyone a debian maintainer is

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:57,510
someone who has the rights to upload one

00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:00,090
or more specific packages so they have

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:03,120
upload rights and a full-on member who

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,620
can either have uploading rights or no

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,380
uploading voting rights is someone who's

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,380
actually able to vote in the project and

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:13,380
able to get sort of vocal access to sort

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,909
of the project resources and it's

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,309
important to note that we have got this

00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:19,140
concept of an on uploading debian member

00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,190
which we didn't previously have which

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,809
meant that some people who are maybe

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,429
only doing documentation and we had a

00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:24,899
process that would have you know asked

00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:26,309
you put your packaging skills when what

00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:28,110
you wanted to contribute to Debian was

00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,370
nothing to do with that side of things

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,490
and they were inappropriate questions

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:35,399
now I can go the full step of getting

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,840
access and having voting rights and we

00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:38,279
still do some checks about you know do

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,100
you understand free software do you

00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,450
understand the logic behind Debian and

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,370
all of that stuff to make sure that

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,730
people try and fit in with the ethos of

00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:49,289
the project but you don't need to be

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,820
even highly technical in order to be

00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,559
able to go down that path I know that

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,480
there are people have been involved with

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,190
organizing Gabe comp for years who have

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,020
gone down that path I've been recognized

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,409
for their valuable contributions to the

00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,409
project

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,450
go together because that new membership

00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:44,850
so the table at the top shows the

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,200
various rights and the graph at the

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:52,400
bottom sort of shows how you can move

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:52,400
between things does that help questions

00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:02,309
do people spend a certain amount of time

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:05,419
or how much is average amount of time

00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:10,590
that people spend as a contributor

00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:15,330
before applying for membership or that

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:19,110
process just depends on the total office

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:21,690
basis train obviously don't someone come

00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,400
in cold into the member process that

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,169
sort of any experience of debian and

00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,130
whatever but sometimes people I see

00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:31,380
people who are I'm gonna go down the new

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,850
member route but I've got some packages

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,110
I'm already uploading so I'm going to do

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:38,880
the debian maintainer process and then

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,350
in parallel or very soon afterwards they

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,210
start the membership process because of

00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,030
what they want to do there's someone who

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,530
went through it recently who's going to

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,169
be uploading a lot of new packages as

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,970
part of the team they're involved with

00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:53,309
and it doesn't make sense for them to go

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,600
through the new maintainer process

00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:56,820
because that's a white listing on

00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,380
packages not on new packages so they're

00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,669
going straight to the member process

00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,190
because that's more applicable in that

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:04,230
case so it's a case-by-case basis what

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,880
does this person want to achieve what

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:09,210
sir all right their existing comfort

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,070
level I think you would need to have

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,630
some involvement of the contributor

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,760
stage before you get to any of the later

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,080
stages but but where that sets and how

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,039
long you have to do that depends very

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,039
much in the situation

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:44,600
I fail at sequel never mind that's okay

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:51,250
I was feeling the sequel yesterday yeah

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:53,510
a spinner point sighs so the the path to

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,550
leading or stepping back to happiness to

00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,260
go to emeritus and there is sort of a

00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,179
light way of coming back in so if you're

00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,559
not active and you sort of go home let's

00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,929
talk about I'm gonna give up the right

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,670
side because I'm not using them you know

00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:05,870
you can gracefully they become emeritus

00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,179
and then whenever you wanna come back

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,800
it's a much lighter wear process so you

00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,910
know you've obviously heard you knew

00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,200
this stuff before it depends how long

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,809
you've been a way that maybe there's a

00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,610
new technical questions we need to ask

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:20,090
you but in Jeff Watts a little process

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:22,220
to come back and definitely much prefer

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,660
people who don't have time for Debian

00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,900
and in order to stand up and say I

00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:29,090
rather go completely missing PGs darn or

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:33,220
walk out whether or not they're still

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:37,780
all right yeah

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:40,120
it is that as soon as somebody knows

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,340
that the public we actually that in the

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,580
next few months that it makes sense to

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:49,330
be either settle self-application if one

00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,919
knows they'll be coming back or become

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,559
actors if one doesn't know when

00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,630
definitely be coming back which really

00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:57,549
helps also reducing the attack surface

00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,740
of that because each active that will

00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:06,010
member can login into every active into

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:13,630
a veteran machine so we don't want

00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:15,340
someone to become inactive leave their

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,230
computer somewhere because they don't

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,100
even remember they have access to living

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:23,100
machines and suddenly their SH key is

00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,100
somewhere

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,820
for the people who've been through the

00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:45,179
nm process recently how was the website

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:47,789
was it understandable I mean it was

00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:52,679
because you became the developer

00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:56,279
drawings where were things that were

00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:59,580
unclear or saying for people who

00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:01,499
advocated people for people who became

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,149
they be a member if there's any feedback

00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:06,210
on the website something you didn't

00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:07,499
understand I would like to know is

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,149
anyone the room actually done an

00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,149
application for someone on the website

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,809
some of the other similar processes I've

00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:32,400
had to deal with in a corporate

00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:41,040
situation to do it that way

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:42,240
okay well by his fingerprints so so I

00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,250
don't know who's been involved in

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,980
process in the past but the previously

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,050
there was a lot of manual tracking of

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,300
what what why people four people were

00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,760
along in the situation it was a manual

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,110
send an email with an application to a

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,790
mailing list which works for some people

00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,350
but it's quite hard to track the

00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,809
progress of what's going on so that the

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,670
new website hopefully solve some of the

00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:04,170
problems about seeing things being

00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,990
active or things getting lost in the

00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:09,300
cracks by making it all trackable in one

00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:12,030
place I mean you can go and see you know

00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:17,460
what what pieces are required if I show

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:19,800
you actually I can show you I've been

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:24,360
trying to automate everything that can

00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:26,870
possibly automated so that everything

00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:32,820
that feels like bureaucracy would be

00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:35,010
kind of as painless as possible but some

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,950
ating bureaucracy may leave coronet

00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:40,080
cases out or something so yeah so this

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,480
is a view I see as a front desk person

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,670
and the really cool thing is that it

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,340
tracks sort of all of the requirements

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:49,559
so I can see that these people need

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:52,320
something come with their keys Dave

00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,280
needs in am assign but then he's got a

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,420
problem with his key so that's why I

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,620
hasn't got to that but it's very clear

00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,840
for me to go right this is where this

00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,059
process is and at the bottom I can see

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,500
right these people have free slots so

00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,880
because it's all tracked in the website

00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,760
now you can actually walk through your

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,500
process and you can see you you know

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,179
that Dave can see exactly which of his

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,010
requirements he has and doesn't have an

00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:12,540
under where he is in it and you can sort

00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,340
of go into the process and you can

00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,290
annotate a log and you can see your

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,520
advocates and it's in one place and you

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,730
can work out what's going on which

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,260
wasn't the case before so if anyone

00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,030
who's been through the the process may

00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,890
be one when when did you move over but a

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:31,610
year and a half ago or was it more

00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:31,610
recently he knows

00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:43,959
process one was started June 2016

00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:46,809
okay so we've had about just over a year

00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:48,219
of the new website and certainly from my

00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,229
perspective it seems you're moving along

00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:52,299
reasonably well and it is much easier to

00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:55,839
track where people are on who needs

00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:57,700
attention so if you've heard bad things

00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:01,539
about nm and that's put you off in the

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:04,089
past please consider giving it a try and

00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:11,919
as I say we do contact front desk if

00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:13,329
you've got delays or problems or that's

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,299
a much much better chart than a year ago

00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:18,039
yeah I mean that's those those three are

00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:19,869
the people out of carnet snotty not to

00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:21,489
be fair we did a bunch of stuff

00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:23,139
yesterday in the day before in order to

00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:25,869
get that but there were you know a

00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:28,690
handful of people I think there were

00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:29,919
four DDS who had keys out of to the

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,899
keyring yesterday and we're just waiting

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,749
for the DSA staff and they're just like

00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:38,259
what six or seven DMS yeah those three

00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:39,519
we're not the only people in the cube if

00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:40,899
there's all those assigned to

00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,759
application manager yeah that's true

00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:44,259
those are the three that are sitting not

00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:46,629
waiting for an application manager so

00:29:44,259 --> 00:30:02,669
they're ones that are actually people to

00:29:46,629 --> 00:30:02,669
applicants okay

00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:13,200
I just joined so please repeat the

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:14,669
questions in the channel yeah okay so

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:38,850
this is the stuff that's currently

00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:40,950
outstanding the currently open ones so

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,510
this is the list I'm sorry it's quite

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,880
small from that so it's the process is

00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,649
currently open and we it's it's not

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,539
because of lack of AMS at the moment we

00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:50,700
actually have spare am's these are

00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:56,580
people who are in the process of talking

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:59,909
to AMS or some of them need keys so

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:03,210
they're the if we look at Jeff just to

00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:05,669
pick a nominee them in the room this

00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:07,260
this yeah yeah so there's so there you

00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:09,450
go so we don't come to him against this

00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,159
but equally this won't appear on my list

00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,860
until it's actually sat on the new

00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,630
maintainer list for five days so it

00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,309
gives anyone the chance to sort of look

00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,929
at it and go I want actually there's

00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,130
some issues or there's a chance for

00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:22,799
people who are active in the project to

00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:25,250
see a process when it starts before it

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,029
actually gets kicked off properly

00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,169
unequally they'll need to call an

00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:29,399
article you can see he doesn't have any

00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:30,840
advocates because he's literally only

00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:35,340
checked on that so someone should sort

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,149
that out from I just try and look at the

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:44,340
other one to see if there anything

00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:51,710
obvious anyone else in the room on that

00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:51,710
list you've been assigned in am

00:31:52,039 --> 00:32:31,639
I did promise and Rico says he doesn't

00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:34,369
like people saying good work and

00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:37,129
Enrico's work on this website makes my

00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:39,080
job a hell of a lot easier it for me no

00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:41,419
it's I can go and click and assign you

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,580
Nami can see who's free it streamlines

00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:47,570
the process it reduces the friction to

00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,830
me going in and as an am checking where

00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,200
I am in the process as a front desk

00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:53,659
person progressing people throughout the

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,039
process it it means that I I know I can

00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:56,869
go and spend five minutes to do some

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,369
useful work in Debian when I've got them

00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:59,840
here and there rather having to go I

00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:02,710
need a block of two hours in order to

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:07,090
try and track down what's going on so

00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:13,340
yeah thanks I'm quite proud that until

00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:16,519
the intent and until these three are

00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:18,529
satisfied basically which means you say

00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:21,889
you want to become something somebody

00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:24,200
says I agree and you say you agree to do

00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:27,320
things in Debian until those three are

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,619
satisfied there's no load on front desk

00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,659
which there's a robot that takes care of

00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:35,629
pinging and closing if nothing happens

00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:37,190
in two weeks that helped I just want to

00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:39,049
scroll down the page the process is

00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,399
closed in the last 30 days because

00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:41,330
that's kind of a bit more interesting

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,799
because it's all sure that we're

00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,210
actually achieving stuff it's not as big

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,619
as the list of outstanding stuff but a

00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:50,119
door show that a bunch of people have

00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:52,070
had either their requirements closed

00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:53,899
because they didn't get as far as

00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,369
getting at the Advocate and everything

00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:57,409
so you know we weed people out whenever

00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:59,509
they don't get those steps so it doesn't

00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:01,639
eat into the rest of the processes time

00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:03,889
but equally you know there's a bunch of

00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,720
dm's there's two uploading DDS that are

00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:07,800
in that list

00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,990
you know things are getting done

00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,669
hopefully that this is that public and

00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,620
the people go and look at that yeah yeah

00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:15,390
so so these are the nm Debian or org

00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,040
slash process only column that's not

00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,929
public and shouldn't be seen by anyone

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,730
he's ft comments where he may say this

00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:28,790
person is really bad but don't tell

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:28,790
anyone but it's not really used so fine

00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:41,750
oh actually you can impersonate someone

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:46,919
I think to make sure that you are like

00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:48,990
non-farm desk person impersonate someone

00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:55,230
if you click on that yeah no but it does

00:34:48,990 --> 00:35:05,100
impersonating show me that one Jeff I'm

00:34:55,230 --> 00:35:08,300
gonna pretend to be used okay so yeah so

00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:11,880
so I'm not Jeff Republicans the FB

00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:15,570
comment column should become if it's not

00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,280
okay so yes this is what what you would

00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,990
see is a thing but you you sin Chi see

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,570
all a lot information except for the FDS

00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,640
you can log in and see probably busy the

00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:29,420
processes you can see where you sit and

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,420
all of that stuff just to go by to being

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:38,160
as an applicant you see all of this so

00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,599
you can see missing requirements and you

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,010
can see sort of the requirements at the

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,210
bottom on whether they've been approved

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:46,859
and where they are so you get this

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:48,960
viewpoint as well as front desk which

00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:50,130
hopefully helps and there's delays that

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,619
you can sort of see where you're in the

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,760
process it doesn't solve unresponsive

00:35:52,619 --> 00:36:01,890
people but it does like you know that

00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:25,890
there's someone progress is anybody here

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:29,190
looking for guidance on is that straight

00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:31,020
sponsor yes love you know do you have a

00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,059
regular sponsor via regular involvement

00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:45,990
or is this you've uploaded at once or

00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:48,390
what stage you are than this doesn't

00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,849
need a precursor to deputy ownership

00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:53,670
would sound like the reader going died

00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:56,250
for what it's worth the member left

00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,809
three mentors yes so I'm told mentors is

00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,339
working reasonably well achieving the

00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:02,579
initial stage so if you've got a pocket

00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:03,990
you want upload that's you you need

00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,400
someone to sponsor your outlook because

00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,049
you're not a Debbie maintainer I don't

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,010
know if there's anyone from them in the

00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:09,869
room but I'm speaking to someone

00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,490
yesterday you said there's actually a

00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:12,990
reasonably active group of people there

00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,160
who will pick up packages and upload it

00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,180
so that's definitely a good way to get

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,920
started the idea would be that at some

00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,930
point you'll have worked with some

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,670
people who feel you're doing good work

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,839
that they're not checking your packages

00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,970
because you know you're talking about

00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:28,380
and they will be able to advocate you

00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,880
for Debbie maintainer ship which will

00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,549
then mean you have the right W with that

00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,720
package by yourself and that I would

00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:35,720
imagine as the next step

00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:46,290
siddhappa ventures directly from the

00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:48,750
factory and that's I mean there are a

00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:51,360
bunch of teams so I've seen people who

00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,070
are interested in particular areas go

00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,030
and find a team to get involved with

00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,910
which sort of puts you in the

00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,290
contributor bracket and then someone

00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,970
else may be worried about the uploads

00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,770
and then the team some of the team will

00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,620
sponsor you so for the there's package

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:06,210
pearl for example which does perl

00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,250
modules and Pro related things and

00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,050
there's equally there's Ruby and there's

00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:12,780
you know the common languages and

00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,520
there's packaged electronics I know has

00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:17,460
a team of people doing packages related

00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,710
to sort of electronic stuff and you can

00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,690
get involved they're contributing within

00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,010
that environment hopefully get some

00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,780
support from the rest of the team about

00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,040
how things are done and how they do

00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,540
things and someone else are worried

00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,250
about uploading it so that's a that's a

00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,490
good way if you have a particular area

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,660
of interest to get involved with some

00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,910
other people who are interesting on same

00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,110
thing generally if you are working if

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,340
you're working together with other

00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:40,590
people in that being at some point

00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:46,070
somebody will say you why don't you get

00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:51,030
an account or if being doing stuff for

00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:54,120
if you think like you belong you can ask

00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:57,690
people how about I get an account the

00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:00,630
only problem we have is and it's a it's

00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:03,930
a weird corner case is people who become

00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:07,290
Debian maintainer and spend five years

00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:09,480
maintaining those two packages and then

00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:11,730
they would say yeah but I wouldn't mind

00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,070
I would like to vote now and suddenly

00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:16,530
nobody's been working with them for the

00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:19,260
last four years and they can't find an

00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:27,930
advocate and I have no idea how to fix

00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:31,410
that so make sure that if you contribute

00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:33,300
to that bean you keep having some social

00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,350
network inside that bean which is a good

00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,930
idea anyway

00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:40,470
because you don't want to be in there

00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:44,030
being alone if you want to have some

00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:44,030
friends that know what

00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:39,490
because it's easy to find sponsors it's

00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:41,410
easy to find people to talk to do we

00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:45,789
have a lack of clarity or when people

00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:48,220
should think of applying you listen what

00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:51,400
we'd like to see at least I think is

00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:53,349
there is people shouldn't really be

00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,990
thinking of applying as a new member

00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:57,990
until you think you're ready technically

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:11,069
we used to have a problem years ago

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:18,359
sometimes this this view still holds but

00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:21,730
getting into new maintainer could take

00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:23,859
months and months maybe years so as soon

00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:26,200
as you can work out how to generate a

00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:30,069
PGP key you should apply that's the

00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,829
worst way possible we really want people

00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:34,990
applying into the new member process who

00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:36,940
are frankly already ready we're not

00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:38,619
trying to train people that at this

00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:41,380
stage we're not expecting you to be

00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:43,270
waiting for years you should be ready

00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:47,220
and already have the skills is now just

00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:49,900
a case of I was verifying those skills

00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:52,119
I'd like to counter that slightly in

00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,750
that I've had some feedback from people

00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:56,220
who sort of view that they have to be

00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,680
absolutely on top of everything before

00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,300
they can start the new member process

00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,560
and have to know the answer to every

00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,599
question off the top of their head

00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,760
before they start the new member process

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,230
that's absolutely not true yes you need

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,770
to be absolutely comfortable the project

00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:13,440
you need to feel whatever but I'm fine

00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,970
as an am with people coming and saying I

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,910
don't quite understand the question or

00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:19,200
I'm not quite sure I'm trying down

00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,619
through it you know it's a it's a

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,380
conversation rather than a test it's a

00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:27,030
do you know your way around Debian and

00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,030
when you don't know the answer you know

00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:31,770
where to ask or where to look or or both

00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:34,440
of these things and that's that's

00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:35,520
perfectly okay unequally there's some of

00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,400
the questions that sort of say make sure

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,310
your packages are in good shape and

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,810
again I've seen people say I'm waiting

00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,880
for them to be perfect I'm waiting for

00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,160
my packages to have new bugs and

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,840
everything to be okay and it's like no

00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,010
make sure they're in decent shape make

00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,380
sure you're happy with them and you

00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:54,750
think they they're you know ready to

00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:57,240
ship as part of stable but but software

00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:59,180
sucks it's not bug free ever you know

00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,170
you've always got bugs in your packages

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,910
whether they've been fined yet or not

00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,670
it's another issue so so don't worry

00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:08,580
about that perfection thing about the

00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:10,890
process if you've got an AM is being a

00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,330
real stickler and whatever then they're

00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,130
wrong and it should be a conversation

00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:16,830
and it should be something I mean I

00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:19,349
learn from every single new member I

00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:21,240
talked to you all have different views

00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:22,859
in the world than I do and I really

00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,440
enjoy sort of having that conversation

00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:27,450
and I'll make people who I know know

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,710
free software just put it in their own

00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,089
words for me so I can have the

00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,440
conversation which I admit slightly

00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:33,030
selfishness does make the process a

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,740
little longer but I'm not trying to test

00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,599
anyone I'm trying to have a conversation

00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,180
and I'm trying to do the social side of

00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,099
things so so don't worry about knowing

00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,380
all the answers do you know feel

00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:45,000
comfortable in Debian but you just need

00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,650
to know where to look and who to ask and

00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,710
sometimes absolutely yeah when I said

00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,720
technically capable a chunk of that is

00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,520
also knowing when you don't know the

00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,550
answer but were to look it up how to

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,640
find it yeah so again question actually

00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:01,349
to me clarifying so what skills are we

00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,700
looking for before you get into new

00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:07,380
maintainer or so a new member process

00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,230
basically do you have that if you're

00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,140
looking to do

00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:13,600
you package up loads do you know how to

00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,220
do those package uploads do you know how

00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,109
to manage your package do you know how

00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,530
to deal with bug reports that kind of

00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:19,630
thing

00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:22,030
yeah and in general as a more broad

00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:26,260
attitude packaging or mound packaging

00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:29,760
whether it's a problem if you try and do

00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:32,560
something and look up how to do it later

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,590
it's not a problem if before doing

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:39,180
something that you've never done you are

00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:41,800
able to look up information ask around

00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,660
so make sure that you know what you're

00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,490
doing when you're doing it not

00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:47,080
necessarily when you become a Debian

00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:53,109
developer who's that bean is too broad

00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:54,760
and as to when to apply now we have we

00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:59,109
had one minute laugh about one and a

00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:02,310
half minutes ago with regards to when to

00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:06,130
apply it's when you feel like you belong

00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:08,859
when you need it like you need to do an

00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:12,490
amuse for mass bug-fixing you need

00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:16,510
access to some Debian machines to commit

00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:18,660
to web pages or something so yeah when

00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:21,790
if you like you belong when you need it

00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,859
yeah if your current status and debian

00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:26,560
is hampering your ability to get stuff

00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:28,119
done on debian that's a pretty good sign

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,560
that you you should be trying to move to

00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:31,450
a different one on the fioor gonna come

00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,310
through and go I'm doing all this stuff

00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:36,880
and I'm having to ask someone else to

00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:38,650
sponsor all my uploads absolutely you

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,780
know apply for for new member or

00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,130
whatever or if you're you know dealing

00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,480
with a package that has a lot of churn

00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:45,220
in and you're trying to get in a good

00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,869
ship and you have to ask someone a

00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,030
sponsorship then absolutely ask for

00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:51,070
Debian maintainer status if you ever

00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:53,460
find that where you're at in Debian

00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:56,710
hampers your ability to get stuff done

00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,940
that that's - well it's a red flag about

00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,470
you definitely should be changing you

00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,180
can do before that but if you ever get

00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:02,650
to that point absolutely come and talk

00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,440
to someone if you're not sure about

00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:08,290
so Jonathan in IRC says that for him

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,359
with an AM hat on is the thing he wants

00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:12,820
to know is does this Apple can know when

00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:14,770
to stop and seek help because at that

00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:19,840
point he knows he can trust him not to

00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:21,640
just break things so of course Debian is

00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,490
abord Church there was many

00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:26,529
different ways of contributing and being

00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:29,559
a project member as though all people in

00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:31,480
it not everybody knows everything if

00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,339
anyone claims to know everything they

00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,760
are clearly lying to you do not trust

00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:40,119
them you know you know we work together

00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,880
fundamentally we all tend to find new

00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:44,410
stuff every day every week whatever well

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,150
we you know we have to admit we don't

00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:48,039
know stuff and you go you go and work on

00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:52,510
things we will be totally hypocritical

00:46:48,039 --> 00:47:47,890
to expect new member applicants to be

00:46:52,510 --> 00:47:49,390
any different we will done thanks folks

00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,759
if you do have any more questions there

00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,720
were plenty people around to you know

00:47:51,759 --> 00:47:55,480
come talk to us

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,250
