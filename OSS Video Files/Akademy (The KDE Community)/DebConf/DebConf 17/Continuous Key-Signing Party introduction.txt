okay hello and welcome to probably the

00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:15,160
most boring but some some house for some

00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:18,369
reason quite a dissipated obsessional

00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,070
the geese are designing party production

00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:26,339
so if they say about the party to be

00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:29,050
good I hope a justed it will give some

00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,579
details to what what we are doing and

00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,800
why were doing it because our I knows

00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:36,310
there's always some new people but the

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,469
exact needs to be quite short right so

00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:42,690
we're here to try to strengthen the

00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:45,489
wealth trust the web of trust is a

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,079
construct I will show some pictures of

00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:49,079
it of this

00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:06,920
betrayus okay a it's a construct we

00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,980
having an Indian that gives an

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,630
appearance to who we are socially but

00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:16,640
technically as well and different parts

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:21,730
of the required to interact with us

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,350
mainly well I I'm here I took this

00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:28,450
position because I'm part of the killing

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:32,690
main people responsible for the carry a

00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:34,790
seat you're not that certain there in

00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,590
the bill we are the the queueing

00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,100
maintenance team so we are responsible

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,979
for holding for for saying which these

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,119
are part of the hearing that doesn't

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:49,960
mean that that we trust you unlimited we

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:54,290
check that you comply with our they say

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:56,450
requirements the information from the

00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,520
kiss is also used by the front desk that

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:03,500
say well the people that handle all the

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,330
processes and all the transitions

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:11,690
between states of individuals in their

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:13,850
relation to the project and well the

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,300
Debian infrastructure several four

00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:21,230
computers require a four different

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,890
actions for you to have a key in one of

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,500
the activity weeks so if you are a

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,290
Debian developer your your key is say

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,569
one of the Kings carry a Debian

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,370
maintainer or an oral hearing they will

00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:38,360
developer done uploading on a third

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:42,830
theory a few weeks exist but a but they

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:46,130
do not have an active role when we could

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,650
talk and if they're interested we will

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:51,280
talk more about what is a web of trust a

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,350
created work trust what is a strong

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,230
said what is the connected said there

00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:00,220
are many things related to late but well

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:03,160
this is just a funny fun to show who we

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:07,300
are this is the photo way not not a new

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:10,900
one but I haven't created any one of the

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:13,530
Libyan developers keyring a one and a

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:19,330
half years ago after winning some major

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:23,950
adjustments and well each other

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:27,010
the signature ages each each line is a

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:34,510
signature and they basically it shows

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:37,750
how how new or how old is trust the

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,840
notes that are the people and this is a

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,390
photo of the the keyring we are using

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:50,319
for this particular design of course

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:52,810
this just looks like a black mess well a

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,280
tangled thing but the important thing

00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:01,739
here is that you find who you are and

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,739
who you are connected to I prepared an

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:12,100
active link it repair this so each of

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:17,169
you can find yourselves this is me for

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:21,669
example and you can find for example

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:22,630
here who I am connected to hey I will go

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:27,400
back to this in a minute

00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:30,310
this should be useful to know well what

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,590
the next thing is this is hanging party

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:37,750
well were the next steps for it for you

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:42,250
is so before going further I have you

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:49,749
open this have you all got your lucky

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:52,239
number do you all agree with it

00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:57,189
of course this is not enough because

00:04:52,239 --> 00:05:00,069
it's very very easy to teach if I just

00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:02,379
do this head I mean the reason that I

00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:05,619
mean shown this is that we have to check

00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:07,599
this number matches for all of us all

00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:15,429
welcome to do a group reading of the

00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:17,919
stream because well if your key was sent

00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:20,739
to an even a who organized organized

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,669
this assigning party your key should be

00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:28,959
in this file that I got to the KSP that

00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:31,989
vc7 did not DLC and I want to ensure

00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,219
this key this cell file is the same for

00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:37,719
each and one of us each each one of us

00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:40,509
to make sure that we all have exactly

00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:42,399
same pilot in case some some of if

00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:47,050
somebody is not familiar with what

00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:51,009
Charlotte o56 some does shuttle 256 is a

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:54,629
hashing algorithm does well it basically

00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:58,809
marks anything to a strain of this size

00:05:54,629 --> 00:06:04,149
256 bits and makes it extremely unlikely

00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:05,949
to find something similar so a even if

00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:11,019
you have a very small pool education in

00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:14,829
your file a the the hash then the number

00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:17,889
they yielded by you in your shuttle 256

00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:19,569
from your file will be wildly different

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,789
than this one it's extremely unlikely

00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:25,079
you will have something as for me a

00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:32,139
saying I did here check just to DG's

00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:34,839
write a so I will I will ask people to

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:37,899
start reading this from your copies not

00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:40,269
from mine because I know what what the

00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:43,389
number sees what the knurl what the

00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:45,969
numbers are but we should all check this

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,860
from either your computer or your

00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:51,789
printed page where you already wrote

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,860
this down so a it would be nice to have

00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:59,309
two people read at once but of course

00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:03,309
this is very prone to timing errors but

00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:08,589
if we start human and you each one which

00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:11,379
one a one digit or letter from their

00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:20,649
copy we should all verify it's the same

00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:28,349
one one please continue this way if no

00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:28,349
is six 100 cents next

00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:44,919
see people we need the audience to get

00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:51,829
engaged

00:07:44,919 --> 00:08:01,609
is somebody sick man sorry lover okay I

00:07:51,829 --> 00:08:04,039
wouldn't repeat myself right we don't

00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:06,739
want everybody to say just one digit so

00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:09,679
yep some people please more than three

00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:15,519
or four a proteomic folks and they brief

00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:15,519
maybe is for the record four digit each

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:32,560
six one f8c nine one five two nine nine

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,560
[Music]

00:08:34,449 --> 00:09:02,720
seven B a B D a five three three eight

00:08:51,529 --> 00:09:08,860
three six eight nine five zero two zero

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,860
one five FB

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:29,050
mmm 1973 f7 to a f5 d c-- eight eight

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,999
eight nine seven two five two thank you

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:35,290
very much

00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:38,079
everybody's okay for those of you who

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,899
who are not into this the thing is we

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,089
want to be sure that when we check

00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:46,389
identities that will be I will explain

00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:48,639
that that as a next step we are already

00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:53,379
all of us are checking the same time

00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:56,410
that a contains similar swings for each

00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:59,170
of us data because that they decided

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,990
education is the closest the closest we

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:05,680
have to a verification of identity in

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:11,499
the Damier project so who should I ever

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:15,220
sign with well this picture I sent you

00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:18,819
this shows Mikey in the center of course

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:22,930
each of your is in the center and a it

00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:26,980
shows that the links with with people

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:31,899
you have already cross-eyed or maybe say

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:35,519
this one this one only has one signature

00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,519
so I can check here for example

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,200
[Music]

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:50,670
here at have signed a Devon baniszewski

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:54,750
but he hasn't signed mine so I like an

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:58,560
approximant as a simple let's say we do

00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:02,160
the cross signing here it is a example

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,750
around I a viola Sabrina assigned me but

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,670
I didn't sign I see

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:12,060
so I should tell a God got him

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:14,550
verify identity and say it again but

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,510
it's more important if I approach people

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:20,990
who what who who who shall I identity I

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:24,630
trust say I know who and humble brace

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:27,600
but I haven't cross sign with him so I

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:30,420
should approach him and and the exchange

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,810
signatures so if somebody is my friend I

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,700
have not cross sign I am aware of I

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,280
trust this identity I should do a cross

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:42,570
signing if another person is many hops

00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:46,770
away from me I say we can see this shape

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:49,530
here of the keyring where it has spikes

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:56,440
and then people far away who is this

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:59,060
person this person is on the far edge

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,400
[Music]

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,130
Simon Simon mobility should be signed by

00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,110
me because it's quite far so if I sign

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:10,320
kissed you if I cross sign with him it

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:14,880
will make the keep the whole set more

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:19,820
coherent or if somebody is isolated or

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:22,920
weakly connected say a little ground we

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,620
will have no etc and all those people

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,840
that are not part of the main block we

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,970
should get them in there are joining the

00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,130
listening party because the one who gets

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:36,690
in the queue of course we have to check

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:39,110
they are we with a claim to be if you

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,029
are one of those people that are not

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,700
connected orders are not connected

00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:48,200
please do not turned out and they

00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:51,010
contact us say a to a as many of us as

00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:55,279
possible so you can get inside the

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:57,440
destruction right and we don't need

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,510
everybody to be the center there's no

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,320
need for everybody to have a very very

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:10,430
high brand of signatures but it's good

00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:12,610
to have more more than 1 to 5 signatures

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,500
right it's better to be more connected

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,779
maybe you didn't get it very tight maybe

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,430
you your your tea is not part of the of

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:20,750
this side what should you do well of

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,120
course you're not in this matter because

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:26,300
I didn't know of you when I made this

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,829
but prints up sleeves of having your

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:33,290
name and your full fingerprint a with

00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:35,899
those you can will change check

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,870
identities exchange signatures with with

00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:42,019
other people a if you have your sleeves

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:45,019
and you have the same file and we trust

00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:48,170
this file then you don't have to get see

00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:53,660
if it slips from everybody who's to you

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:56,510
cross sign right then what is trust I'm

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:59,149
talking about check identity what does

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,870
checking identity mean some people trust

00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:04,760
government if you say issued IDs okay I

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,339
can tell you from the day from this

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,170
moment I don't have my

00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:10,360
and will not bring my passport to that

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,939
cause I have other credentials if you

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,220
need them or other ID cards for the from

00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,999
different after that I I don't care too

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,550
much about them

00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:21,220
many people trust government-issued IDs

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:25,540
this is a personal thing each person

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:29,050
should put their trust where it's a word

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:32,199
they trust I prefer to trust the person

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,999
so for example if I just met somebody I

00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:37,120
will not sign you probably this year

00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:40,959
unless we have some time together and I

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,259
I can rely on getting to know you or

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,149
recognizing you later on but again the

00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:49,660
guidelines it depends on each person

00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:51,370
your scheme how do you validate the

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,259
person that's in front of you how how do

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:57,699
you evaluate why do you trust somebody

00:14:53,259 --> 00:15:02,290
to be the the person is claimed to be we

00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:03,879
are a certain identity of people so and

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,879
it's a serious thing it is something

00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:09,699
that we should take seriously but

00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,480
there's no one else to do it every

00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:15,550
single proposal is probably the planning

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,399
so hey well I guess I still have some

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:23,709
minutes in case somebody wants to ask or

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:25,809
comment or whatever but that's it for me

00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:29,499
that's a that's the introduction I will

00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:31,990
make sure to put a copy of the SHA we

00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:34,389
read together and they pasted it on the

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,610
front desk war or something like that

00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:39,220
because that's a number we want to be

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:43,709
able to refer to right so please if

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,709
somebody has anything to add please do

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,119
[Applause]

00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,690
really each other start a what meeting

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,230
something in Traverse City here in

00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,230
trouble

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:16,970
yet under the question so you have about

00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:20,600
the year each of the sign signatures in

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:23,629
the beginning doesn't matter which sake

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,149
I satisfied if I take the version you

00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:28,929
have in the keyring all right organism

00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:32,569
that is two years old and has lots of

00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:33,019
lots less signatures or the other way

00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:36,970
around

00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:40,669
I'm still behind of siding my Cape Town

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:47,529
designing set sewing everyone right can

00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:47,529
I sign the current piece suit I'm afraid

00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:56,379
okay I made this is graphic shop with

00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:59,660
the keys as they were uploaded to the

00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:02,389
public ability servers towards

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,279
realizable so if you've got more

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,860
signatures that would be reflected there

00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,350
if you didn't know they don't worry now

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:12,289
this this is a picture for this year's

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:16,549
TV if you call it a given I'm in this

00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:20,529
year's set of keys I'm mapping it to

00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:24,850
something that resembles cubic but a

00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:28,669
it's the same basically identification

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:31,700
for a person who who use changes enacted

00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:33,799
with last year or different male this is

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,600
is here they will have more signatures

00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:37,760
on it but you're signing that entity

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,870
you're not saying the whole of the file

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:45,500
just the identities of course if from

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,500
last year to this year I change my a my

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,960
here

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:54,740
my main team well I will be a different

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,740
person right of course

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,150
so again

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:26,590
okay what where is it what is the first

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,990
step or somebody who wants to prepare

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:32,049
for a future designing somebody who has

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,350
not yet used innovative well to learn

00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:39,610
how to use equal opportunity to create

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:42,270
private key to see how they will store

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:47,049
how they will protect their private key

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:53,190
how I mean to play with it that's the

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:53,190
