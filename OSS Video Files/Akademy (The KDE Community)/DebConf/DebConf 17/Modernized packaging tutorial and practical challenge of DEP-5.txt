hello hello my name is Osama okey I'll

00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,389
be talking about MA designing

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,949
modernizing packaging tutorial and

00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:20,830
practical challenges of DEP five and

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:24,160
beside documentation I do package input

00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,619
method and also if you install any Asian

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,980
language you're likely to have my glue

00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:36,579
code to put select all these input

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:40,449
method anyway maintenance guides which

00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:43,420
was started by Joseph at 1999 I was

00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:45,789
based on the helper too and that may be

00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,699
one year after they actually started and

00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:51,370
also tool of choice what dat make which

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:56,260
also started a year ago so it was very

00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:58,750
fresh and new and had a actual package

00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:02,079
as an example at that moment and that

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:05,280
was actually based on made file and he

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,020
hadn't some nice Latin words basically

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,579
go by example that's what he meant and

00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:15,250
but then I was a sending patch and I was

00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:17,860
invited to be a DD I say there I don't

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,960
need to then I got into the new maintain

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,530
us hue and stayed quite a bit and

00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,899
eventually became a DD but yeah and

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:29,770
that's how I started and that's how this

00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:31,810
document will started and but after

00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,320
couple years it was getting a little bit

00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:41,740
old so I start taking over the

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:45,780
maintenance of maintenance guide and so

00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,780
and they've helped I became two to four

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,950
what did I do

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,140
and of now they've helped us guys he

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,939
changed for four to seven and actually

00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,090
seven was one of the Epoque making one

00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:05,500
seventy eight eight nine and that's when

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:08,649
the D H syntax came in also what

00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,380
happened was a Debian doc HTML was

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:14,650
getting outdated and I had to maintain

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:18,340
it to keep it building but I actually

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,319
converted it and I'm asking policy to

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,150
to it and they're now finally moving to

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,160
this way so and PFOA that was used

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,410
wasn't used originally but it's

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,970
eventually used so it's now have a very

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:38,110
good collection of translation and also

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:41,200
with this 12 years I had to do quite a

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:45,849
bit of these ad hoc editions Multi arch

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,099
the package and symbols library package

00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,829
name convention in extremely short

00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:55,269
version because there was no document in

00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:57,549
within Debian policy so for newcomers to

00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:01,599
understand at least some short text and

00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:05,200
also some I helped by text for these key

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,440
tools which is widely used but I was

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:14,910
becoming in one word messy that's what

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:17,500
it was 12 years you can't blame it and I

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:21,549
realized there were quite of challenges

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:25,810
and to make a packaging tutorials one is

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:28,630
packaging tool itself had a kind of not

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,370
so well organized document and one of

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,920
the candidate was used scanned so I've

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,280
been working on use can recently and

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,849
made a reasonable make file with decent

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,620
for map and that released recently so

00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:47,560
that's pretty good and some packaging to

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,019
as I said it's like you scan you up you

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,450
you update was extendable even though I

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:56,650
don't like how much I had to write it

00:03:52,450 --> 00:04:01,599
and then the H make license check was

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,139
another to empower for that Odysseys I

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,849
think power

00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:08,560
well extending it was no intuitive and

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:13,180
was a little bit difficult for me so I

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,599
didn't extend it and then also packing

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,829
to requirement has been moving and you

00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:22,930
know through use of D H 7 or 9 or 10 and

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:26,039
most packages are either auto to see

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:29,440
make see these standard packaging the

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:31,360
absolute upstream build structure exist

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,039
and also there is a lot of get text

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,270
support

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:38,189
so that has to be covered and this isn't

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,619
too much about documentation but

00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:43,469
multiple Tabo was possible with

00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:47,159
typically three so you can need to be

00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:50,219
updated which wasn't a case and multiple

00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:54,270
binary packages there wasn't much

00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:57,240
support in th make to make multiple

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,210
binary packages out of one source and it

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,460
wasn't intuitive so and writing down all

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,529
these details in text especially in

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:09,419
English is even harder than writing

00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:17,270
powerful for me so it was a big stopping

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:21,379
point Longbottom what happened sorry

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,639
anyway then there was a sob story arch

00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:28,169
reproducible build all these new things

00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:30,289
came in so how do we move forward that's

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:33,569
how I faced the problem and then

00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:36,089
packaging tutorial need to was doing all

00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,939
the Hat ad hoc fixes but that's not good

00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:42,990
enough and we need a structural change

00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:46,110
and also root cause that tools need need

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:49,830
to be updated and so if there is a wall

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,080
we need to challenge it this wall was

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,289
challenged there are other walls which

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,990
need to be challenged okay so how do we

00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:03,930
do it one thing I did was updated use

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:06,809
you scan and basically wrote reasonable

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:11,550
thought document so now it's readable

00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:14,990
and added couple features and I wanted

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,969
to add more about this PGP key and

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,029
signature support and also git repo

00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:25,729
support because it is get getting very

00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:25,729
popular to parish there there and

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:37,030
and I think is a this.d H make this was

00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:40,240
kind of fixed three format output so I

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:43,180
need to be Molly Whitman was flexible

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,250
and that's how I decided to write this

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,910
did they make it was supposed to be very

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,650
simple this was my original scope and I

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,500
wanted to release for Jessi I was almost

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,540
done then I got a little greedy and

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,760
start writing the five copyright

00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,930
template generator because it wasn't

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,210
there and but there was some I thought I

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,100
fixed back and then I introduced back so

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:10,830
I decided not to release it for Jessi

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:15,460
and finally got released for this sketch

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:18,850
anyway that's how this new tool was

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,280
written it wasn't too much about I hate

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,770
how it was because I need to cover these

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,700
new features and that was the only way

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:32,130
to for me to write and okay let's talk

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:36,220
about the five it's very interesting

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:39,090
format and standard machine readable

00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:43,810
blah blah blah okay that sounds good

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:45,970
okay what's a benefit actually forget

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,270
about machine readable the biggest

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,550
advantage is human reviewer friendly

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,410
that was one of the best thing happened

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,690
so if you want to read it you don't need

00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:59,890
to look for all the files it's all there

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:02,380
or this it was supposed to rhyme the

00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:05,290
ambiguous format in a file name and all

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:08,260
of the linked and that was a actually

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:11,650
becoming a requirement to get a package

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:15,100
accepted so insure package they put a

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:21,250
lot of effort to make it and they did

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:24,190
and well reality the only machine

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,140
readable usage is maybe a licensing

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:30,040
competition which is already known so it

00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:33,150
wasn't much used at least to me I I may

00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,900
be wrong but that's my impression and

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:40,750
initial practical challenges of the five

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,940
implementation was no active enforcement

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,399
of consecutive applause

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,130
I don't want a name particular package

00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,410
but I have seen some package changing

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:54,310
license it's free license to free rising

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:56,800
so it's ok with Debian but the copyright

00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:00,550
file it was carrying the oval license so

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,529
that and it was accepted to the FTP so

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,690
that was happening

00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:10,449
so just because poetry even for

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:13,240
developers limited time it's too much

00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:17,470
work to do all these money house check

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:21,550
every applause and there's no automatic

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,829
check on the server-side or FTP master

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:27,940
side to check it and kick it out so of

00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:29,980
course and in the engine check wasn't

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:34,269
implement because there is no automatic

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:36,519
script to do it and then fight format

00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:40,870
limitation and this may sound a little

00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,480
bit corner case but MIT license type of

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:47,860
license has many text and mostly putting

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,079
some company in a minute so maybe I'm

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,959
wrong but I read it like you are

00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,709
supposed to copy exact copy text write

00:09:52,959 --> 00:10:00,009
text from sauce to the copyright file so

00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:01,899
then you need to copy many many files to

00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:06,310
me that it sounded so that was a

00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:08,980
limitation and also deaf ID doesn't

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,730
dictate or at least this was left to the

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,519
implementer and all the tool man fact

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:17,740
creators thing loose to store machine

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,689
generated template actually I didn't

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,459
think about it but somebody else thought

00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:24,670
about it and they are putting it in

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:28,449
that's a good idea and method to track

00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:31,029
previous human our decisions because you

00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:32,649
make automatic file but by the time you

00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:36,459
are supposed to put it in the Debian

00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:39,519
package human made a changes so since

00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:41,380
there is no machine gender file stored

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,829
so it's kind of difficult to identify

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:48,970
what was done and method to detect

00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:52,269
license check mismatch and since it's

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,510
it's not intuitive to compare human

00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:55,660
edited version to the machine generated

00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,050
then

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:04,030
so it's kind of linked problem but

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:07,990
that's what the problem and okay this is

00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:10,570
the example of the MIT license basically

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,520
if you look at xox travel package they

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:18,670
still have old-fashioned copyright file

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:22,960
and I think sixty some type of MIT type

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:26,230
of license listed there so a lot so if

00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,960
you do it in a modern way and following

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:33,760
the day five maybe you have to write MIT

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:38,710
license variant one variant to up to

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:43,630
maybe vary in 65 anyway and for them the

00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:47,470
program I have actually like Hammond ham

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:50,530
case you know test case in the package

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,990
to test build and I have 75 type of

00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:56,770
these MIT license different license in

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:59,380
it as a test case and there's hundred

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:02,380
eighty a license template file to be

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:05,500
tested anyway that's one challenge and

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:10,570
another challenge is odd tool files you

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:13,660
know it's kind of stupid but there's a

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,540
lot of in GPL permissive license Auto

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:22,150
tools exception that cetera in make file

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:25,300
and make filing and etc so but I see no

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:29,500
man no one in food ass manual hand

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:32,290
picked the file file made that exact cut

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,810
out of those copyright or whatever

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,690
statement there and I once said there

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,760
why do we have to put this and maybe we

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,150
should read access policy and that kind

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,040
of thing

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,330
oh you're not supposed to do it then

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:49,180
okay I don't argue so I just decided I

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:52,720
keep kept the tool to be able to produce

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:56,290
it by having extra if you want go ahead

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,610
give yourself but I'm gonna make my

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:03,160
default a little bit more reasonable

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:05,800
that's how I did and after two-year

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,390
delay people kind of caught up and the

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,450
license check seemed to be getting

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,450
better as I checked recently

00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,610
this talk and people are using it I have

00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:18,560
to admit that so that must be pretty

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:20,940
good to be used and I also saw CD BS

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,560
basically this seemed to call this one I

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:28,500
may be wrong but then was using it okay

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:32,210
so if he use it maybe has a good reason

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:37,200
to do it but there are other tools to

00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:39,900
make their five tools and that's this

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,600
one actually uses maybe simplified all

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:47,040
right and step type of text in it and

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:51,810
that's my tool has a copyright file

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,820
generator and also verifier in it this

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,000
is another Python implementation at

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,220
least Python deviance seems to be a

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
little more professional writing style

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:08,760
than mine and then I see Ruby so okay

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,590
anyway what's the difference

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:18,060
license check maybe do the scans sauce

00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:21,330
do some minimal editing removing some

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:25,110
baby leading style or something and then

00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:27,690
they do partial text match and then

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:32,100
wherever it's matched they cut it out

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:34,290
and they seem to make the file output I

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,460
don't know how exactly it depends on how

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,560
you two used to they may be creating

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:43,260
extracted text or they may be just

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,510
labeling as a MIT license anyway one

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:50,040
other thing I found out I see DBS I

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:53,340
think one I follow gdv or something was

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,240
using automatic generated file stored in

00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,690
under stabian directory that's a good

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,870
idea

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:04,620
I should imitate it or just steal the

00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:09,900
idea and but this definitely you know

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:13,830
due to this way of cutting out at least

00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:18,390
they're not making so much need nitpick

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:23,600
type of the decisions on the license

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,600
text and it's pretty decent for

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:32,690
anyway that was pretty decent for a DPL

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:39,210
tube type of a just a simple assignment

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:43,800
licenses and then what Dimmick does is

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:46,830
actually I scan text and usually just

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:51,390
assume that top portion has a license

00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:57,810
text just cut out entire section there

00:15:51,390 --> 00:16:01,290
and remove maybe simply copy right hold

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:05,250
the name and then rest I assume that a

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:08,850
license and I kind of of course in many

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:13,020
of them uses boilerplate so it's same so

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:16,080
then I bunch them up they I do full text

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:19,530
much for the license and starting with

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,680
very rigid one to relaxed one so we know

00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:26,310
what level of much is it does and then I

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:30,570
write make a default put us may be too

00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:34,710
picky but as you know with this method I

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:38,790
decide I could do the day five generated

00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,180
file against a sauce check okay so far

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,940
so good

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:46,740
and at least some people you seem to be

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:48,720
using and but now that I see other

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,320
people did seem to have a different idea

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,960
so maybe I may modify all just maybe

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,510
stick the license check into the dev

00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,210
make two and dropped up my current code

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:04,110
but if I ever change my code maybe I

00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:08,340
should do some maybe limiting the ranges

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:12,630
of file to be scan or at least way to do

00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:15,000
it and also dream the license takes

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,940
match and sometimes they have a total

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,070
and it created English Wars after that

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:25,410
so maybe trim it beyond what's matched

00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:29,130
then do this day five generation that

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:33,030
may make a little cleaner is out so

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:35,640
that's so much for their five and maybe

00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,480
that's from next release I'll be looking

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,350
at

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,350
and at first packaging tutorials you

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:46,910
know basic ideas maybe not time limited

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:55,200
so I basically made they make based

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:58,370
tutorial and the key here is this I have

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,049
source actually customized for this

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:04,049
tutorial and also I have all these

00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:07,620
variations documented that tutorial so

00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:10,950
you can have a exact example and also

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:14,520
this source package can be unpacked to

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:17,820
create a log of packaging so that people

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,100
can try and experiment with a simple

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,760
source other than some existing huge

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:26,460
Debian real package and I think these

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,919
are relatively simple and if you have

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,530
any suggestion to add I'm thinking maybe

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:37,260
make it making font package or something

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:40,950
as addition and that's what I'm thinking

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:44,700
and of course it has to be dh10 and some

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:47,040
of the words I need to correct it to be

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,320
neutral etcetera etcetera

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:53,900
so that's what I'm looking at so I'll be

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:56,910
glad to get any feedback or suggestions

00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,830
that's pretty much my talk thank you

00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:06,210
very much for listening

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:06,210
