	00:00:04,649 --> 00:00:10,090
okay so hello so the talk is called

00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:13,660
today actually ask me anything about

00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:17,279
Debian or for french-speaking persons

00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:20,499
demo disk every service field Jana I

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,199
didn't prepare anything special I just

00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:25,839
thought it would be a good idea if we

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,779
have some time where people just can ask

00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,570
some random stuff of course I'm not -

00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:34,590
ultimate Debian guru maybe some people

00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:39,250
know better is a specific question about

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,890
Debian people can know about that so

00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,949
just to introduce myself my name is

00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:49,239
emmanuel Kasper I've been a Debian user

00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:52,899
since 10 years and now I'm a Debian

00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:55,750
developer since once one year maybe if

00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,760
you seen the talk from Helen before you

00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:02,140
see they have different statues of

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,470
Debian developers so I'm not myself too

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:08,439
windy beyond packaging I'm doing ready

00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:11,140
to be installed image with the Debian

00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,320
cloud teams so we're a bunch of people

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,329
who are making ready to use

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,570
Debian image for different crowd

00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:24,460
providers like Amazon Microsoft Azul and

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,240
OpenStack and myself I'm working to make

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:31,540
Debian ready image for vagrant which is

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,840
a DevOps tool this is what I'm doing in

00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:38,049
the beyond and so I'm not doing at the

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,570
moment any packaging but I hope I can

00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:44,500
start to do this again in the near

00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:48,850
future as soon as I have more time so

00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:52,689
just a question here because the aim of

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:55,619
the open day is for new person in Debian

00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:58,270
who have not using the beyond yet so

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:06,070
who's here is using the IANA

00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:10,750
on at least one of its computer ok most

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:13,269
of these people actually everybody here

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,220
speak English I don't need to switch to

00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,879
France but if you want to have something

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,709
in French

00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:22,670
I can answer in

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:29,150
so now what would you like to know about

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:30,920
deben up to you packaging technical how

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,560
do you know what

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,409
why should I switch to D biana instead

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:48,079
to another distributions I think we have

00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:50,139
a question there we will give you a

00:02:48,079 --> 00:03:00,379
microphone so everybody can hear you

00:02:50,139 --> 00:03:02,180
including myself so I didn't get time

00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,310
clear to play with Debian 9 so it might

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,799
be a simple question for some of you but

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,930
I know that ifconfig for interfaces is

00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,719
not a thing anymore do you know why and

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,790
what is the replacement for it which

00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:17,389
package which I have config to see your

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:22,010
interfaces so I've configured has been

00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:23,449
replaced with the IP tools actually I

00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,790
don't know the reason of that I just

00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:29,449
know that it's a part of general

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:32,209
transits we're moving from EF config and

00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:35,569
that starts to this new tool which is

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,819
now I don't think EF config was called

00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:40,879
when the package called net tools and

00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:42,769
it's not installed by default so but

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,569
it's still available but it's I don't

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,359
think it's installed by default anymore

00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:50,120
so for if for each package from net

00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,859
tools you have a replacements in the IP

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,069
tool package so for instance your

00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:57,229
ifconfig it's EP for instance for a net

00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,500
status if if you want to list your so

00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:06,790
kind of opens you can replace that with

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:09,310
SS and for root you can use IP route I

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,310
think each package more or less have a

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,310
replacement

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,570
I truly rerun into that problem because

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,380
some when doing cloud image some package

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,540
we're dependent on if configuring we had

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:55,610
to we had to install the package because

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:58,700
it was not installed by default so as

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,340
Helen said before Debian is software

00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,650
basically a software collections which

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,320
is made by extra people you have the

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,300
guys doing the Linux kernels you have to

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,440
the guys doing the desktop interface

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:15,080
norm you have the guys doing the network

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,890
stack like this EF tools and basically

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,530
we take from Debian 8 from Debian 9 you

00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:24,260
will have from all of these things a new

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,390
version so it's difficult to know

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,090
package for package which is exactly

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:32,690
suffering is going to be inside a new

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,970
version of Debian but one thing which is

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:39,620
nice is that for every package you had

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:41,720
installed in Debian 8 for 95% of them

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,540
you will get the new version so you

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,760
always get be up-to-date to the new

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:51,560
versions so for instance when you start

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:54,410
a Mac or Windows laptop each program

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,020
starts the same sat at the same time to

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,240
its own installer and you have this full

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,700
of pop up oh I've got a new version of

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,230
Java have a new version of OpenOffice I

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,180
have a new version of Flash please

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,340
install mean still means tell me in the

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,580
VN everything is centralized and when

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:13,520
you make this Debian 8 to Debian 9 or

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,520
package getting updates at the same

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,800
times which is also interesting under

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,510
desktop but even more on the server

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,240
because you are sure that nobody is a no

00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,030
server package is left unattended for

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,010
instance a lot of problem in sick

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,350
these happen for instance people

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:35,440
installed a new version of WordPress

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:38,200
that they download from wordpress.org or

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,600
its finds I have the latest versions but

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,420
after six months one years two years

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,430
three years five years nobody updates

00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,540
this package and this is where you have

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:52,480
security problem if you install the word

00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:56,710
WordPress Debian package first you sure

00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:59,950
that you have security updates which I'd

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,990
backported and it will be always taken

00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,330
care of in the next day beyond an

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,950
upgrade so everybody goes and everybody

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,570
becomes an upgrade so you don't have

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,550
some legacy software installs that

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,370
nobody forgets I think it's very

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,950
important me as a seaside Mina I always

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,200
try whenever I can to install Debian

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,630
package because I'm sure I will have an

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:24,210
upgrade path and it's not some package

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,210
which is left unattended on the server

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,110
does that answer your question

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:46,199
okay so everybody is knowing anything

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:48,449
everything about deviant it's a good

00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:53,099
question I would says and so like any

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:58,620
good rappers easy to publish a package

00:07:53,099 --> 00:08:01,199
to Debian yes I'll know it depends from

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,499
the technical side is basically you have

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:09,629
to know en you make because the Debian

00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:12,300
rules which builds a make sides made

00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:15,000
files is a make file by itself so you

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,580
have a lot of tools which goes on that

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,409
but basically is a set of make file so

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:25,080
you have it helps if you know then you

00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:27,689
make so it's not for package for

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,150
instance which software which has

00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:32,459
already released like classical again

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:36,300
you software where you do configure make

00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:38,550
make install it's very easy because a

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,719
lot of tooling have been done in the

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:45,899
last 20 years about this for instance if

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,750
you want to do some packaging like no GS

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:51,060
or Java it's more complicated because

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,000
you have you have a lot of small

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,860
libraries and you we want to do a

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,250
package for all of this

00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,320
although actually it it depends you want

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,240
to make a deviant package for yourself

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:16,019
or to make a demand package that you

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:18,600
want to upload in debian so as i it's a

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,260
it's to publish freely in toda beyond

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,399
servers

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:27,449
mm-hm so it's depend on how is the

00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:30,570
upstream software don't if it sees otto

00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:32,820
conf kind of software is very easy now

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,130
owns you have the packaging don't so

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,230
second step is you have to find

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:41,180
somewhere inside debian which is

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:44,250
interested interested by your package so

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:47,770
there is a website which is called

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:50,710
mentors where people propose a package

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,720
until they began developer say okay this

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,540
looks interesting the packaging is nice

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,390
I want to have this into Debian or not

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:02,790
for instance my own experience like

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:05,650
three years ago I made a package of

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:10,840
program which is called VM touch which

00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:13,960
is a program to manipulate page cache of

00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:17,050
the of the system I uploaded in two

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:21,340
Mentors nobody was interested package is

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:24,030
not any to Debian but the original bug

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:27,430
it was still in the bug tracking system

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:29,910
now I've seen that six months ago one

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:33,040
Debian developer started to talk with

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:37,570
absolute master of VM touch to make this

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:40,210
into the beyond again it's the guy I did

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,760
not have any time anymore and now one

00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,500
week ago and also Debian developer said

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,570
to me oh I saw I'm sorry we did not

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,660
applaud your vm touch but I want to have

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,700
this in the beyond so please propose it

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,970
again to Spencer and I will put into the

00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,580
archive go so you know it's test

00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,860
everybody everybody's life what you can

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,200
say is Debian developers are most of the

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:07,380
time very busy and doing a lot of stuff

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:09,910
so a brand new package depends of how

00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,950
interesting is of software will get or

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,540
will not get into the bends why because

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,950
some people say during the time of

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:20,230
healing healing it's sometimes better to

00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,210
start inside part of the team but of

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,710
course it's better to learn to learn

00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:27,960
from scratch you want to do your own

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:31,540
package to see how everything works and

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,840
when the package gets accepted how do

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,810
you update how do you push updates into

00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:41,080
the Debian servers

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,540
when you are not Debian developer for

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:47,350
instance I was before so DPN maintainer

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:50,200
I had a we had a command get in first

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,690
hook to where I have access on a Debian

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,420
server which is called a lot so I was

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,340
making my packaging here on when the

00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,620
packaging was finished when after new

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,960
extreme release so I have data to change

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,600
load some minor stuff

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,660
pushing files around then I said to my

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,030
mentor which one had was the guy who had

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,930
the right to put the package inside the

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,370
gun what was the name of his cage I

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,440
forget I asked

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,520
I've wrote an email hey I have a new

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,800
package release

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,350
can you please that upload okay I had a

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,190
look and then upload and then after some

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:30,760
kind some I say one year he said where

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:33,220
you good enough I have to front to do

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,170
the work all the time so now I'm

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,810
granting you the status of the DN

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:40,570
maintain earth where you can put where

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:50,290
you can upload yourself by yourself

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:54,760
suits package directly one in your

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:58,960
opinion do you consider that there are

00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:05,670
some areas or teams in the Debian

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:12,130
project need more participants or

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:18,280
currently need more activity to to make

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:21,100
Debian I don't know bigger or to group

00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:24,100
some some stuff that is not very well

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:27,160
developed but in your opinion which

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,830
areas do you conceal that need this well

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,350
from what I know I know the some call

00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:36,660
code teams that people taking care of

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:40,230
each server of the gilepsy are

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:42,850
understaffed but it's a very technical

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,640
topic what they are doing so

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:49,120
I mean you for this you really need to

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,840
have studied Computer Sciences to help

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,970
or to be very strong but it's not a must

00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,540
for instance if with one guy who

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,550
published a lot of real-time patch for

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,220
the Linux kernel which was from

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,590
profession and statistic while working

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,010
in a hospital putting anesthesia and he

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,690
wrote a lot of kernel code but I think I

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,980
know for instance for these these teams

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,980
are bitter understaffed

00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:32,780
everybody happy yes

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:36,870
can you talk about long-term support

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:40,140
yeah so long-term support in is an

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:43,650
initiative which was start to provide a

00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:49,220
security upgrade a security update sorry

00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:53,190
for Debian package besides the normal

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:56,190
lifetime of a Debian release so normally

00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:58,170
a Debian release comes it's released

00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:01,260
when is ready so you cannot say how long

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:04,650
when will the next one comment but there

00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:07,680
is basically security updates for Debian

00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:11,250
stable release for the whole lifetime of

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,150
the release plus one year so at the end

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:17,340
it you goes around three or four years

00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:21,240
depending when comes and actually so

00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:24,420
what this means is stable security

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,330
update is that so debian maintain us

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,880
take care to add to each package you

00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,910
have installed take care to have only

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,950
the small security fix which has added

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,890
to the package and download it to your

00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,870
computer workstation so you don't get a

00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:45,270
new version of the package so for

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:48,780
instance Linux is now at version 412 or

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:51,300
whatever but DB on GC had version added

00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,610
beyondstretch had version 410

00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,640
probably but if there is for instance

00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:00,240
the bug which is a discovered debian

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,920
kernel it will only be fixed by basel ii

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,420
nuke in the linux kernel for the latest

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,180
release so they bein the Debian

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,980
developer takes is more fixed and put it

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,140
back in the stable versions that you

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,460
have so for instance the idea is that

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:18,030
each time you do a Pitta get update you

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:21,570
get a bug free security free version of

00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:23,310
Apache of OpenOffice without getting a

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,010
new version where you have to update all

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:30,030
your configuration files so security

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:34,740
updates now Enterprise Linux

00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:36,720
distributions like hi dad like so called

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,170
on top rise Linux distribution because

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,019
Debian is also

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:45,220
surprise Linux distribution my company

00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:45,610
have very long support cycles like seven

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,940
years

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,540
we're in seven year for seven years you

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,860
will have always this security update

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,250
without having to install new version

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:59,260
for software and for very big

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:01,870
organizations you need to have this very

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:06,220
long sake cycle because when you have

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:09,010
thousands of servers even making a major

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:12,130
upgrade every three or four year is too

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:15,400
much so the thing is during this

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:18,939
security work is a very tedious work and

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,829
people don't like to desist always for

00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:24,699
free on safest time so there is a

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:28,299
sponsor initiative by Geico - Hertzog

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:32,919
that a couple of developers pull

00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:36,460
themself pull resources so we can so we

00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:39,429
can have a longer security update for

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:42,669
Debian stable release I think the aim is

00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:45,790
to make five years at least but I don't

00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:48,640
have the exact so exact numbers but is

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:51,820
the idea is instead of having a stable

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,890
system with security of date for between

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,309
three or five years three or four years

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:59,940
you have that for a longer cycle I'm not

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:03,190
using myself but I think it works

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,559
because they just do the same process

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:09,090
that we do for Debian stable they do it

00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,090
they do it for all the release

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:05,840
effective muscle so the question was

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:08,510
that it looks like Linux is always used

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,690
in small groups and not Main Street

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,470

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:17,810

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:22,669
I've heard about some guy that puts a

00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:27,200
backdoor in the chromium browser package

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:30,769
is that true you mean after the GC

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,080
released or like three years ago I

00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:35,450
didn't hear about this I'm very

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:39,490
skeptical you means the chromium package

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:42,230
the chromium source code which was

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,909
assumed developer Oh inside the Debian

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,889
package which is made from the code from

00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:48,889
Google inside the Debian package

00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:52,370
directly I know I don't know it's that's

00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:55,880
true minitor because I've heard that on

00:22:52,370 --> 00:23:02,210
Twitter and some made yes I don't know

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:04,490
does anybody knows about this that's a

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:12,769
nice check your sources check your

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:15,470
sources I mean I don't I don't believe

00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:18,169
it for a second because I know I know

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:21,740
they have some they had they have been

00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:27,289
some big security problems in the Indian

00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:29,090
for instance one happens that the the

00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:32,539
laptop of a developer wire was

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:34,039
compromised and we knew because some

00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:36,500
stuff which were compromised were

00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:40,549
uploaded to the servers and we found it

00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:45,889
and we fix it and so we don't have the

00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:48,440
we don't hide things so I don't know I

00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:53,330
don't believe it because just show me

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:57,880
your source afterwards also I want to

00:23:53,330 --> 00:24:02,330
add these they reproduce evil builds

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:05,299
doing a great job precisely to avoid

00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:09,940
that kind of backdoors

00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:18,529
in the code to to copy exactly the code

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:21,440
as original sources so have you heard

00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:24,460
about Debian initiative called reproduce

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,869
reproduce able built

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:31,480
nope the idea is that that you can

00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:34,600
download the code which is used to make

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,889
the Debian package you rebuild it again

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,809
and the binary identical bit per bit to

00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:43,149
the one which is on the Debian archive

00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:45,970
so you can be sure that nothing was

00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:50,289
tempered in between this is an ongoing

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:51,399
effort now 80% of the Debian package are

00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,320
reproducible

00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:56,110
so it means basically you have to take

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,119
care of you don't have a inside your

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:01,799
package or change log for instance with

00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:04,779
a timestamp of the build so I haven't

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:07,419
mind self use it again because as I

00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:10,210
haven't found yet as an end user the

00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:12,429
documentation oh I want to check that I

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,999
can reproduce this package from the

00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:19,090
source code exactly how I can i download

00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:21,159
it but I know it's now 80% of the

00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,490
package are covered there will be some

00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:26,740
talks about reproducible bill during the

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,879
count because it's a topic where a lot

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,879
of people are working at the moment

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:44,980
there's someone else have another

00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:47,230
question it could be having polemic if

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:59,230
you want you can start a polemic a we

00:25:47,230 --> 00:26:02,049
haven't talked about system D etre hi

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:07,660
can you give us some information about

00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:09,760
your work on image for cloud about the

00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:13,799
work I make for the cloud from the cloud

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:17,110
do you prepare our image for Amazon from

00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:19,059
so I'm inside the team which is making

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,120
an image for Amazon's

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:29,549
which which is called very originally

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:32,650
Debian cloud so so we try to agree about

00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:35,740
common tools and common what should be

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:41,010
inside Debian image which is uploaded on

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:45,040
the cloud for Amazon the idea is that

00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:47,200
actually a lot up to now a lot of Debian

00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,299
system were installed with the Debian

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,210
installer when you cook your CD next

00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:54,820
next take and then but now a lot more of

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:57,429
dbn system are just you log to the

00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:01,900
website of some cloud providers they

00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:03,580
start decent and for the biggest it is

00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:08,110
actually from some very big cloud

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:10,990
providers like a zoo on Amazon they want

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:13,000
to have the Debian stamp that it's

00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:16,990
official it comes officially for for

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,390
Debian it's good for us also because

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,880
we're shoes are not putting some package

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,040
for instance which are non free or don't

00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:29,410
respect our policy oh we disagree

00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:31,690
technically currently we try to there is

00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:34,419
an ongoing work to switch everybody

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,880
started within own way to build image me

00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:41,410
I'm using some software which is called

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:45,760
packer some guys used bootstrap visit

00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:47,789
some guys used vmd bootstrap now in the

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,269
future we want to use

00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:54,239
a software which is called F I disk

00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:57,090
image the also of F our high disk image

00:27:54,239 --> 00:28:00,450
is also dip cone tip conf and will make

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:06,840
an introduction so it's just like you

00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:10,379
run against you run your manifest with

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,539
FA a disk image program you get ro disk

00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:15,149
image you sign this as a Debian

00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:17,869
developer and you upload that to the

00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:20,429
cloud provider so me I'm uploading -

00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:23,970
it's not exactly a cloud provider

00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:26,399
because the image are online but you run

00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:29,070
them on your own computer which is

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,909
called vagrant so on App vagrant up

00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:39,090
common so people have some things they

00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:44,299
can trust then you use backgrounds and

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:47,729
for Tokyo I'll call them official image

00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:51,830
fro is a good questions there are two DB

00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:56,129
on developers who are doing docker

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:59,220
images but I don't think they're in the

00:28:56,129 --> 00:29:02,609
process of making them officials but if

00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,769
you go for instance - as far as I

00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:07,379
remember

00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:10,710
inside the car itself the two guys who

00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:12,929
are committing to the build

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,269
infrastructure which is creating the

00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:18,269
Debian docker image are two Debian

00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:21,690
developers but we haven't been a lot of

00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:23,369
contact with them so you should trust

00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,799
them it would be better it would be if

00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:28,049
it would be an official cloud image

00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:31,499
build on the Debian infrastructure but

00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:33,659
we're not we're not there yet

00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:35,789
for instance simply because the whole

00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:39,210
Debian infrastructure is made that you

00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:42,690
can build packages non-root so for

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,279
instance you don't have to be root on a

00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:47,070
Debian server to build a debian package

00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:49,320
before the cloud is cloud image you have

00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,239
to be rude because you to create device

00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,429
notes and stuff like this and the debian

00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:57,109
infrastructure is not yet ready at the

00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:57,109
moment for this kind of work zone

00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,189
that was the cloud image

soo-ji michigan colleague proxmox i give

00:32:55,059 --> 00:33:07,059
a shot here her canton position

00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:14,970
documentation ipv6 was made I'm working

00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:19,090
at proxmox here I'm working at Debian

00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:21,070
for a Debian based virtualization

00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:23,620
solution which is called proxmox quad

00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:26,980
but most of my Libyan work I do it

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:29,529
outside proxmox I would say 90% I do it

00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:36,669
my own time and 10 percents in my

00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:40,029
proxmox time what is the biggest problem

00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:42,669
that you consider actually in the Debian

00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:45,690
project in the technical or in the

00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:50,620
social way your opinion what could be

00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:52,630
the biggest problem for you nowadays the

00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:56,760
ban developers don't have enough time to

00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,760
do all the stuffs they would like to do

00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:08,610
okay so I think we are reaching now

00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,710
slowly the end for those people here who

00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,470
don't have done yet on their own

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:16,320
computer I will be also this afternoon

00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:19,320
we will have an install fest which means

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,940
we have a lot of USB sticks I have some

00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:26,550
USB sticks here and on each selfish USB

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:29,550
stick is a Debian installer and we will

00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:31,770
help you put Debian on put on your

00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,150
laptop and configure all the software

00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:37,230
you're Ike

00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:40,080
so it started I think four o'clock no

00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,900
half past half past two the Debian

00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,580
instances so for people who haven't who

00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:53,800
don't have yet Divya knows a computer

00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:54,850
come last questions okay thank you
