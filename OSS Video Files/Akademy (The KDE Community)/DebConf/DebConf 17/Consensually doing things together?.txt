	00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,430
good

00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,660
[Applause]

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,290
[Music]

00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:23,229
so was there yes who has seen it on

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:31,719
streaming yeah who doesn't know anything

00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:37,649
about it constantly doing things

00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:42,069
together something me the sticker and

00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:45,520
because I talked about essentially doing

00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:48,310
things together by making parallels

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,439
between different communities that are

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:54,700
all about doing things essentially

00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:57,939
together such as the anaphase community

00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,099
the poly anime community and the mother

00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:02,789
community that should body not be

00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,789
nominated

00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:18,720
so and Valhalla made stickers very nice

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:18,720
and that inference suited many of them

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:36,790
actually it's only these ones over here

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:39,989
but yes my laptop and and all of this

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,670
reminds me of what we ought to be doing

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:47,739
what we have chance to do if we play our

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,360
cards right but it also seems to me if a

00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,380
lot of these stickers go around I'm

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,030
afraid it's a false sense of security

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,830
having signals doesn't mean we are

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:03,660
actually doing things together

00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:06,310
essentially and because it's it's

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:11,530
talking about personality in the

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:13,959
increase of the projects is unusual talk

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:17,890
about relationships talk about

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,420
relationship advice because it's the

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,769
same thing

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:28,209
danyoung is a relationship between

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:30,010
multiple people and so I want to talk

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,430
about relationship consensual

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,610
relationship in short relationship

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:39,480
because non-professional

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:43,050
relationships ensure abuse I want to

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:48,320
talk about relationships not studies and

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,320
I don't want to have abuses that you

00:03:48,800 --> 00:04:01,550
consent what is consent we assess that

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,560
[Music]

00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:17,130
[Music]

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:23,000
consent means the agreement to engage in

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:25,740
things in activities sexual or otherwise

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,140
without the use of exploitation of

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,680
transformed power of authority coercion

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:43,130
of facts consent can also be removed at

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:43,130
any moment so they bellowing saying that

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,860
one should know exactly what and how

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,230
much one is agreed to express their

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,460
intended purpose state and side three

00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:16,440
did not permit to participate so that in

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:20,610
wise how many of you decided three will

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,590
motivate me to participate in area how

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,610
many of you expressed the intention

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:38,580
participate how many of you knew exactly

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:45,180
what an hour right if you see my point

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:48,390
lessening of the topics so consent

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:54,390
requires awareness like in a

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:59,070
relationship it's not like can we do

00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:01,350
this okay you said yes that stuff

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:07,100
doesn't work like that in that year it's

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:07,100
the same would you like realistic VMAX

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,090
like okay what is this about

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:22,780
a lien on your old life of the museum

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:29,560
house will belong to us and amen

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:32,380
there needs to be a awareness and to be

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,970
in a position of being able to give

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:40,240
consent so say I'm in a relationship and

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:41,440
I say oh I decided I want to I want to

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,800
do laundry anymore

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,080
and if I say it when the other partner

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,270
is tired or busy doing things they may

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:56,800
say oh if I say it when the other

00:06:52,270 --> 00:07:02,250
partner has a chance to say why tell me

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,250
more and then take part in a negotiation

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,030
situations are very different so consent

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,640
requires me there and be in a position

00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:21,150
to expressions knowing one has other

00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,150
options

00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:39,960
because nobody's written many guides our

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:43,199
consent on many articles our consent on

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,900
free software but Amalia are we yes then

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:54,509
we can seal them the people in the Mia

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:56,280
and where we put them the Italian both

00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:00,000
personal boundaries are damaging to the

00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,860
self that will expand on this later but

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,500
you need to know what's good and what's

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,289
not good for yourself before having

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,439
people before saying yes when people ask

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:15,240
you to do things you cannot consent if

00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:17,759
you do not have a choice previous

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,370
concepts never authorize withdrawal of

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,270
consent you can always say no even if

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,270
you had said yes

00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,570
right

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:41,279
Berlin so that was the chat about

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:43,829
nonsense it's not just say if getting

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:58,519
consent from someone is not just forcing

00:08:43,829 --> 00:09:02,069
them say yes because now relationships

00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:09,930
denim is the universal operating system

00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:11,730
and data is maintained maintained by the

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,730
long-term health of Marion is a

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,920
consequence of the long-term health of

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:21,060
the relationship between their

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,829
contributors then it doesn't need to be

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,380
technically perfect it needs to be

00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:27,029
socially healthy if there's a technical

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,579
problem in dunya but there may be

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:31,079
socially healthy then there is a

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:34,290
community of people that can fix the

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:37,019
technical problem if there any socially

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,540
unhealthy no matter how good is the

00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:42,259
operating system it won't fix the

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,259
society

00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:09,549
not that was in the previous talk that

00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:12,549
the one again now that when you go and

00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:18,160
see it in in the video that measure that

00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:26,459
it covers the many bucks but this is the

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:30,549
fourth Indian so so healthy community

00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:33,189
this is called Thomas Tillman conflict

00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:39,939
mode instruments and another that means

00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:46,470
that I like to have I will at some point

00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:51,309
folks the notes they were happenings yes

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:54,730
the are in vertical access this focus on

00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:58,869
the relationship or cooperation the more

00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,549
one is to the right the mobile moves to

00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:02,709
the right the move where is cooperation

00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:05,619
the mobile moves to the left the less

00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:08,350
there is cooperation on the vertical

00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:12,160
side there's focus on agenda or

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:15,850
assertiveness the more I down in the

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,029
graph the more I do not care for my own

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:21,730
needs or what I want or for my goals the

00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:26,079
moving on up in the graph the more II

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:29,589
care for what I want so at the bottom

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,779
left where there is little focus on

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:35,730
cooperation and little focus on my own

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:38,649
goal that is avoidant I don't care man

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:44,790
we know from a situation maintain

00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:49,269
neutrality whatever and moving up

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:51,160
towards no cooperation but I want my own

00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,950
goals there is competition

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,450
I mean you

00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:59,910
vo some gay I don't care about you all I

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:02,180
want this to happen it will happen no

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:06,570
matter what

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:09,000
instead Dow so no focus on personal

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,580
growth but focus on relationship that is

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,940
accommodation you win I lose

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:18,180
concede to the other party as long as

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,250
harmony is maintained yet have it your

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,830
way want to have a fight with you I

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:29,760
won't have what I need one do what I

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:33,360
want but at least you still love me in

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,870
the middle so sub focus on cooperation

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,860
and some focus on personal goals that is

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,430
compromised

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,130
I will sum I lose some its me totally

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:47,310
acceptable to all it doesn't manage the

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:50,900
relationship but it's kind of feels like

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:53,970
a failure for everyone and much

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,760
attention to goals and maximum attention

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:59,640
on the relationship that is

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,620
collaboration I mean you win when we

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,260
work together to expand the range of

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,260
possible options to achieve win-win

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,740
outcomes so and the moment it seems

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:13,470
where the conflict and none of us can

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,680
have all we want instead of fighting

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,480
over it we can properly over it to try

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,950
and find out if there are other ways

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:26,880
that we haven't thought individually

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:28,530
about but together we may find of having

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:36,180
something that really works for all of

00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:39,840
us and this I think because we are a

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:44,940
technical project and technical outcomes

00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:50,940
are easy to measure it boosts it doesn't

00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:55,440
accomplish it insults thirty-two

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:58,440
yes that's a big focus of goats they're

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,620
 ports when somebody's goals are

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:05,009
not achieved basically so that's focus

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:07,850
on goals is very easy to see and we need

00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:10,980
to deliver on time a release and so on

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:15,089
so I think we've had a lot of focus on

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:18,240
that but what's more important I think

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:21,029
for the long-term health of the project

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,870
and for their good happiness of people

00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:27,509
the project is focusing more on the

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,120
relationship and if we if we don't

00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:32,639
really achieve all our roads but the

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,870
relationship is good it means if we

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,870
haven't achieved our goal this year

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,800
we'll achieve it next year if we are the

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,689
focus of goals

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,000
it means if we don't achieve our goal

00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:45,149
this year we'll never achieve it

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,279
because there won't be a next year with

00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:49,279
a community to work on it

00:14:52,930 --> 00:15:03,189
so I'm like all the motivation in this

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,319
relationship between a lot of people

00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:11,050
every one of us has motivations how many

00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:17,170
of you those things is that then because

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:23,050
you want to our making you do things is

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:28,720
leaven because you have to write how

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:37,420
many of you do both okay so this equals

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:39,819
you have to means that something right I

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:43,449
think I should do now that's there

00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:56,160
anything I should is a word which means

00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:59,319
I don't want to but actually it's quite

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:04,269
interesting in relationship to realize

00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:06,490
when somebody says should take care that

00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:15,249
actually means I don't want to but

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:17,829
because yeah there's more such

00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:23,769
interesting words in relationship I can

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:25,950
mention later like we we is a very good

00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:29,149
word

00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,149
[Music]

00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:36,310
we means I the one thing is possibility

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:39,750
from what I'm saying so I'm pulling you

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,750
into it whether you want it or not

00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:55,660
so yeah whatever value motivations to be

00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:58,380
DeLeon some may be healthy something

00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:01,810
they are healthy healthy innovations

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:04,030
sustain the relationship unhealthy

00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:08,400
motivations to be in a relationship may

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:11,290
explode spectacularly at some point

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,660
movies are full of unhealthy motivations

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,980
to be in a relationship movies with only

00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,089
healthy motivations to be in a

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:22,839
relationship are boring

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:26,100
but you know like Italy is wonderful for

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:30,550
tourism but not very going to live in it

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:34,270
same equate with relationships better be

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:49,600
boring and healthy than exciting and

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:56,200
unhealthy created a wonderful wonderful

00:17:49,600 --> 00:18:01,300
world for a kind of task in them in

00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:05,170
which is a Galadriel economic is a task

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:07,680
that you have to do otherwise soundex of

00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,680
the middle

00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:17,409
and which is summarized by this slide

00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:37,100
and by the way although looks

00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:47,259
consensually into it maximum and some of

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:47,259
that I think as well and we think of it

00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,580
myself

00:18:55,399 --> 00:19:01,999
what motivates me to start a project of

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:05,989
Tijuana India I have idea for something

00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:10,429
far obvious or I said something is broke

00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:12,980
and I have many other fixes it one makes

00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:18,759
a parallel with relationships that

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:22,460
second parts may not work as well but

00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:25,369
back to them what motivates me to keep

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,830
maintaining a project Oh nobody else can

00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:30,470
do it nobody else can be trusted to do

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:33,499
it nobody else who can and can be

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,980
trusted to do it is doing it or

00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:39,769
somebody's paying me to do it so I since

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,970
I have a problem motivating myself to

00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:45,470
keep making faces

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:48,700
what yeah obviously having different

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,700
yeah and that was me

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,049
so he said somebody else may be doing

00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,999
differently he thought upset somebody

00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:23,119
else may be doing it wrong differently

00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:26,299
wrong that's other example motivations

00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:29,659
it takes me a little time it's useful

00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:33,619
for me it's fun it saves me time to keep

00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:35,929
something running to make a continuous

00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:37,879
effort to keep something running then if

00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:43,219
I don't care about it one day it breaks

00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:46,879
in my face another example of motivation

00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:50,149
it makes me feel useful is it healthy is

00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:52,729
it not healthy it depends on people a

00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:54,649
little bit scared by doing something

00:20:52,729 --> 00:21:02,080
because I feel useful because the day I

00:20:54,649 --> 00:21:02,080
stop and come useless so I can't stop

00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:18,580
getting positive feedback it's so

00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,580
awareness of why I am doing something

00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:26,479
helps me in consensually decide whether

00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:28,399
I want to keep doing it if I don't know

00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:33,919
why I am doing something that I keep

00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:36,889
doing it by habit and 20 years into a

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,219
bowling relationship I wonder where my

00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:39,219
life

00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:59,580
that was motivation don't work has

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,430
motivational speaker yeah no I mean

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:06,840
these are examples of bad good

00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:16,730
populations examples of good populations

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:16,730
raise hands Steve because it's fun yes

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,230
[Music]

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:45,380
yeah because it makes it work the place

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:49,970
I rather like to live it yes because it

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,970
it helps in the music yes

00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:13,590
I can achieve the result that is

00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:20,940
aesthetically appealing yeah I like

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:26,130
working with these people okay

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:36,770
it keeps me safe youth audience should

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:44,280
work as a motivational thank you yeah

00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:49,050
motivation that I'll agree was I really

00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:54,780
like what you said and next step next

00:23:49,050 --> 00:24:02,700
topic energy energy is that thing which

00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:06,630
is measured in stools the consist of

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:09,540
spoons comes from people suffering with

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:11,550
chronic health issues and it's a

00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,460
metaphor saying that you wake up with a

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:16,650
certain amount of spoons and doing

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,810
things will cost you spoons that you

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,820
lose along the way and when you're out

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:25,800
of spoons you are done you can't do

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:30,320
anything anymore and so someone with

00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,320
chronic health may require effort

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:42,059
others but and this mental focused item

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:47,370
is used in general to talk about energy

00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:49,720
one feels for doing things so this is

00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:53,590
the example washing hair making

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:57,460
breakfast we don't really dance every

00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:04,330
tasks that may be hard for people with

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:07,410
chronic illness but we also have cross

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,410
[Music]

00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,730
so my sleep

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,190
significant

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:15,950
I'm a dragon that lives here but every

00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:18,349
activity kind of has cost in energy so

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,899
say hello team passes one spoon at a

00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:22,940
complex which is two schools because I

00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:26,019
need to forget what I'm doing and get

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:29,659
into the whole context of something else

00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:31,219
there's a new corner case maybe a lot of

00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:33,580
schools because something I've never

00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:46,729
felt before

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:51,169
engage may be a well-written baguette

00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:53,899
ball can give me food because which the

00:26:51,169 --> 00:27:01,159
negative spoons may not exist in the

00:26:53,899 --> 00:27:03,919
world where this came from that could be

00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,929
something that motivates me there's an

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,239
interesting fact I like to read them and

00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:17,119
gets the excited about something let's

00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:19,639
play news software and somebody doesn't

00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:30,830
tell me whether they use it or not but

00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:36,129
they uses the wrong interesting be like

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:39,710
if I have five movie tasks in the same

00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:42,830
context it magnified spoons or less

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:46,479
maybe that's an economy of scale if I

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:54,519
have five multi tasks in five different

00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:59,119
parts that may cost me five plus eight

00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:03,429
be schools because I have two spoons of

00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,429
context which in between it stops

00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:30,760
I want sadistic us the work we do with

00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:30,760
Daniel costs energy and we say we

00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:56,810
so working them in costs and what is one

00:28:54,410 --> 00:29:01,040
person capable of doing

00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:04,010
I think that as a project we expect a

00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:08,510
person to do the things that one person

00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:23,600
can actually do is there any reduce

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:26,540
manager interval right and because we

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,790
are there in and there's a lot of exited

00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:33,070
people in the year we have a history of

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:36,110
people who managed to do anyway stuff

00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:42,610
that we wouldn't expect a person to

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:47,260
really be able to do like applying

00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:47,260
beautifully to also post amenities

00:29:48,490 --> 00:30:07,750
managing complexity and I'm thankful to

00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:11,720
people who managed to do that but I

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:15,080
would like to show compassion to them

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,440
but not glorify them not take them as a

00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,330
model of what everybody should do

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:25,660
I'd like that in to be based not on

00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:29,630
heroes but unreasonable expectations

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:34,970
both the expectations of others and on

00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:36,050
oneself if you are out of school you

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,500
don't need to

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:42,290
going if you need spoon for something

00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:46,490
else that is in Debian we use them for

00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:49,190
something else if you are out of spoons

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:52,550
for something important and nobody else

00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:58,730
can do it it is not your problem it is a

00:30:52,550 --> 00:31:00,860
problem in the community from the

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:03,860
outside point of view if someone is out

00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:06,200
of spoons they are out of spoons they

00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:09,110
don't get more spoons of you exist

00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,950
if you system only take even more spoons

00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:14,570
away from them if somebody needs their

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:18,290
spoons for something else they are

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:20,120
entitled to them if someone gets out of

00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,800
spoons for something important and

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,280
nobody else can do it it's not their

00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,740
fault

00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,480
it's a shared responsibility it was a

00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,960
problem that would put someone in a

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:36,290
position where he favored new things

00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:39,830
sauron takes over middle-earth Damian is

00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:41,750
a shared responsibility don't expect few

00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:45,320
people to take care of everything and

00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:47,930
leaves for ends when our person that

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,910
takes care of other things leave space

00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:54,050
for more people to take responsibility

00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:57,620
for things turnovers and powers because

00:31:54,050 --> 00:32:05,060
I know I I can do something without

00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:07,360
getting stuck into it because I can move

00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,520
on something else

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,780
humans are a renewable resource but only

00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,780
you think of them that way

00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:23,450
also when committed what takes more

00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:29,500
energy tends not to get done so if we

00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:29,500
offer all the work on very tight

00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:36,770
well if I overwork and I run a very

00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:41,660
tight energy hundreds then routine tasks

00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:43,640
I can manage not only tasks get stuck in

00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,250
my mailbox waiting for name with more

00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,220
free time or energy for spoons which

00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:52,130
would party never happen because even

00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,290
looking at that inbox will require a

00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,380
decreasing amount of food because I know

00:32:54,290 --> 00:33:04,130
I have a vague idea of a nightmare that

00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:07,370
isn't that so if I run a tight energy

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:11,900
budget am I able to listen when 3d cases

00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:14,030
happen I am able to respond am i able to

00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,940
listen and respond when socially pretty

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:20,200
cases that may be even more demanding

00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:24,110
because it's not just a strange bug that

00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:28,580
I produce and about fixes but there's

00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:35,090
some thickness of the situation that I

00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:40,550
don't know how to deal with and on a

00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:44,810
vitamin C budget am i able to be seen on

00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:48,980
respond when harassment happens

00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:51,560
am i able to tell people raising valid

00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:58,460
issues from troublemakers those are all

00:33:51,560 --> 00:34:02,120
difficult things in the new mental

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,250
process on a privacy budget it's easier

00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,030
to accept a new maintainer than to

00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:09,830
reject them

00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:13,880
so when other words there's no filtering

00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:15,980
or that is less filtering it becomes

00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,580
impossible to make a call on a

00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,580
controversial

00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,179
[Music]

00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:58,380
suppose my personal goal is to not spend

00:34:53,850 --> 00:35:10,500
any for energy today therefore avoid

00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:13,290
this competition also there could be a

00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:18,050
task that requires so many so much

00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:18,050
energy today and it goes

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:33,620
so you're strong beautiful swimming into

00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:46,260
tasks that we are used to be workable

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:55,400
still human achievement like release

00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:59,100
done DPL the more these tasks become

00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:02,580
inhuman be achievable the more we

00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:07,620
require heroes to take care of them and

00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:09,140
not just any person and although we have

00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:14,100
several heroes in them

00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:16,950
it was away that other place they burn

00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:21,000
out they can become martyrs

00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:22,080
the can become villains and in general

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,960
they tend to be our

00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:30,770
waiting to happen because yep no choice

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,770
then having a deal

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,619
so

00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,140
I

00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:45,529
I would encourage and we want to be

00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:48,499
aware of a much energy you're spending

00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:51,289
on things how much energy you are

00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:54,709
requiring from other people and if

00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:57,559
there's somebody feed like some person

00:36:54,709 --> 00:37:03,979
is doing an inhuman job consider

00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:07,549
checking our situation and if they need

00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:09,859
help and if there could be a different

00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:14,539
way to organize that part of the meal so

00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:19,599
that it goes from a superhuman task to a

00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:19,599
mere human tasks that humans can do

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:31,690
another thing of energy balance is the

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:35,240
dictatorship of who has more spoons

00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:37,910
someone press a lot of energy can take

00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:43,190
more and more tasks out of people who

00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:45,859
have less energy sounds nice but after a

00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:51,410
while he slowly drives everyone else

00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:53,210
away because like oh I don't want to

00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:57,800
wait for me you have a lever on do it

00:37:53,210 --> 00:38:02,450
and so on and you can see slowly you

00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:07,310
have one person and focus moved from

00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:12,290
cooperation towards goals then that

00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:14,119
person ends up being a hero and you have

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:17,530
another person who's too big to fail and

00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,530
another accident waiting to happen

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:26,780
and that's another potential issue with

00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:31,880
sometimes over enthusiastic people that

00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:34,930
come with a lot of energy and if the

00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,410
situation is now managed recently in

00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,410
destroying a team

00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:59,280
a similar thing may happen in

00:38:48,720 --> 00:39:04,010
relationships I can't today after why

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,010
listen that's cool

00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:20,060
and energy within of perfectionism

00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:20,060
another thing that in the end we don't

00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:29,540
[Laughter]

00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:39,180
correction we do me good enough so yeah

00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,570
just perfect

00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:48,120
all the friends look up to you you give

00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:51,090
people relationship advice you'll say

00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,340
knowing that you're moving it right then

00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:56,310
one day you have an argument with your

00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:58,200
partner in public and at that point you

00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,570
don't just have to deal with the

00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:07,770
argument but also with your reputation

00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:11,430
and yourself exception shattering so one

00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:15,050
thing I hate about them is a consistent

00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:18,210
track record of technical excellence I

00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:22,020
don't want to be required to always be

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:26,100
right and one of my favorite moments in

00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:34,140
the history of Lebanon is the sshd

00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:36,630
generation because it's an example of

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,120
how that doesn't need to be technically

00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:43,970
perfect it needs to be socially healthy

00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:46,700
and technical problems can be fixed so

00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:50,859
there was this big issue

00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:53,359
it was a mistake done in good faith the

00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:55,190
person who was maintaining as I said at

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,680
the moment is still maintaining a stage

00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:00,890
now and he's still very highly valuable

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:04,880
but everyone and very highly valued by

00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:12,170
everyone and the Fogelson bad was not on

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:14,240
lane it's a state that so the focus of

00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:18,740
the project was how to correct the

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:21,619
mistake to the old ways key migration

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:24,020
how to change the workflow of that year

00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:29,930
so that that kind of mistake will be

00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:35,480
harder to do in the future so I would

00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:41,329
like to make mistakes and focus more on

00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:43,760
having a focus on cooperation so that

00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,740
even though we're not achieve our goals

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,740
we can work around that

00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:52,480
we can achieve that next time we are a

00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,480
community that is still able to achieve

00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:01,609
indefinite amount of growth and also if

00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,880
we discover we've been wrong all the

00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:04,430
time

00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,109
something important it's not the end of

00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:11,780
the year it's the beginning of an

00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:15,400
improved it's cool it's great if I find

00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,400
out that all items of

00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:32,540
then about motivations perfectionism and

00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,790
the pre-exam some banks we get people

00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:39,109
that are too good to be true

00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:41,150
and the Cubs point in most people they

00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:44,210
experience when one learns that when

00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,510
some things they do the people that

00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:49,130
might indeed be too good to beat them

00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:56,750
for example there are people who cannot

00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:59,630
say no they have fear of criticism fear

00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:03,140
of making mistakes whatever you ask them

00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:08,510
they say yes I'll do it I'll do my best

00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:14,270
yes like to go out of the concept yeah

00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:16,490
sure you think everything is great you

00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,859
live together with them for years

00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,760
it's common in suffering all the time

00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:23,480
and you never have it

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:27,260
we've been abusive for years in good

00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:30,380
faith and you didn't know all there are

00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:36,580
people who cannot take a normal people

00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:39,500
who have a problem with a sense of worth

00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:42,230
like by default they would like to have

00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,450
a sense of worth and they depend on a

00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:47,710
constant supply of achievement and

00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:49,970
admiration to feel a sense of world

00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:52,730
therefore they have a lot of spoons to

00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:55,460
invest into getting this constant supply

00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:58,250
of achievement and admiration and it'll

00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:00,170
be really nice convenient Amin makes

00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:03,200
them happy makes the project happy

00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:05,810
except what there is something they do

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,390
is challenged 1 points are the mistake

00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:11,150
they made or 1 point of the problem with

00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:14,869
their behavior and all hell breaks loose

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:18,290
because they see not just what they've

00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:21,140
done challenged but they're full sets of

00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:27,370
their whole being gets caught into the

00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:29,780
challenge and the reaction is a

00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:38,150
spectacular out most of that are

00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:41,480
outburst of this activate so it's not a

00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:45,170
problem to have people like that in

00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:51,620
Tibet we probably have many but it's

00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:53,030
good to be aware it's good too and also

00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,980
it's good to make an effort to keep

00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:58,850
interactive course actively with the

00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:01,040
rest of the community and to be aware of

00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:05,030
these factors to compensate for one's

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:08,860
own tendencies I might know that I have

00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:12,710
a problem saying no and it's not

00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:14,420
constructive to ignore it when dealing

00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:17,720
with them in because they tend to over

00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:28,220
commit and people think that I'm doing a

00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:32,660
lot of things and that I can't go or if

00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:34,850
what I need is this by achievement and

00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:41,150
admiration I will race the world's the

00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:44,150
competition side of the chart and tend

00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:47,170
to destroy the cooperation the demining

00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,170
and so on

00:45:49,390 --> 00:46:00,670
more awareness exercise to things from

00:45:55,749 --> 00:46:11,559
relationships appliance and any of you

00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:15,880
have no red flags arrest police when

00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:18,339
something smells like something happened

00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:34,959
that is not a big deal but it could be

00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:38,380
the tip of an iceberg so bu the bank the

00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:41,920
maintainer closes it without applying

00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:44,799
without saying anything right now why

00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,289
did you close the bag until just stop

00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:48,660
bothering me at flag maybe they're

00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:52,299
having a bad day

00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:55,690
maybe that's no a person that should be

00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:57,880
and six-packs I don't know say for

00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:00,089
future reference if it's happening

00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:06,369
if I keep collecting red flags then

00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:09,729
maybe we are that's a green flag is the

00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:14,349
opposite it's a tip of potentially an

00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:18,690
iceberg oh nice say I have an argument

00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:22,479
with someone at the end of the argument

00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:25,390
we are more friends than before and we

00:47:22,479 --> 00:47:28,810
agreed on a solution that works so

00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:40,270
it was great Cleveland that's like a

00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:45,210
person that is nice to interact and if

00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:45,210
you have examples of green flag

00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:05,869
did you raise a hat

00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,869
you can shout it out the Beatles

00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:42,819
so somebody was sending a bad day and

00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:44,650
you got about that life right when you

00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:45,910
think of someone else's age for reason

00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:48,869
that you not understand

00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:48,869
yeah

00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:06,220
breathe like when you get a quick

00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:10,109
coherent response to something you're

00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,109
asked about yes

00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:17,660
they're coming

00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:24,950
when you get it quickly so I'm saying I

00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,950
can't deal with this now yes

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,970
quick response a that can deal with this

00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:34,170
now a green flag in a relationship

00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:41,160
somebody says no green flag you know

00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:48,600
they can say them somebody says no to

00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:56,040
help me and I may be this fabulous no

00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:58,880
but they'll call someone and then

00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,880
apologies

00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:09,890
there's a nice article a better way to

00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:12,509
say sorry I've actually seen it in

00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:15,690
several different way the night this is

00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:20,789
the original article or something but

00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:25,200
it's the what I have which makes the

00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:27,150
point that apologizing is not about make

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,400
the person who apologized feel better

00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:35,339
because they wash the thing from their

00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:37,920
conscience but about fixing the problem

00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:39,420
or making an effort to understand fix

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:46,079
the problem make sure it doesn't happen

00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:48,299
in the future so that's them that's

00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:53,059
nobody in software and you could see the

00:50:48,299 --> 00:50:57,450
back report and you don't say oh sorry

00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:59,489
and close the file you make an effort to

00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:02,220
the computer system the sanding make the

00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:06,420
fix upload new version and then it was

00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:10,999
the power right it's socially it could

00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:16,710
be exact same so there's this guide to

00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:19,440
apologizing properly which is number one

00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:22,829
I am sorry for and then repeat what

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:27,059
happened that caused the problem

00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:32,849
so trying to reproduce the path and this

00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:37,339
is all because and I understand that

00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:41,670
that what happened cause they think so

00:51:37,339 --> 00:51:52,579
produced by and find out where in the

00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:54,709
software I try to change your behaviour

00:51:52,579 --> 00:52:00,619
that doesn't happen or thanks to

00:51:54,709 --> 00:52:03,259
software so we enterprise

00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:04,939
oh oh sorry and number four will you

00:52:03,259 --> 00:52:11,410
forgive me

00:52:04,939 --> 00:52:15,640
make sure that your efforts are not just

00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:18,170
to make himself happy but also to

00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,969
address the problem the other person

00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:23,839
make sure you are also making the other

00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:26,929
person okay after that you caused

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:32,959
so will you forgive me is the sixth

00:52:26,929 --> 00:52:35,719
bathroom identical we get it right

00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:38,029
technically this is the parallel

00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:43,719
socially we can allow it so vividly and

00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:46,699
then any issue that happens is potential

00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:49,880
instead of a niche that happens itself

00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:53,410
be a cause for embarrassment becomes a

00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,410
cause for growth

00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:06,310
don't be afraid to fail or above the

00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:13,560
ball and then he was saying green flag

00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:13,560
I got back from Islam was it better I

00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:20,530
think that anything that comes with any

00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:24,100
kind of Galadriel thing if you don't do

00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:28,090
it I'll take over middle-earth should

00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:31,300
not fall on anybody's shoulders should

00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:35,140
be share no matter what in the shell or

00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:37,720
god I will prefer in them yet if this

00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:41,470
kind of if you don't do it nobody will

00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:44,050
tasks would more be more likely to be

00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:50,619
met with okay then I won't do it and

00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:52,900
nobody will that side will be down until

00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:56,830
somebody can take care of it sorry I can

00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:59,860
do it rather than okay sucks to be me

00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:04,800
I'll take a week holiday and try to fix

00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:12,450
it because the second is not sustainable

00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:12,450
it looks sustainable but we have

00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:30,799
and the responsibility for a healthy

00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,799
relationship is shared

00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:41,339
maybe it's my first relationship and

00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:46,740
together with some people's dating

00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:48,960
people for ages and and I'm like oh I

00:54:46,740 --> 00:55:00,480
don't know anything about this dating

00:54:48,960 --> 00:55:02,760
stuff I expected more experience both

00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,770
maybe I have stuff to learn from the

00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:10,500
other person but they still need to take

00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:13,200
responsibility for what I do and there

00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:16,980
is possibility for a healthy community

00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:20,010
is a shared responsibility is not only

00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:25,369
the responsibility off and Department da

00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:29,599
and the leaf substituent media anyone is

00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:29,599
entitled and encouraged to

00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:51,700
on the right side of the gospel

00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:54,640
combination and and also we have project

00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:58,720
which active people counted by the

00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:04,750
thousand official members or non-members

00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:11,730
and it's unlikely that harassment isn't

00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:14,730
happening and andy hoffman sees band

00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,730
because

00:56:18,250 --> 00:57:40,830
we don't have to deal with what happened

00:57:47,810 --> 00:58:06,440
and then finally do not invalidate if

00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:08,830
something times something into him time

00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,830
too

00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:12,949
[Music]

00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:20,750
acknowledge that except that somebody is

00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:23,360
doing something and that it's okay that

00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:33,440
they lose then you can be feedback what

00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:35,900
they're doing balance try to make not

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,030
block not stand in the way of what

00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:41,020
people are doing unless what they're

00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:44,560
doing is actually hurting you then

00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:50,180
collaboration inside may help better

00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:52,550
it's okay that if you don't like the

00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:56,060
general thing that they're doing you

00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:58,300
don't need to validate everyone but at

00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,300
least

00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:09,630
I personally don't care if people that

00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:15,380
we hang with when I do something I

00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:24,180
perceived it a bit like good boy I

00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:32,610
rather prefer if people say oh that's

00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:36,900
useful like show an interest or what

00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:39,270
they need to deploy this acknowledge

00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:42,360
that I'm not something I don't care if

00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:50,220
it's particularly liked but give me the

00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:55,520
freedom to keep doing it rather than

00:59:50,220 --> 01:00:02,310
feeling my ego feed my freedom feed my

00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:07,550
possibility to create that don't give me

01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:07,550
a reward give me space dignity

01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:19,620
yeah

01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:23,430
Teter thought that came up in

01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:28,110
competition recently with the person and

01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:35,880
I thought was very interesting and it

01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:42,000
also made me face less energy not to

01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:43,770
stand in some of this way maybe more but

01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,550
I like a project of people who are

01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:54,110
thinking and then a project where every

01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:54,110
time somebody moves yes

01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,819
questions

01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,449
[Applause]

01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:35,610
so I found this really valuable and I I

01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:37,680
I'm not trying to say good if we're

01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:40,500
doing this but whatever I what I am

01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:44,400
trying to say is that I personally would

01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:46,470
find this is an interesting Avenue to

01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:50,070
continue exploring and refining and

01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:51,630
better understanding and I can hopefully

01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:54,630
try and corner you at some point over

01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:57,390
the week to pursue some of that um but

01:01:54,630 --> 01:02:00,990
this is neat I love that our community

01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:04,500
does this and I hope that the thoughts

01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:05,820
from this work continue to move forward

01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,120
because I think that they might be

01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,120
better

01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:28,450
I tried to organize my thoughts was then

01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:33,420
as somebody that is running out of

01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:38,380
spoons lately and I believe you've been

01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:40,180
constant payments of pressure and I try

01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:43,570
to use my little spoons in the things

01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:45,880
that made me dinner

01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:47,380
that there are some thirsty some of the

01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:50,230
groups I take about some of the security

01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:54,610
group trying to collaborate when I have

01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:56,080
time that they look like perfect example

01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:59,470
we have something quite a performance

01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:01,480
we have one person from the security

01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:04,720
group every week taking care of the

01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:07,200
incoming emails and try to classes and

01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,030
quickly which I understand that it just

01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:16,000
needs to be done but nobody were set up

01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:19,990
I mean they look like the kind of

01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:24,280
right mr. kind of thing I'm betting on

01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:28,530
that that there's but maybe I boring

01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:49,810
we don't overnight so her so do them

01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:53,160
right I think as long as somebody keeps

01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:57,130
doing it even if they don't want to that

01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:58,420
nobody will find a way of doing it but

01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,330
that early there is a way with son

01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:04,090
having this file when I every week we we

01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:06,040
have this name somebody we have this

01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:32,290
rotation of names and somebody takes

01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:40,359
care that's it's a way that everyone

01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:42,160
does it again it's like when we do

01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:44,740
somebody else we have today somebody

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:49,960
else we have to spend those yes so the

01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:52,690
whole thing's big and it needs to be

01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:56,040
known that this is not sustainable

01:04:52,690 --> 01:05:01,200
it is okay if one week

01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:05,340
in opinion and something will fall to

01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:08,310
the ground there will be delays April's

01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:13,490
a sucks more if we are abusing people

01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:19,520
interviewing and when something breaks

01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:19,520
there's a chance to start a discussion

01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:24,000
ideally this discussion should start

01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:27,240
earlier so I look like with the scope to

01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,940
raise awareness to the fact that nothing

01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:33,000
is spoken but we're abusing people this

01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:53,520
is enough of a motivation to start a

01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:55,380
serious discussion with what you said to

01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:59,970
be enough to start a serious discussion

01:05:55,380 --> 01:06:02,010
to say that part is it's working out the

01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:10,560
back stop work at any time it's not

01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:13,940
sustainable it is a change and if the

01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:17,900
discussion starts maybe that could be

01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:17,900
somebody coming up with an idea

01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:27,220
Weston my aussie for you

01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:29,920
being asked what if I can accommodate or

01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:39,220
bigger than content easily but lots of

01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:42,430
diseases competition so I think okay

01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:44,290
then I think there's two people that

01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:45,119
have seen the situation in a different

01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:54,730
way

01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:57,849
and I hope and at that point there is no

01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:59,650
cooperation even though it seems like

01:06:57,849 --> 01:07:02,230
that on one side but the other side is

01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:05,980
not feeding it like that so it makes

01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:08,790
sense that the first step is to try

01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,790
understand

01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:32,490
take steps apologies is not that I've

01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:44,330
seen in this case but they this oh my

01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:44,330
god my book my active listening is

01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:52,830
trying to understand how the other

01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:57,530
person is why the other person is not

01:07:52,830 --> 01:08:00,450
exceeding his best cooperation try to

01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:04,170
explain to the other person like leave

01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:05,850
over the world in my own words what I

01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:09,870
understood from the other person makes

01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:13,020
sure that I understood what happens and

01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:15,960
the other person can do the same to

01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:18,510
reach a point in which we both agree

01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:21,690
what is the situation and that point it

01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:23,670
may be clear why it is that we are

01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:26,310
having two different things that whether

01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:30,170
they are really cooperating or competing

01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:30,170
or something in between

01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:39,820
so um disagreeing a little bit about the

01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:44,740
some of the situations where like the

01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:46,270
weekly rotations and stuff oh I myself

01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:48,400
at least stopped in a framework that

01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:52,540
focuses on trying to remove judgment and

01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:55,840
sugar for my life so I try not to do

01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:57,970
things cuz I should but instead trying

01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,590
to figure out why it is that I really

01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:01,150
and why I'm going to do those things and

01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:05,140
get to the point right I wanted to do

01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:09,550
them but there are a lot of things that

01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:11,470
I don't directly want to do the I won't

01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:13,840
used to say I should do but basically

01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:17,710
I've gotten to a point where I said that

01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:20,620
I do them because having considered the

01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:23,440
options that's the best way for me to

01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:25,630
move towards the world at one and I mean

01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,730
for example I didn't really particularly

01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:31,660
enjoy changing diapers I don't really

01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:36,850
enjoy taking out the trash but on the

01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:39,310
other hand I as part of doing things

01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:44,590
that I do enjoy like having healthy kids

01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:48,910
or living in a house this is repulsive I

01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:52,510
have found that those things need doing

01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:55,060
and by I'm taking the time to understand

01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:58,540
why they need it and how that creates

01:09:55,060 --> 01:10:02,560
the world I find that the motivation to

01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:03,280
do tasks that in a community in and of

01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,680
themselves

01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:07,810
wouldn't you know would I would hate it

01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:14,080
if all I got to do was take out the

01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:16,290
trash but I am I'm not doing it because

01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:18,820
I should have been doing it because

01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:24,130
having considered things I've gotten to

01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:26,680
a place where that's I understand what I

01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:31,570
choose to do to create the community I

01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:37,000
want to live it yeah

01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:42,400
I think what you say is important but

01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:47,019
not everything I may want to do with a

01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:55,869
play space needs to be pleasant and but

01:10:47,019 --> 01:10:58,840
I hope you don't feel abused see you

01:10:55,869 --> 01:11:01,840
having a need to change diet let's pick

01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:08,099
up with that I think the turning point

01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:12,940
is when when that doesn't need like an

01:11:08,099 --> 01:11:16,719
anime chore that enables something but

01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:21,519
feels like some of something I need to

01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:28,300
sign up for something that is positively

01:11:21,519 --> 01:11:32,190
making my world wars and then that's I

01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:35,380
think mine somewhere between these two

01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:39,280
and that line can only be the wrong I

01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:45,760
believe by the purchase was leaving the

01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:54,010
situation and from the outside I can

01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:56,619
only trust them because I'm not I can't

01:11:54,010 --> 01:12:00,179
judge better than them what's their

01:11:56,619 --> 01:12:00,179
energy expenses or things

01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:17,370
oh those of you who were first-time and

01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:19,320
blinded by things like a shovel so thank

01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:21,750
you very much for highlighting people

01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:26,490
need to check their own motivation from

01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:28,310
time to time my own experience for many

01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:30,840
many years of being involved is

01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:33,420
motivation is come and go it's all too

01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:35,640
easy however to start something because

01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:40,170
you're interested and stuck with it you

01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:42,720
know your relevant time enormous numbers

01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:44,880
but you have to be able to do the tasks

01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:47,430
that you think you need to do will come

01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:51,530
and go and it's important always to

01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:55,230
consider what you're committed to and

01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:56,820
yeah consider dropping things move on go

01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:59,300
and find something else you may come

01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:01,890
back again or don't feel you have to

01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:04,050
consisting something just because that's

01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:05,280
you've been always been doing it it's

01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:14,460
really really poor

01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:17,850
thank you for thank you for all of us I

01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:21,240
would like to add what I think might be

01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:22,530
missing it seems like most of the

01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,869
suggest

01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:27,650
individual than individuals choice and

01:13:24,869 --> 01:13:30,480
also individuals choices to help

01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:33,570
individuals who may feel that they've

01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:35,730
been abused or pushed too far but I

01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:38,130
think it would be good to insert into

01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:41,219
these conversations the topic of not

01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:44,010
just bad shoulds unreasonable rules but

01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:46,829
common understandings about how or

01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:49,770
should be distributed or might best be

01:13:46,829 --> 01:13:51,960
distributed so that some of those tasks

01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:54,150
that are so implicitly that seem people

01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,190
seem to do to their own detriment might

01:13:54,150 --> 01:14:00,090
actually be appreciated as more crucial

01:13:56,190 --> 01:14:02,340
than more believed because there was an

01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:06,139
unreasonably cheap supply of labor that

01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:06,139
has been heard

01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:16,900
I wanted to thank you again I wanted to

01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:22,450
bounce back on what was said or your

01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:23,850
attorney others though I guess it's not

01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:26,560
reasonable expectations regarding

01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:29,560
personally security working and front

01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:32,020
desk I I think there's a broader

01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:33,820
cultural problem we need to address as

01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:35,890
well regarding expectations break that

01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:37,630
photo up times make it work this isn't

01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:40,060
meant for a long time where were the

01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:41,890
uncommon for what machines would fall

01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:44,140
down and I believe there are certain

01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:48,190
tasks that cannot be accomplished

01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:49,660
without abuse basically like if you

01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:54,760
expect people to wake up in the middle

01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:57,850
of the night to attend machines I doubt

01:14:54,760 --> 01:15:05,580
that people really want to do that work

01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:09,730
at all so to fix that problem we may

01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:11,470
drop certain things altogether and we

01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:13,090
need to collectively make the decision

01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:16,250
it's us something that we can just work

01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:19,640
around and we need collectively make

01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:22,430
be very hard to do in some extent

01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:24,940
because it's a cultural social problem

01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:28,220
you need to solve and the question I

01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:31,490
unrelated question I had is I feel that

01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:35,450
the people that should hear what you're

01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:38,780
saying may not be here right now and

01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:41,240
then I've got this feeling tonight that

01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:45,140
in our community there is this group of

01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:47,450
people that have that knowledge that

01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:49,850
respect each other and there is a gap

01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:52,160
between that group and the people did or

01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:54,290
at least I feel they need sometimes

01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:56,890
intervene with people that I do not know

01:15:54,290 --> 01:16:00,530
how to approach them at all because

01:15:56,890 --> 01:16:02,570
there is this gap that even even I will

01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:04,850
if every parts of the lumina actually

01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:08,570
listened to me and I don't know where to

01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:10,040
begin with like how to if somebody is

01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:11,510
submitted somebody is an actively

01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,910
listening to you there's no way to make

01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:50,690
them actively listen I don't know where

01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:53,450
to go I know me and just really quickly

01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:55,340
tie together the parts of plastic cards

01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:59,340
it would be awesome

01:16:55,340 --> 01:17:02,399
and have better awareness of some of

01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:05,610
these tasks that are happening happening

01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:08,519
in groups that nobody wants to do I mean

01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:10,739
I know the security team does a lot of

01:17:08,519 --> 01:17:13,559
work but I didn't realize that you all

01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:16,409
were doing a rotation to we're having

01:17:13,559 --> 01:17:19,530
the problems not that I had free time to

01:17:16,409 --> 01:17:21,630
step in but but these are the sorts of

01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:24,360
things that would be nice to them and I

01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:25,979
know that yes there's been one person

01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:29,159
who's been dealing with the spam for

01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:31,590
forever and that's a slowly thankless

01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:33,840
job and it's only recently that it's

01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:35,639
starting to become obvious that it's

01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,399
just too much for a single person to

01:17:35,639 --> 01:17:41,669
deal with and there's lots of jobs like

01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:43,139
this that they're sort of helpful for

01:17:41,669 --> 01:17:46,919
the community but we don't communicate

01:17:43,139 --> 01:17:48,510
that that they're going on it Mike I

01:17:46,919 --> 01:17:51,929
don't know how to solve this problem

01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:54,840
with maybe just continuing to talk about

01:17:51,929 --> 01:17:58,289
these these jobs said we need done maybe

01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:24,300
this just you know hire our make people

01:17:58,289 --> 01:18:25,709
more aware right so maybe comments to

01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:29,789
the last few comments

01:18:25,709 --> 01:18:33,170
I remember reading somewhere it was

01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:35,090
somebody from Google or from Amazon and

01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:37,850
because the services and they were

01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:40,760
keeping services up more than promise so

01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:42,410
people started relying more on those

01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:46,580
services so they started actively

01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:48,830
restarting machines to basically to to

01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:52,900
to let people know that those are not

01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:57,550
production services those services so

01:18:52,900 --> 01:19:00,530
this discussion and mainly because

01:18:57,550 --> 01:19:02,330
people are now used okay that is always

01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:07,760
somebody through the security that is

01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:11,240
not or from male 19 that is taken care

01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:13,850
of spam so maybe if somebody if we start

01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:15,530
this discussion and if we have if we

01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:18,830
know that those people are over all that

01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:23,900
and we know it before everybody else out

01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:28,130
and say I want current I'm going to

01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:30,110
start selling selling ice cream on some

01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:36,950
beach instead of dealing with security

01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:53,930
issues it's better choice and took a

01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:56,840
week early before we have and declares

01:19:53,930 --> 01:20:01,230
them unavailable for the day no matter

01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:03,960
what to make sure that

01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:06,989
the social structure the the source

01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:10,260
organization can ask for backs in place

01:20:06,989 --> 01:20:13,970
and Netflix has scales monkey which is a

01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:16,739
process that kills production services

01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:19,400
to make sure that the infrastructure is

01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:19,400
able to cope

01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:26,700
I like those alias the know like

01:20:24,739 --> 01:20:30,480
institutionalizing that everybody is

01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:33,330
replaceable on the harmony solution

01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:37,739
point of view is to lower this the

01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:42,989
salaries but on a volunteer project it's

01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:49,200
actually good to empower and being able

01:20:42,989 --> 01:20:53,250
to take time off when needed just a very

01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:56,030
quick when I heard recently phone in

01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:59,760
showing where someone was talking about

01:20:56,030 --> 01:21:07,170
keeping relationships working and they

01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:10,800
said tasks to do for him to do in

01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:12,989
between mr. Tull system is ready and you

01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:16,350
can move things back and forth between

01:21:12,989 --> 01:21:18,619
is read lists and if you don't get the

01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:21,889
things being of the

01:21:18,619 --> 01:21:23,869
clean the toilet then it doesn't really

01:21:21,889 --> 01:21:25,580
and there we can see that it's not

01:21:23,869 --> 01:21:28,610
really a dream maybe we should have a

01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:29,989
list of without them anymore and then if

01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:32,630
someone else go is right cure them

01:21:29,989 --> 01:21:38,349
wondering that but it gets picked up we

01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:41,570
will go to work yeah

01:21:38,349 --> 01:21:43,369
I've seen people saying we were kind of

01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:47,800
fighting over who cleans the characters

01:21:43,369 --> 01:21:50,800
we've automatically vacuum cleaner or

01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,800
