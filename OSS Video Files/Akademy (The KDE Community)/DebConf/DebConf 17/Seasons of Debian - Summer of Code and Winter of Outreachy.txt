hello everyone are you able to hear me

00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:29,499
yeah so my name is Erica gula and I'm an

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:34,660
engineering student but pursuing my

00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:38,020
bachelor's and I I was a outreach around

00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,270
13 interned with Debian and if you might

00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,340
have looked at the schedule in the on

00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,710
the Debian website there was a co

00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,719
speaker with me but unfortunately he

00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,239
wasn't able to come so I would be

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,350
briefly covering up his part as well so

00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:55,660
let me so my journey being an open

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,730
source developer or more likely an open

00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,760
source contributor started with a

00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,829
different program called outreach II and

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,230
outreach II is an initiative which aims

00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,270
at uplifting the participation of

00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:12,040
underrepresented sections and technology

00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:14,500
and it has played a very significant

00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,350
role in doing that and the reason I

00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,500
think why it has been a being it has

00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,030
been so successful in uplifting the

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,759
participation of underrepresented

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,909
sections is that they made particularly

00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,220
the outreach e program particularly

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:34,390
targets women and other sections with

00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,960
Wow and it has really helped in me as a

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:42,729
person in getting started with

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,750
contributing to open source and so I

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:49,780
reached out to Debian through outreach e

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,360
an outreach e a program happens twice in

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,759
an EO and organizations which make open

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,340
source software they participate and

00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:02,680
they hire interns to work remotely for

00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:04,450
them for over three months so I decided

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,710
to work on our project which was

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,430
improving voice and video chat

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,580
communication it comes under free RTC

00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:15,670
project the reason why I chose to work

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,709
on this project because first the aim of

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,480
this project was very simple the

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:25,870
was to replace proprietary software

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:29,890
which software which are using being

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:32,349
used as free calling and for

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,120
communication and the second one was I

00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,969
the programming languages which are

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:41,739
being used in this project I was very

00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:43,599
comfortable in using those languages so

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,159
our treaty program has really helped me

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:51,040
to bridge the gap between coding and

00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:56,620
contributing I had three amazing mentors

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:59,019
Daniel Juliana and Bruno I think my

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,689
mentor they played a very pivotal roles

00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:03,730
right from the start and making me feel

00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:06,310
very comfortable working with open

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,669
source software and they exemplified how

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,829
comfortable it is to work and I still

00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:13,659
remember the when I was getting started

00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:16,389
with the program I had feelings of doubt

00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:18,609
whether I'll be able to give my best or

00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:22,389
not or whether I'm not technically good

00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:24,699
enough or not but and I still remember I

00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:27,669
kept refining the small email which I

00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:29,620
sent to my project mentor Daniel in the

00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:32,260
beginning introducing myself and the

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,819
project I would like to work on and I

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,560
think that was the most courageous thing

00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:38,229
I did to send her a simple email

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,069
introducing myself and after then he

00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:45,430
replied very promptly and he he

00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:47,009
exemplified how comforting how really

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:52,959
comfortable it has to work in

00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:55,810
open-source software so the particular

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,909
project I was working on was a was Leo

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,759
Michael so Leo Michael is an open-source

00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:03,340
software is an Android application which

00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,840
is used to make encrypted voice calls

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,290
and you can also send sip messages

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,689
across so the good thing about it is

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,389
that it has into an encryption there is

00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:16,060
no man-in-the-middle attack and the

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:20,530
dialer uses sip open standards like sip

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,909
and it and since it uses sip the

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,699
interconnectivity between other

00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:28,900
telephony systems is very easy and you

00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:31,360
can of you can connect to other

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:35,199
software's like Dead Sea or

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,210
communicator through yarmulke and the

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,460
registration process in Leo Michael is

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,830
very easy you just have to add your

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:46,569
enter your phone number and we'll be

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:50,849
able to create a sip address for you so

00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:53,680
I'll talk about and I'll talk about few

00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:57,909
contributions I did in the beginning of

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,860
my internship so I had to work on a

00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:01,990
white labeling concept I did not know

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,360
what white labeling was so then I

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,879
started to research on the topic so

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,860
white labeling is a product which one

00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:13,080
company owns or produces which other

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,729
company for chases or rents it and they

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,819
make it appear as if they have made it

00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:22,210
so this might sound very confusing but

00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,949
in and very contradicting that the other

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,629
company is taking away its product but

00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:32,860
in real life this is something which is

00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:34,629
agreed upon by both the parties so since

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,310
we Michael is an Android application I

00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:42,129
had to figure out how to implement white

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:44,080
labeling in Leo Michael so just like any

00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:46,150
application you have many versions of

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,089
the applications for example the release

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,889
version the debug version and the pro

00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:53,020
version or the free version so similarly

00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,759
I created a white label version so the

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,009
aim was not to create multiple copies

00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,900
for example not to have n different

00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:00,789
copies for n different clients who would

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,550
like to purchase luma calls white label

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:05,800
version so the aim was to have just one

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,930
copy and have multiple why to label

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:14,110
versions of it so let me not go into the

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,419
detailing of how I implemented it so

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,979
this was the second feature I worked on

00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,669
so since LaMichael is used to make

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:24,159
encrypted voice calls and users who are

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:26,949
using luma call might have more than one

00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:29,050
sip IDs one might be for their work

00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:31,300
purpose or their home purpose and they

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:35,050
would like to designate quiet times and

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:39,969
on their work sape ID only so this

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:41,800
feature was implemented and and so I so

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:44,490
instead of giving just a simple switch

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,500
button which would say on and off

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,349
decided to give it a more detailing for

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,289
example what workdays on what time you

00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:55,370
would like to designate your silent mode

00:06:52,289 --> 00:07:00,380
on your work email or your home email so

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:03,180
say PI D sorry so this was a very fun

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:07,560
feature which I added into lumic also

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:10,199
whenever you use any application with to

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,210
send messages across you might notice a

00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,039
bubble around the text messages so this

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,050
is not just a simple bubble it is a nine

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,120
patch image which resizes itself

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,970
according to the text size and the font

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,680
size and text length so and to create a

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,560
nine patch image there are specialized

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,479
tools which Android provides to create a

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,840
nine patch image and to save the image

00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,909
of the nine patch image you just have to

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,870
prefix for example if the image name is

00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:39,050
image dot PNG you have to save it as

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:43,409
image dot nine dot PNG the number nine

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:45,210
so this so the limit also zip message

00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:47,430
screen was a bit primitive so to make it

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:52,349
more interactive we added the nine patch

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:54,690
behind it so as I said my co-speaker is

00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:58,979
not here today so I would be covering

00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:03,539
his part as well so Pranav was g-shock

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:07,830
sixteen intern with debian and he his

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:10,070
mentors were daniel and soul so he added

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,810
this publish feature in Yamaka and

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:16,319
publish feature is basically a when a

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,659
user and michael would constantly send

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,169
the ping command after a few interval of

00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:25,130
time just to just to signify that the

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,659
user is online and so that the other

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,400
other tools like jet c or JS

00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:33,149
communicator can identify whether the

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,490
person is on available or not and he

00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:39,089
also created a sip and roller a sip and

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,020
roller library which basically allows

00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:44,730
developers to access a paint roller

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,709
functionality and so to use this library

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,450
you just have to import it and call it

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:54,199
normal function and you would be able to

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:57,620
use a second rule of functionality so

00:08:54,199 --> 00:09:00,230
that is it and avid also

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,779
to share how my journey being an

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,600
outreach intern was for example even

00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,700
before the internship began my mentor he

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,320
introduced me to the Debian community

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:14,810
community through a voice video chat on

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,300
jetty and that is when I got to know

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,750
about Jessie as a open software which is

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,350
used to avoid our video calls and there

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:26,450
were times when he figuring while

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,150
figuring out the best code to product

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:32,060
the to produce the best results I was

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:35,120
not paying attention towards decoding

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:38,210
syntax or the indentation or the naming

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,730
conventions which by which are being

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,930
used so since Annie open-source software

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,730
has got contributions by many developers

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,920
around the world and they have their own

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,500
naming convention style etc and you have

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,450
to adore to it so that was something I

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,060
was not being but much attention to and

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,920
my mentors while review reviewing my

00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:02,690
code they gave me true feedback which

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,459
helped me to grow as a developer and so

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,920
I would really like to thank my mentors

00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,930
for being there and finding ways to

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,380
guide me but they left enough room for

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,959
me to explore on my own that is it I

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,790
would like to thank the DEF CON team

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,500
also without whom I wouldn't be able to

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,370
stand here and speak to all of you

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,370
thanks

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,090
any questions if anybody has

00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,150
so for me I think of to achieve was

00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,070
something in initially I thought I

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,380
wouldn't be able to do and I was so

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,270
scared of contributing to an open-source

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:28,630
software but thinking that I wouldn't be

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,490
able to do so outreach as as you know it

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,530
aims to uplift the participation of the

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,550
Android represented section I think for

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:40,450
me it really helped me to do that and

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:42,550
and since outreach II not like gee sock

00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,580
it has it hasn't gotten hundreds of

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,710
students it and it has got like around

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,080
fifty students per round and each round

00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,690
happens twice in an year so that makes

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,030
it one hundred students per year so I

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,940
think it is reaching out to a

00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:02,020
significant amount of women and keeping

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,530
in mind the funds which they have to you

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,690
know have in order to pay their interns

00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,520
so I think it is reaching out to a

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,920
significant amount of women and me as an

00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,510
outreach intern I think I'm able to

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,230
reach out to more women around my

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:19,450
campuses and two women developers I know

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,700
you know helping them out for outreach

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:25,690
around outreach II how to prepare for

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:28,420
outreach II and just you know just

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,730
telling them about the program and I

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:34,350
think just to create awareness is also a

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,350
big step towards a greater good

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:48,050
how did you hear about outreach e yeah

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,820
so I think it's always good to surround

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,490
yourself with people who are there to

00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,100
give information and to support you the

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,230
micro speaker pronoun he so he put up

00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,899
outreach e posters around my camp

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:04,209
University so that is when I got to know

00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:04,209
about outreach program and about Debian

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:25,190
so a great talk can you just go back to

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:25,190
the slide with the messaging

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,920
yeah that one yes so I just want to

00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:38,309
admit that was my implementation on the

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,410
left hand side and it recurs work on the

00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:43,170
right hand side so she deserves all the

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,269
credit for the the appealing user

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:49,769
interface that has been added to blue

00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:53,600
McCall and Vika mentioned the help from

00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:56,459
the mentors including Juliana Lubeck and

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,569
Juliana originally applied for outreach

00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:03,149
e and at the time we couldn't actually

00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:05,790
fund every applicant we got for outreach

00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:07,579
e but she was subsequently selected in

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,679
the next round of google Summer of Code

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:13,949
because we often get a lot more funding

00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:17,429
a lot more places there so so people

00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:20,939
often go from being a an applicant in

00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:23,879
one program to becoming a mentor so in

00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:26,129
this case Juliana helped mentor and

00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,929
Juliana also helped mentor Liz who was

00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:31,439
doing another project at the same time

00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:33,990
and also outreach she has been really

00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:36,749
successful I think Karen Sandler is

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,670
running a session about outreach she

00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:41,480
later this week so that's in their

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,480
schedule as well

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:06,540
that's it yeah thank you for your room

00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:14,700
we have thanks a lot

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:14,700
