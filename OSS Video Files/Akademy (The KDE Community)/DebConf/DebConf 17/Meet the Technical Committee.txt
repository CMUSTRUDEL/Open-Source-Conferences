is it time yes overdue good welcome to

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,710
this meet the Devon Technical Committee

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,119
both its intended to be above so don't

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,150
hesitate if you have questions or

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,150
remarks or other type of communications

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,590
with us we have a small presentation so

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,060
I will start with that but if you have

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:33,600
questions don't hesitate so the current

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,970
event EC members are mostly all here on

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,870
stage I'll start in order so we have

00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:45,660
Keith myself as chair toll-f some Phil

00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:48,360
margarita Marga David and Nico Tina his

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,309
unfortunately at home couldn't attend up

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,760
conferred hi is probably following up on

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:57,180
the video stream but what is the

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,859
Technical Committee all in all you

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,539
probably all read the Debian

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,730
Constitution more than once and you know

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,789
that 6.1 chapter talks about the

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:09,330
Technical Committee and what it does the

00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:11,310
Technical Committee may has a set of

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,090
powers and one of these is to decide on

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,819
any matter of technical policy it has

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,979
also decide on any technical matter

00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,970
where developers jurisdictions overlap

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:28,319
and make a decision when asked to do so

00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:31,020
it's subtitled as a tiebreaking and it

00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,910
can also according to 6:1 for overrule

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,130
the developer but it requires a three to

00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:39,649
one majority so we also act as a last

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:42,479
resort body we can override developers

00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:45,239
but we can also offer advice the six one

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,479
five point in the constitution does that

00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:52,830
and we are bound by a certain set of

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,380
constraints 63 three says that we have

00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,289
to have public discussion and decision

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,450
making

00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:04,979
625 said we cannot do detailed design

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,420
design work and six three six says that

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,640
the Debian Technical Committee makes

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,920
decisions only as a last resort after

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,310
all attempts to resolve the problem but

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,740
the consensus have been tried and failed

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,630
if I quote that correctly by heart

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,420
we also constitutionally

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,490
to break ties amongst available options

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,410
so we are picking options that are on

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,480
the table and we're not supposed by the

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,060
Constitution to come up with solutions

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,770
ourselves so after all afford to reboot

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,880
solve it's by consensus have been tried

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:37,680
and failed it's what I just said we can

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,310
also offer advice and make our views

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,050
known so that also means that the TC can

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,700
offer you advice if you have a technical

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:49,440
problem or something related to Debian

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,900
in general that you want advice on we

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,520
are the one of the bodies you can go to

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,350
if you want advice how you want to

00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,260
handle that technical problem so in

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,150
short the Debian technical committee is

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,300
a self-nominated

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,250
and DPL appointed last resort conflict

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,030
resolution and advice providing body

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,770
it's very beautiful welcome back to the

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,720
self nominated and Dipel appointed

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,940
points later it's been a tradition of

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,680
the Technical Committee both to review

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,830
the issues we've had since the previous

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,510
DEP conf so if you want to see the

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,480
previous previous issues you have to go

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,850
watch last year's both but for this year

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,440
so we've went through the issues that we

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,270
have had in front of the technical

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,970
committee since the last step conf and

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,920
actually when I wrote the slides

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,080
initially I thought oh we only had two

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,920
or three issues actually it was not

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:50,150
exactly the case

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,520
we've had six membership bugs so to say

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,920
we track all the decisions we take

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,500
through bug reports so we've had three

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,860
new members in the person's of Marga and

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,860
Bremner than Nikko congratulations

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,540
and we have decided as internal

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,670
procedure that every time the membership

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,349
changes so whenever someone leaves or

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:19,699
when someone joins we have another vote

00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:21,320
to decide on the ctc chair it's the

00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,020
Constitution doesn't require us to do

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,979
that but we do it as a matter of not

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:31,669
having to ask for a vote for the chair

00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:34,789
and so far I've had the honor to be

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:44,750
elected every time as chair so that

00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:47,690
means I'm preparing the slides we've

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,660
categorized the decisions we have had in

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:53,120
our in our hands in two categories and

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,490
the first one is the issues we have

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,050
actually decided so it's three issues in

00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,030
which we have actually have a vote had a

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,970
vote on it and we have closed the issue

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,699
after a formal resolution there was a

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:09,050
how to shoot the TC help with a project

00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:11,930
roadmap to which we have inserts that we

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,169
are ready to help to break ties but we

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,979
don't really want as a TC to be the body

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:20,449
doing a project roadmap directly I don't

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:23,150
know if any of you guys want to comment

00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:26,960
on that or I just go up go on and you

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,789
interrupt us me there was the blends

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,240
tasks must not be priority important

00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:35,840
that was conflict within the Debian

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:40,940
installer where if I remember correctly

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:44,270
the tasks is the priority system was

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,949
used to make sure blends could be

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,710
installed through the Debian installer

00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:52,550
and we have done some mediation there

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:54,169
and recommended that well we did a

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,780
recommendation on how the problem should

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:59,120
be handled it was solved in by other

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:02,690
means but we acted as a recommendation

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,909
there and then quite recently as well as

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,590
already highlighted by the DPL we had

00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:10,610
the question of whether we should rename

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,990
nodejs back to node which we managed to

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,479
take a decision quite quickly saying

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,669
well the namespace is free again so

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,149
nodejs might as well be named no

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:23,459
so we insert yes there was actually

00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:25,499
seven bugs that were closed without a

00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:28,529
formal resolution and we just discussed

00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:30,449
that in within the TC and and it's quite

00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:32,279
surprising that we are happy to close

00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:35,249
issues without formal resolution where

00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:36,929
our main constitutionally required way

00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:38,969
to take decisions is to have actual

00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:41,789
votes but there are plenty of cases

00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:43,319
awake made make sense to not go through

00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:46,109
an actual vote where it's obvious that

00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,269
we have consensus and we don't have to

00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:50,849
go through that means criteria of doing

00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:53,159
annex an explicit vote and having a

00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:56,159
lengthy resolution and wording and all

00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:57,989
that so there are these seven bucks we

00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:01,079
close them without having to take a vote

00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:04,559
so we had to about browserify JavaScript

00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,929
and DFS g2

00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:09,479
so the first bug we clarified the

00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:12,479
responsibilities and bounced that back

00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:16,709
to the ftp master and did that again a

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,209
second time there was a police clarified

00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:21,149
that sees via net support decision is

00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:25,019
not going to expire we refused to rule

00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:28,259
on that saying yeah what what I just

00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:30,419
said we refused to decide on that we had

00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,669
a longer one overruling the maintainer

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:35,059
of the global package to package a new

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:38,009
upstream version in time for stretch and

00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:40,429
the result of that discussion was that

00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:42,209
the maintainer of the global packaged

00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:45,659
orphans the package

00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:47,819
so the problem disappeared so that the

00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:49,769
package became frites for adoption for

00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,219
someone else to actually do the

00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:55,529
packaging of the new upstream version we

00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:57,749
had to decide on a proper solution for

00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:03,239
the B nutrients MIPS bug actually it was

00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:05,759
a it was a bug in in binutils where if I

00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:08,129
remember correctly the it the new

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,429
version was creating failure to build

00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:14,279
from source for some MIPS bug for for

00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:19,409
some MIPS packages so we did some

00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:21,649
migration there and the solution was

00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,649
found

00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:29,860
without us having to vote we had another

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,510
request to clarify that the USSR pinfu

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,690
should not be hard-coded and even in

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,280
upstream parts we had a quick discussion

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,849
and also declined to rule in that case

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:44,560
and then the browserify JavaScript issue

00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:45,940
came back in in another form the

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,410
question of supporting configuration

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,500
file changes between the versions in

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:53,200
unstable and testing and it was obvious

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,880
that it was obvious for us that the

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,390
issue didn't need a resolution from us

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,690
because it was consensual enough within

00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:03,610
the project that we didn't have to rule

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:08,830
any questions remarks so far is it

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:11,050
boring I'll just go and then and

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,820
actually we have one currently open

00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,770
issue that is a advice on dealing with

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,050
grub upgrade failure caused by init

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,200
select it's a question by Coleen Watson

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:23,740
about how to handle configuration files

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,330
of abandoned packages or of disappearing

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,240
packages because if you don't purge a

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,460
package some configuration files can

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,380
stay on the system but they can be

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,050
hurtful for other packages so there was

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,920
a question whether it's OK in terms of

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,210
policy for grub to take over a

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,070
configuration file from another package

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:45,250
that has disappeared from the archive

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:48,670
and we have consensus that it's OK to do

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,260
it and that's not hurting it's not

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:55,660
against policy but we still need to

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:57,310
actually close the plug saying that we

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:03,340
have consensus that it's ok in this case

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:06,160
yes thank you I also like to really

00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:09,250
thank Colin for a nice bug that was and

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,290
how well presented it was and every

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,050
option was laid out if you want to get a

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,150
quick decision from us if you do

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:19,830
something like that it'll go much better

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,830
than if you start shouting at the start

00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,500
eight six five nine to nine

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,899
I hope it's correct you can always go to

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:36,660
bugs that deserves a round of applause

00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:38,040
for that actually it's really good you

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,500
can always go to the Technical Committee

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:48,450
bug report page where you see all the

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:51,959
current bugs in case so so that that was

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,490
for the current issues we have another

00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:57,779
subject we want to talk about is that we

00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:01,110
are often looking for new members that

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:03,930
is in the Constitution now since four

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:07,260
years I think we have the term expiry in

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,089
the six to seven point I just read that

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,250
out loud so on January 1st of each year

00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:13,950
the term of any committee member who has

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,870
served more than 42 months and who is

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,270
one of the two most senior members is

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,670
set to expire on December 31st of that

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,680
year you actually need to read that

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,149
multiple times and write the formulas

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,880
down to actually understand what it

00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:29,790
means so I did the calculus for you what

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,020
it means is that Keith's term will

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:35,790
expire at the end of this year but as

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:39,270
it's the only term that will expire we

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,890
only have one person who leaves but next

00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:43,290
year there are three terms so my term

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:46,050
talipes term and Sam's term that expire

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,750
at the end of 2018 but only the two

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:53,760
first ones will expire because we expire

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:55,380
at most two per year and so that's the

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,200
these are the dates of the expiration we

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,770
also noticed that if Tola for myself

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,459
resigns during 2018 we force some to

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,459
expire as well

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,550
that's a it's not a loophole but it was

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:17,050
just funny to discover so we we need

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:19,339
fresh blood thank you for the evil of

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,920
that means we're looking for at least

00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:26,480
one new member per year so we are still

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,130
on the so this year we will have we will

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
need one but next year we'll need two

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,000
and the regular rhythm is that we need

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:37,850
two person two new persons per year

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,490
actually and not all issues are like

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:45,170
seven to seven seven zero eight who

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:50,140
knows what that bug is system D yes it's

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:52,420
actually a bug tracker low tester I

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:55,790
think it's still the longest bug ever

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:59,360
with something like seven seven thousand

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:02,570
males something like that so don't go

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,010
and read it it's way too long so we want

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,770
to quickly talk about what's what

00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:09,380
actually our work the what the TC work

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:12,110
is about because we want to find new

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,870
members at least one before the end of

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:18,920
this year act ideally so our work is

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,870
often more social than technical it's

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,420
also about disagreements and conflicts

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,930
by construction I mean that's that's

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:29,540
what we do is like solving conflicts

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,070
it's at the broad technical level so you

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,060
don't have to be a C expert I'm

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:37,250
definitely not but you have to be able

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,140
to have a wider view on how they've been

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,750
works and how the different things

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,630
interact with each other and you have a

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,670
good understanding of what happen is is

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,459
about listening to what people have to

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,230
say so it's the name is Technical

00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,750
Committee but actually it's often about

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,760
what the people are doing and what their

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,029
what their opinions are about the

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,160
technical problems it's also sometimes

00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:03,440
taking hard decisions as was outlined

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,390
before we can override developers it's

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,750
not a fun thing to do but we if we have

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:11,570
to do it and we'll do it and all in all

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:14,110
it's essentially political so in that in

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,760
terms of course we're not talking about

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,259
wider society problems but it's it's

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,609
still how people interact with

00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:24,499
each other how they collaborate as

00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:26,779
humans and and all that and the required

00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:28,459
skill sets to come in the in the

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:31,579
Technical Committee you don't have to

00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:33,949
take all the all the boxes but that kind

00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:36,229
of gives you an idea of what types of

00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:39,439
people were looking for so we need to

00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:41,989
have some empathy technical agility so

00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:43,189
the ability to like dive and in a

00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:45,589
technical area that you don't

00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:48,439
necessarily know but be able to get an

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:51,319
understanding of that problem some sense

00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:54,769
of mentorship ideally some

00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:57,019
responsiveness so that we don't let the

00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,329
bugs die in limbo because no one has

00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:00,709
time to end to answer or even reads the

00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:03,979
mails that are sent to the Technical

00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:06,789
Committee some social sensitivity and

00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:10,399
ideally you should be cool-headed

00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:12,529
because the issues can-can flame up

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,929
slightly so it's it's good if you can

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:17,809
take a step back and take a look at the

00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:22,459
wider view and approach the problems

00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:25,459
with a cool head one important point is

00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:31,459
that we need more diversity we're all

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:33,410
white we have one woman and a lot of us

00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:36,129
are native English speakers I'm not but

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,689
we're still it's 5050 for now which is

00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:40,910
not the best situation to be in

00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:45,319
so we're definitely more need more

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:47,239
diversity yeah one of the one of the

00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:52,600
things we also is we're discussing this

00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:59,239
earlier we have a lack of diversity in I

00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:01,730
think you know we're all closer to older

00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:04,489
school programmers in a certain way you

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,289
know I think as it was pointed out

00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:08,119
there's perhaps over a representation of

00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:13,249
Emacs Lisp on the technical committee is

00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:13,869
composed to say the latest in GUI and

00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:18,019
GUI

00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:23,479
IDs and graphical design environments

00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:25,939
for code you know we probably write make

00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:28,329
files more than we drag and drop build

00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:28,329
systems

00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:42,379
and and actually that's not a good thing

00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:44,569
just to I mean to follow up on to follow

00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:47,300
a I mean I okay we all have a certain

00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:50,329
monkeys mo I guess but to follow up on

00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,769
DJ's point you don't have to be an

00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:56,959
old-school programmer to be on the

00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:58,370
technical committee well just to resolve

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,199
the nodejs issue it would have been

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:04,059
lovely if we'd had somebody on the T C

00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:08,270
who'd actually ever programmed in nodejs

00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:13,819
their instance so I'm teaching it in

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:21,380
September so so you'll start programming

00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:24,860
it in October and so many diversity we

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:27,649
also need nominees and the current

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,899
process is that you should write to the

00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:32,240
Technical Committee private alia alias

00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:34,640
or any of us saying I think this person

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,630
would be good or saying I think I'm a

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,299
good person because we also wanna pick

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,919
from a set of good candidates and if the

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,890
set is too small and it's really hard

00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:48,679
for us to just blankly blank accepts

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:52,669
whoever is the poor soul that got

00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,020
nominated there is a question at the

00:17:52,669 --> 00:18:00,049
back of the room I don't know if we have

00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:02,440
microphones how big was that do we want

00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:02,440
to say that

00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,480
500 thereabouts so the question was how

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:23,160
much how big was the set and the answer

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:26,950
is about five my understanding is that

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:29,890
we've decided over at least on this side

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:33,520
of the the room that we need a better

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:35,230
nominations process and Keith's leaving

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,090
and I tried to convince Keith to handle

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:41,050
this but you know he wasn't willing to

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:44,050
do that so um you know kind of in the

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,700
wedding bouquet style I have this ball

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,890
here and I'm going to throw it out into

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,790
the audience and you should consider

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:56,100
yourself empowered to optionally give us

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,100
a nomination and pass the ball along I

00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:09,910
actually suspected that might happen and

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:13,180
I think that is that shows it is a

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:26,070
little bit challenging to fill the TC

00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:26,070
spot we already nominated

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,610
the trouble is of course that this is

00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:48,090
not at all diverse because you all came

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,590
to Deb Kampf and so you know loads of

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,270
people that come to Deb Kampf and

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,180
they're much more likely to get

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,860
nominated and all that I did do a thing

00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,430
where I was randomly selecting people

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,620
and sending them emails doing this in

00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,240
the previous round and it didn't really

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,880
bear fruit but it would be really nice

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,250
if people could come up with nominations

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,010
because there's this thing about groups

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:14,070
of people knowing more people that know

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:17,040
lots of people then so the idea was that

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:19,890
if you select someone from the community

00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,080
at random they will know someone that's

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,730
quite representative then who knows lots

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:36,860
of people which is quite a good sort of

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:39,060
mix for the Technical Committee bill I

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,900
am very confused

00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:44,700
I thought your random thing like was the

00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,430
best enhancement to the nomination

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,620
process ever I thought like I think it

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:53,810
actually did substantially influence the

00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:57,750
process in good ways okay cool I was

00:20:53,810 --> 00:21:00,060
obviously expecting much more and it did

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:04,230
something so I can carry on running that

00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:06,240
it's I did it in a way that it uses

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,130
publicly available data and runs it

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,170
through or a crypto thing to generate

00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:15,000
the list so you can check whether I'm

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:16,590
cheating and yeah so it's not just me

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,280
picking people that I like to nominate

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:26,430
people okay so the first hundred honor

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,280
is it getting here yes no okay

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,990
so is the first person who ever

00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,790
term-limited out after that resolution

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,500
was in you can certainly take everything

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,410
I have to say with you know suitable

00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,060
quantities of salt but I'm actually I

00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,500
actually get really concerned when I

00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,720
hear people talking about diversity

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,910
without having some sort of really

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,280
specific set of objectives or some

00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,770
specific problem they're trying to solve

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,020
I too would love to make sure that the

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:54,360
Technical Committee remains or becomes

00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,300
even more a sort of a representative

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,980
swath of the project but I get worried

00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,890
if you start worrying about you know

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,290
gender or skin color or you know make

00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:06,570
files over drag and drop because while

00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:09,360
those are all good indications of

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:12,030
whether you know their their markers for

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,890
whether it's diverse enough that none of

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,510
them are actually sort of the point so

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,460
don't get don't beat yourselves up too

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,370
much and if somebody really great is

00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:23,130
available and wants to contribute and

00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,690
would have something to add don't be too

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,760
hung up about it if they happen to be

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,990
you know old and white or something and

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,030
no no please don't look at me I I

00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,830
wouldn't be concerned about us being

00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:38,520
hung up about that I mean of course

00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:41,970
people have to be competent and good

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:46,050
people regardless of their their sex or

00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:48,180
their skin color or whatever but if we

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,730
can increase the diversity then there is

00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,950
absolutely value in that and there is an

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,230
important point about self selecting so

00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,540
we have an inherent bias in the process

00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,460
that as a body we select other people to

00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,400
join us so we're more likely to select

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,650
people that are like us so we need we

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:10,770
need input from people not like us if we

00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:13,880
want them to be considered at least for

00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:17,100
for me I think it's more interesting to

00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,410
encourage people to apply without a

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,080
fixed set of prerequisites I think

00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:25,500
that's what I want to push rather than

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,450
saying oh my god we have to find a

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,740
random nodejs developer and get them on

00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,870
the technical committee by the end of

00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,230
the day well apparently we did that

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:36,680
already because Here I am but I'm pretty

00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,680
random

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:45,160
so another point we wanted to get across

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,679
also is that we are but I think we told

00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,980
that already we're normal

00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,690
we're just developers so come talk to us

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:56,440
if you have worries questions or else I

00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:58,090
mean we are not like I I think I talked

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,700
to someone the other day and he was like

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,890
oh but I'm not in the same high Spears

00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,720
as you are we're not in the high Spears

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,150
at all we're just developers with duty

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,580
to solve complicated technical problems

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,710
or social problems and it's it's not a

00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:18,580
high sphere at all so come to us where

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:21,039
we're normal yeah hello what are the

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:28,870
lifestyle impacts of being in the

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:35,770
Technical Committee was that not all

00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:39,429
issues are alike systemd what's my it's

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,730
very spiky because we don't get it's not

00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:44,620
like a regular thing that you have to do

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:47,919
the same amount of work every day every

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:51,429
week every month like suddenly we get a

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,950
bug report that is super hot and and in

00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:55,900
three days we get a hundred emails right

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,120
and you need to be able to read those

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,179
hundred emails in those three days or

00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,850
you're left behind but then nothing

00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:07,929
happens for two months so it's not

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:10,690
something that you can like plan to

00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:13,659
spend its certain amount of energy every

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:17,799
day you just need to like have a window

00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:20,830
where you will do that work and it's

00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:23,289
also quite heavy it may be not a good

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,980
word but it's it triggers a lot of

00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:28,539
reflections and it's writing the email

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,570
at the end of your if reflection is the

00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:33,100
easy part but it's it you spend a lot of

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,510
time thinking about what you will write

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,320
and how you will write also because the

00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:40,870
process is public so it's and by

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,059
definition all the issues that come to

00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:46,150
the TC come at a point where it's often

00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:48,010
late and so there's a lot of untangling

00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,020
to do to actually understand the problem

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:52,330
and understand the issues at stake so

00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,460
it's it's quite some energy

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:58,110
but it's also rewarding in the sense

00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:03,840
that we help fix some problems I think

00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:07,269
thankfully there are other questions I

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,730
will just finish the slide so that we

00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:12,669
can get to the bar after that after

00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:15,490
after that so we're also looking into

00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:17,590
ways to improve the process the

00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,860
recruiting process as well as our

00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:22,149
general bug handling process but I don't

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,260
remember exactly where I had that slide

00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:28,210
so I'll just go to the next one

00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:32,409
so our current discussions that are not

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:35,559
spark specific we actually just had this

00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:37,600
one the hour before is how quick we can

00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,480
be and we were actually surprised both

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,159
ways for some issues we thought the

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,019
system D for example we thought oh that

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,720
took a year actually it only took six

00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:48,220
months and for other issues we thought

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,010
oh that took multiple months and

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,529
actually took only one so we have a real

00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,120
understanding of how long we take to

00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:57,490
actually decide and actually we are

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,630
faster than we thought on multiple ones

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:08,769
so we've became better and yeah but I'll

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:11,909
let some and hence yes I I think an

00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:17,409
important thing to understand is that

00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:19,960
typically it takes for the T you should

00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:23,860
you should not be surprised if it takes

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:28,330
the TC multiple months to respond to an

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:30,580
issue if - - excuse me to resolve an

00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:34,299
issue to get all the way through that

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:37,029
said if that timeline doesn't work for

00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:39,340
you be honest about what your needs are

00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:42,970
at the beginning and we'll see what's

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,919
possible sometimes it has been possible

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,740
and I think that the shortest we

00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:54,100
produced a resolution in is five days

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:56,350
from bug two to a formal resolved

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,380
resolution well that's a case where the

00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:01,360
project really needed it and where it

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:04,529
happened that it was easy for the TC to

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,529
get an internal consensus

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:10,360
normally it's going to take longer than

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,330
that but you may be able to get some

00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:18,640
idea earlier in the process to help you

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:20,500
start to move in a direction as

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,720
mentioned earlier there as well it

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,789
really helps if you have actually your

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,539
whatever the problem is written up well

00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:30,789
rather than pointing out a bug report

00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:33,010
spanning you know three months with

00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:35,679
people being upset and personal attacks

00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:40,029
and old about things we sometimes see in

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,789
Debian yeah if you want to get a nice

00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:44,980
hearing from me then really don't say

00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:47,919
someone already addressed that point in

00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:50,649
the thread you know if you want to say

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,059
that then say here and here I quoted

00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:54,520
again so you don't have to go and look

00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:57,100
for it saying oh I already addressed

00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,750
that you just went down about three

00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:05,830
points in my estimation if you say that

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:07,870
really pisses me off because I'm

00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,279
Dyslexic so it takes me four times as

00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,789
long to read this stuff as anybody else

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,789
so yeah

00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,560
I told myself I wouldn't I told myself I

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,440
wasn't gonna ask a question at this one

00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,350
we see how well that held up I was

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,590
wondering about yeah to get a little bit

00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:34,180
back to a person's question over here in

00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:36,440
the corner and to link it with the

00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,210
subjective perception of time to

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,290
resolution that you guys have I'm

00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:44,450
wondering if it isn't if when you look

00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:47,810
back on something and think oh the you

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:50,450
know the in it situation took a year to

00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:52,910
resolve and this other one that we

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:56,990
thought took two months took one if that

00:29:52,910 --> 00:30:01,730
might not be more a measure of your

00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:05,480
level of comfort with the issue I wasn't

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:09,350
around for the system D in it Wars but I

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:13,070
watched them from the pages of lwn and I

00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:15,950
I read a lot of the deliberations on the

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:19,450
subject which is how Rus Albury came to

00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:23,980
my attention as a pretty kick-ass dude

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:27,440
so do you think that's the the case and

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,940
secondly is you know you talked about

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,950
diversity I'm trying to tie a bunch of

00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,210
things together here is the person who

00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,780
kind of wants to be on the technical

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:37,250
committee don't they have to be the kind

00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:42,190
of person who's prepared to deal with

00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:44,150
spiky high stress episodes like that and

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:46,610
that's one area where you can't

00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:49,490
diversify into into people who want you

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,170
know a predictable workload just some

00:30:49,490 --> 00:31:01,070
thoughts there tell me if I'm wrong

00:30:51,170 --> 00:31:04,520
probably am I'm happy to repeat my

00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:08,540
previous answer what - huh

00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:10,910
this fell off no I mean I think the

00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:14,180
thing again the thing about diversity is

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:19,130
to lower barriers so to lower perceptual

00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:21,470
barriers so and yeah I think anybody

00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:25,340
who's been around Debian for a year or

00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:28,400
more probably you won't be on the T C in

00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:31,010
your first year but you never know knows

00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,210
that there will be stress

00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:37,250
or at least you know that there will be

00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:39,650
emotional issues that come before right

00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,230
people are invested in these things they

00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,960
don't get to the TC if people aren't

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:47,570
invested in them so I don't really see

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,850
that as a diversity issue I mean I guess

00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,920
we're not looking for we're not looking

00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,620
to expand our complement of thin-skinned

00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,700
people right I guess it may be I don't

00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:01,850
understand your question

00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:03,170
I'm a missing something I think what I

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,170
understand of your question is that

00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,610
these spiky workload that is associated

00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:11,420
with a lot of stress when the spike

00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:13,940
comes might deter some people and then

00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:19,070
we get a profile of a person that is

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:22,430
willing to put up with spikey stress but

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:25,210
I mean that's kind of all over Debian

00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:29,480
right we have people in key positions

00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:34,550
because they're the ones who can do them

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,930
and not go burn out right away so I

00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,760
don't know it's not you know I think

00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,260
that's not unique to that you're right

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,930
but I think it's not unique to the TC I

00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:45,740
think a lot of moderately high

00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:50,180
visibility positions within doubt debian

00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:52,330
have this feature hi Shawn new policy

00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,330
other

00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:09,290
so on the on a hopefully somewhat less

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,360
spiky sort of thing but speaking of

00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,490
policy so if some of the one of the

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,800
things that you used to want to do when

00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,480
I was on the TC was to try to use the

00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,250
Technical Committee is of mechanism for

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,760
resolving some of the things that are

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:24,170
long-standing in Debian where they are

00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,000
actually aren't all that hot like

00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:28,490
nobody's really super excited about them

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,070
but the project would be better off if

00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,500
we would actually make a decision

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:35,390
because we're in some limbo land and we

00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,560
just sit there for forever a bunch of

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:41,030
those tend to land in the policy B TFS

00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,830
where we will never probably get

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,450
consensus on a particular resolution

00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:47,210
because there are people who really

00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,010
would like it to work either way but the

00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,810
project as a whole would probably be

00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,400
better off if we just made a decision

00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,230
now let's kind of wanted to get your

00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,320
take on what you'd feel about us

00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,390
starting to forward more of those to the

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,860
Technical Committee a great example and

00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:03,590
I'm just going to give it as an example

00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,600
and ask the room to not start talking

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,409
about it is one of those things that

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,790
we're up tin to a conversation is that

00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:12,890
long-standing question in Debian is if

00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:15,440
you install a pack if you upgrade a

00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:17,330
package and the net script fails to

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,399
start the daemon do you abort the

00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,200
package installation or not and there's

00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:23,179
lots of arguments on both sides of this

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,620
and some packages do one and some

00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:27,230
packages do the other that seems like

00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,940
the kind of thing there's a policy open

00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,280
policy bug what would you all think of

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,600
us forwarding those kinds of things onto

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,159
the Technical Committee that is one of

00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,649
our constitutional roles is to offer

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,659
advice so if you want advice in that

00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:40,310
issue absolutely come and ask us for

00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:43,040
advice and we'll come up with we either

00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:46,820
say we have no idea or this is our

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,200
opinion as a as a body and as kind of a

00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,120
set of developers who might have an

00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,740
alternate view that certainly something

00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:57,200
were constitutionally empowered to do

00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:59,030
and and we certainly encourage that in

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,130
that case even constitutionally

00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:05,420
empowered to make a decision I think I

00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:07,040
would be delighted if you forward it

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,870
stuff like that I would be delighted if

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,600
the Technical Committee got more things

00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:14,440
that were hey we'd like you to ask you

00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,420
to do this rather than ever then

00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,710
then we've already gotten to a point

00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,250
where we're snapping each other's

00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:25,060
throats and I think this is a case where

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:26,950
that could happen that said you

00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,170
shouldn't be surprised if sometimes you

00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:33,640
get back rather than a decision you get

00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:35,380
back at advice more than a decision you

00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,560
shouldn't be surprised as sometimes you

00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,869
get back we don't think that you can set

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,550
policy here the best you can do is to

00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:48,520
describe the trade-offs and that it will

00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:51,490
be a lot easier for us if you take the

00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,500
time to write a good report of it rather

00:35:51,490 --> 00:36:01,990
than sending us at a 10 mile tenure of

00:35:53,500 --> 00:36:03,700
policy threat hi so I wasn't planning to

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,770
ask a question but apparently it looked

00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,630
like I had my hand up so I know I've got

00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,099
I've got the mic but actually as it

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,280
happens I was sort of thinking about

00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:16,180
something so over the past couple of

00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:19,150
weeks I've been thinking about things

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,740
like us familiar with like things like

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,410
snaps and flat packs and that kind of

00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:25,119
thing so I was thinking about and this

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:28,079
was prompted by thank you for sitting

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,760
around cosmic cosmos talk earlier today

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,560
whether and how much we could possibly

00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,109
push this kind of stuff into Debian now

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,569
this this question can go can probably

00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:39,640
go as deep as you want it to as you want

00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:43,720
it to go right this is it ranges from

00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,339
like do we can we generate these these

00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,690
things from our Deb's and the scrutiny

00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:49,660
users which is possibly like the

00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:52,480
shallowest end of it - can we provide

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,790
our users access to up streams built

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,290
stores by default right now you're

00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,060
frowning but well I'm saying what I want

00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,940
the the TC related thing that I want to

00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,230
ask you is one it feels like this is

00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,730
something that if somebody tried to

00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,740
start pushing on this it would end up at

00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,710
the TC eventually would you want to

00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,270
offer advice on this and number two

00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:13,060
given that I forgot exactly where was

00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:16,030
you raised a point about possibly there

00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,710
being a lack of like technical kind of

00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,569
diversity you were coming from one sort

00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,460
of school of thought do you think that

00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:24,700
it would the TCC would actually be

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,010
qualified to even like give these issues

00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,600
proper confer can

00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,850
consideration given that maybe you

00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,260
haven't I mean you're not you're not

00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,040
sort of coming from that world you might

00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,740
be coming from an old-school

00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,040
debian-based destroy a kind of

00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,150
traditional traditional world like you

00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,530
know I don't want to start this

00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,660
discussion now necessarily but do you

00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:48,450
have some thoughts about whether the TC

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:50,430
would be able to handle this well I'm

00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,680
sure we're not ready to make a decision

00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,810
there I didn't have a proposal to make

00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,790
it I was just thinking about no no but I

00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,760
mean my point is this is an area where

00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:01,710
if you were to ask the TC can you

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,080
evaluate can you help us evaluate the

00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:08,310
technical trade-offs and come up with a

00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,030
deliverable that would look more like

00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:15,390
here are some discussions of trade-offs

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:18,270
to spark some informed discussion mm-hmm

00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:20,940
you would get a lot further than if you

00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:29,310
said can you set policy for flat packs

00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:32,940
hmm I think that there probably is

00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:34,830
expert like I doubt I'm the only one

00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,450
who's I haven't dealt with flat packs

00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:39,600
that I've dealt with many of the issues

00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:41,160
underlying that in commercial contexts I

00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,890
suspect there are other people on the TC

00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:49,490
you've you've dealt with lots of

00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:51,510
different software delivery mechanisms I

00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:54,240
think if you could get the right people

00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,890
together for a discussion having some TC

00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,210
members involved in that discussion and

00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:01,590
producing a a a good discussion of the

00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:05,130
trade-offs for Debian would be a

00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:06,990
wonderful thing for the project I think

00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:09,660
that's that's also quite important point

00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:11,960
is that this discussion needs to happen

00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:14,100
at the project wide level as well

00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,470
probably as prerequisites because

00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,869
deciding whether we enable external

00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,730
religious repositories or not is also

00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:23,160
something we need to decide as a project

00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,770
and we kind of have to find a consensus

00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,510
there before directly going to the TC to

00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,510
actually take to actually rule that

00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:34,109
that's fine we do that all the time

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,770
right so I actually think that having

00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:39,700
the TC or somebody get the technical

00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,530
trade-offs together

00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,890
and feeding that into the broader

00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:47,530
project discussion might derail a lot of

00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:50,890
flaming like I think that we're actually

00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,599
pretty close to being ready to have the

00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,119
discussion of so what are the trade-offs

00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:58,240
for enabling or de positive for enabling

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,440
build stores by default right and I

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,470
think that we could write up those

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,770
trade-offs as an input to the project

00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:07,810
wide discussion and I think that that

00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:10,180
might defuse some other things that

00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:12,400
might be pretty awful if they didn't

00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,560
have a good set of technical trade-offs

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,050
as one of their inputs I think maybe a

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,660
way to do this is to approach the TC to

00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,430
sort of Shepherd the discussion in the

00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,250
wider prod the writer project because

00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:26,560
it's gonna be really hard to formulate a

00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:28,930
formulate a complete proposal and then

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,430
approach the TC and then because it

00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,710
possibly involves so many out you know

00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:36,730
like touching the competencies of the

00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:38,320
FTP team so no I don't I don't know that

00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,900
the TC is necessarily going to be the

00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:44,290
best to Shepherd a proposal I I think

00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:47,920
the TC would be good at discussing the

00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:50,380
technical trade-offs right that's what

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,000
we do is we look at if you look through

00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,400
the system debug for example you will

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,560
find that several people wrote some

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,290
really eloquent discussions of the

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,619
trade-offs if nothing else that was a

00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:04,359
great deliverable I bet we could do

00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:06,430
something in a situation like this I

00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:09,210
think that that would be a lot more

00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:12,880
feasible than asking us to Shepherd the

00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:19,650
discussion or at this time asking us to

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,650
rule on a policy again that's my opinion

00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:27,520
I just want to expand on what Russ said

00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:31,869
about policy team passing bugs to you

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:35,380
guys we this process that we have in

00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:37,990
policy to get consensus as Russ said at

00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:40,990
the both yesterday if a couple of people

00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:45,069
disagree and are not persuaded then that

00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:46,540
process just stops so I think and this

00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:48,430
is often the case for these long-running

00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,990
bugs where it's not urgent but Debian

00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:53,200
will benefit from it being solved which

00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:55,090
is how a spider

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,300
if we were to pass that up to the TC and

00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:01,300
the response was like wait if you took

00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,950
this as us asking for your advice then

00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,650
that wouldn't actually unblock the

00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:09,460
situation because as I say the process

00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:11,530
just stops if there's no consensus if

00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:13,600
you were to say to us okay that's not

00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:16,390
documental just write about the pros and

00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,340
cons that's fine but taking it as

00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:20,710
offering advice when it's come from

00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,960
policy team because we think we're not

00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,520
gonna get consensus doesn't help that

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:33,700
much and probably isn't a great use of

00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:36,730
your time I would say so if the policy

00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:40,990
consensus process stalls does not fit

00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:47,110
the model of all the right processes

00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:50,890
having being followed before it does

00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:56,170
anybody in the audience know what okay

00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:58,420
moving on then okay so does anybody

00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,370
disagree that that would be a vow I mean

00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:04,230
I'm not saying okay it's hard to say but

00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:10,420
it seems like it could be valid TC bugs

00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:14,590
for for an actual decision right if you

00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:16,500
guys say Arkans our process we tried the

00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:20,740
consensus thing and it didn't work out

00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:23,350
then I don't that seems like valid to

00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,770
ask for an actual decision as much as I

00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:28,420
hate to make work for us but in any case

00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:32,890
it's something we should probably try

00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:35,290
and see if we succeed or fail so you can

00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:36,760
try one or two and if it's result is

00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:43,720
necessity satisfactory we should have a

00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:47,860
discussion again talking more about the

00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:51,300
process of taking a decision the most of

00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:54,250
the her does you communicate by email I

00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,910
using like more or considering using

00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:59,110
some more real-time and closer

00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:03,970
communications and particular problems

00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:07,060
like going all the way from IRC chats to

00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:09,990
to phone calls or maybe organized

00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:12,790
in live meetings for a particularly bad

00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:16,090
problem because we all know that

00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:18,850
sometimes some some problems can be best

00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:22,210
solved only by getting the people that

00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:29,050
disagree into one room and then have

00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:30,550
somebody operate yes so we have a

00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,250
constitutional limit for that our

00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:35,230
meetings have to be public and so the

00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:38,920
only credible way for us to do a public

00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:41,110
meeting is email or IRC or video

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,940
streaming yeah yeah one can imagine that

00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:44,770
but that requires in-person stuff so

00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:48,160
like teleconferences I've tried to do

00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:49,330
public meetings via teleconferences it's

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,000
very difficult to get a reasonable

00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:53,560
transcript from that it's very difficult

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,030
to let an arbitrary number of people

00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,700
come and listen in

00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:59,500
whereas with email and IRC you have this

00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:02,440
you have this ability for the entire

00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:04,540
community to watch and I think that's a

00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,970
really powerful part of the Constitution

00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:09,400
here and I want to make sure we we we

00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:11,410
respect that as literally as we can it's

00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,810
like I want to make sure that anybody

00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:16,570
who wants to watch the TC can come in

00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:18,700
and watch they don't have to have a cell

00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:21,100
phone or a phone plan that can dial into

00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:24,940
it to a European number they don't have

00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:26,440
to have magic enough bandwidth on a

00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,200
network to be able to watch a live video

00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,090
stream there's a lot of constraints on

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,830
on that puts a lot of constraints on us

00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,200
and it does mean that we are somewhat

00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:36,970
constrained but I think IRC in

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,300
particular is a pretty powerful tool for

00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:42,490
us it makes it easy for easier for

00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,590
people not using the native who aren't

00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,630
using the same language aren't native in

00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:48,220
the same language is being used to read

00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:50,220
and understand and reply because it

00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:52,960
gives that that not quite real-time

00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:55,090
behavior so you can google google

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:59,080
translate whatever parts you're confused

00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:00,910
about it makes the record exact right

00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,550
there's no conversate there are no side

00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:05,500
conversations in IRC we don't do that so

00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,300
whatever's in the IRC channel is exactly

00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,180
the conversation that occurred and I

00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:12,940
think that's really powerful but some we

00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,920
like to meet here but we don't do any

00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,150
decisions because we can't all you know

00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,670
trying to get a physical meeting of

00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:20,950
eight people together is very difficult

00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:22,960
and a physical meeting of seven people

00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,220
one person remote then all of a sudden

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,400
you have an unbalanced meeting in that

00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:30,040
person's views won't Weavers won't be

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,450
presented as accurately so I I think

00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,790
we've made a pretty good balance with

00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:36,160
IRC I'm reasonably happy with that does

00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,810
anybody think that we need a different

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,480
mechanism you know we can choose a

00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:42,460
different messaging system but text

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,260
messages seems like I mean it my

00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:47,619
children communicate solely by text

00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:49,930
messages surely that TC can can respond

00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:52,810
can respect what the the modern children

00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:55,270
have have figured out well there's one

00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:57,339
thing about the Constitution we can we

00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:59,530
we still have the right to handle some

00:46:57,339 --> 00:47:01,990
parts of discussions in private and we

00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,450
do that for some issues because it's

00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,950
just impossible to discuss some specific

00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:09,430
person-to-person relationship problems

00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:11,260
in public and I think it was the GRS and

00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:13,690
two three years ago about that so that

00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,310
we that it we're explicitly allowed to

00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,859
do some things in private but we try to

00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:19,420
not use it too much that's also why here

00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:21,130
if you see us having a discussion at

00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,930
DEFCON we don't hide in a room we go in

00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,329
the cafeteria and if you want to sit

00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:27,730
down and listen to what we say or even

00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:29,260
interact with us please do and it's the

00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:31,650
same for the IRC meetings we have it

00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:34,300
monthly I think it's the third Thursday

00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:38,349
every month on our seat at dependend org

00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:40,859
you can come oh when they say it's in

00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:40,859
the agenda

00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:52,030
exactly but yeah basically said but it's

00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:55,810
fine to also interact in the IRC meeting

00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:57,880
so and if it's too noisy for us we will

00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:59,829
say but if you have something to say in

00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,930
an IRC meeting just come and say it yeah

00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:03,400
well and in fact in our meeting just

00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,750
before we met here we had a couple of

00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,020
people come and sit down and watch and I

00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,910
appreciate that oversight in any any

00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:12,520
legislative or judicial process is

00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:13,420
really valuable so coming in and talk to

00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,040
us and tell us when we're doing

00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,050
something stupid because we're only

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,940
eight people were just ate little Dee

00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,950
Dee's trying to fix some big problems

00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:24,910
and if you have input to help us that's

00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:27,839
great yes oh and we're out of time now

00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:27,839
we get to go drinking right

00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,809
