	00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:12,120
so hello and welcome my name is Marcus

00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:18,240
Kashani and today I want to talk

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:21,180
about Debian games I'm developer from

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,420
Germany and also a member of the Debian

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,130
games and Java teams

00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:31,169
I'm also contributed through the

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:34,829
long-term support team yeah what

00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:39,600
qualifies me for this talk I have some

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:43,469
gaming experience since the 1980s I've

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,769
been using different computers up to now

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:52,129
like a c64 the Amiga 500 all to modern

00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:57,170
pcs and yeah I was a long time gamer

00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:59,640
enjoyed gaming but more recently I have

00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,409
become a Debian developer and started to

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,080
packaging games and starting to maintain

00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,960
them and nowadays I don't have much time

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,510
anymore to to play games despite the

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:16,410
rumors in 2012 I created a small website

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,770
project called Linux you bots de that's

00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:22,910
basically a simple website with some

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:27,660
statistics and some dedicated servers

00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:31,260
multiplayer dedicated servers basically

00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:34,610
it is about you can find almost all

00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:39,570
dedicated server games on this website

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:42,420
which we provide in Debian and well it

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:46,490
was my fun project to learn more about

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:51,330
Debian games in general and Linux and

00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:54,030
administration here in the meantime I've

00:01:51,330 --> 00:02:00,360
touched already 400 packages in Debian

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:02,190
mostly Java and Debian games and we

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,570
probably won't have enough time for this

00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,090
talk but if you have questions about

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,970
specific games you can always ask me

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:13,730
later and I will probably be able to

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:17,030
answer them so

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:20,060
what do I want to talk about today first

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,670
of all I want to give you an overview

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:27,019
about all our games in Debian main

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:29,599
Debian contra and Debian on free I also

00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:33,099
would like to present you game data

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:37,069
package err it's basically a tool to

00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:39,590
cover the fourth category of games or

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:43,730
games content which is even worse than

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:46,760
non free these are this is a non

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:52,730
distributable content which Debian is

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:54,739
not allowed to legally distribute I also

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,769
want to talk about another project I

00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:03,590
started in 2013 2014

00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:06,349
it's called Debian games planned and how

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:11,780
I tried to improve the visibility of

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:13,819
games in Debian and then I also would

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:19,579
like to talk about creating free content

00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:27,440
and about some ideas for future projects

00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:30,170
or how you can contribute to games first

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,329
of all the gaming industry is really

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:37,370
really big the global game marketplace

00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:41,630
according to Gartner com a research

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:44,600
company as about 100 billion dollars per

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,840
year and there are other numbers and

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:51,380
figures that indicates it is only a

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,810
double-digit figure in the billions but

00:03:51,380 --> 00:04:00,349
it is still quite high and it also

00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:03,889
depends on how they how they may I

00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:06,920
define what what are games and how this

00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,870
marketplace of what kind of games this

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,549
marketplace consists of they basically

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:16,549
say taken to account mobile games web

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:19,669
games PC games console games but also

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:23,419
hardware so it's quite difficult to say

00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:25,909
how big the market really is successful

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,199
games attracts usually millions of

00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:29,780
players

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,370
when we talk about proprietary games for

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,389
example Blizzard Entertainment the very

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:38,479
very very well-known company that

00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:44,270
produced titles like Starcraft warcraft

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:52,340
world of warcraft and diabolo employs

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:58,039
more than 4,500 people and yeah well

00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:02,779
they own or earn millions of dollars per

00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:06,439
month they had 2 million subscribers for

00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:09,580
world of warcraft in the year 2010 that

00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:14,419
was the peak time of the game and in

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:17,870
2008 they decided to create another next

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:22,639
generation MMO nobody knew what it was

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:26,719
back then and they kept it secret but we

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:30,909
discovered in 2014 that he wanted to

00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:35,360
create something well a huge animal

00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:38,180
which basically should combine multiple

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,050
aspects of gaming so it should be a

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:45,849
shooter game or combat games or and you

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:51,710
should also could you could also explore

00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:53,900
society and trade with other people this

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,349
very very complex very very complex

00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:00,289
ideas but then we decided ok it doesn't

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:01,610
work we won't produce it we stopped the

00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:08,029
production we stopped the development

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:10,639
and determinated everything in 2014 they

00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:15,699
employed more than hundred people just

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:18,500
alone for this game and full time and

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,199
they use some of the contents and to

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,689
create another game called overwatch

00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:28,120
which is now the 4th franchise of

00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:32,330
Blizzard Entertainment and it also

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:36,009
attracts more than several million of

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,009
players daily

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:45,050
what it is also a word to note that

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:48,130
proprietary games receive a lot of

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,290
extensive news coverage for example I

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:55,280
discovered last week or two weeks ago a

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:58,280
BBC article about overwatch and this is

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,990
usually something you don't see for free

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,060
and open-source software games yeah well

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,500
what's the difference in contrast to

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:11,840
proprietary games most force games are

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:17,210
developed by only a single person and

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:22,190
this person is someone who does it just

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:23,720
for fun or for educational purposes it

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:29,840
mostly receives no money at all

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:32,500
perhaps some donations and even less

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:39,320
receive money through crowdfunding or

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:41,810
sales or a monthly fee successful games

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,730
in the first world attracts several

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:49,540
thousands of players but not millions

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:52,520
and the communities are rather small

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,410
very small compared to let's say

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,230
Blizzard World of Warcraft with millions

00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:03,230
of players so it is fair to say that

00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:07,240
first games are niche and it should not

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:12,500
be this should sound negatively

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:14,540
it's just realistic so nobody outside

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,690
this room perhaps or in the community

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:20,450
knows a lot about games what games we

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,000
provide and how big they really are and

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:27,830
nobody really talks about them and on

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,590
major news sites we shouldn't really try

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:34,849
to compete with these proprietary games

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:39,080
it is not a matter of freedom what is

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:41,120
more a matter of money resources and how

00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,680
many people I employ to produce this

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,540
content and to produce these games and

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,970
it's very difficult for first game

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,399
developers

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:56,139
to create such a big game that is

00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:58,480
recognized by millions of players so

00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:02,410
many different games are there in Debian

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:06,930
I have not counted them by hand I've

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:11,649
used the Debian games source package and

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:15,970
counted all unique games in all of the

00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:20,110
tasks files and subtracted the library

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:23,170
packages and also subtracted toy games

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:25,860
which are not really games so I finally

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:32,290
found a number and we have roundabout

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:38,589
561 plus if you know KDE and KDE games

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:40,629
so roughly 600 what is most important

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:44,529
about Debian main is that all the

00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:48,519
contents is free software but not only

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:55,300
the code but also all artwork complies

00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:56,980
with the DF f SG and if you take a

00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,120
closer look most of the games are

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,129
written in C and C++ we have very few

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,680
games who are written in Perl

00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:06,189
but one well-known game it's frozen

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,850
bubbles

00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:13,240
the other one is pang zero we have one

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:15,879
Haskell game that's ranked head we have

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,670
three Java games

00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,949
Robo code Robo code is an educational

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:27,129
game a programming game we have free

00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:30,850
core clone of colonization and triple a

00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:35,019
it's a strategy game we have dozens of

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:39,399
peyten games mostly based on the pi game

00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:41,199
engine and we have dozens of d games if

00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,100
you ago i didn't know that something

00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:47,980
like d exists at all but they are really

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:52,230
cool so if you have time check out the

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:54,970
meta packaged games slash shoot-'em-ups

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,850
they are really special i like them

00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,720
because it's in it's all extra

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,880
abstract shooter games

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,090
and I think they are very well written

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:11,150
the problem of T is it is highly

00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:11,150
unstable at least in my experience and

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:18,090
we have to deal every release cycle with

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:22,590
release critical box because something

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:23,970
changed with the compiler and they don't

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,850
work anymore they they cannot be

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,760
compiled from source so if you know D I

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,700
would like to save these games please

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,980
contact us well

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,860
popcorn reports that our most popular

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:41,960
games are have more than 2000

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:46,200
installations our most popular games are

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:51,690
extreme tracks racer or 0 ad super tax

00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:54,360
card something like that and well you

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:59,370
should take popcorn values with a grain

00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,580
of salt because it is this tool is not

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:05,760
installed on every computer by default

00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:10,950
so it is not clear how many people

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:17,760
really use software and it's also not

00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:20,100
clear when we will most let's let's say

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,600
it the other way most people play a game

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,570
and then they remove it from the desktop

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,960
or from their computer again this is in

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:31,200
contrast to tools that you daily need

00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:35,970
like web browsers mail clients your

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,790
packager archiver whatever and so it is

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:43,440
hard to say how many people really play

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:46,020
these games PC games definitely dominate

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,890
in Debian we have very few web or mobile

00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:53,120
games they are almost non-existent I'm

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:58,050
talking about html5 games here and

00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:04,170
theory we could at html5 games for

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:06,720
example Cave Express supports such a

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:10,020
compile option but then I would also

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,360
need to fix the EM script and package

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,000
and hebbian which is currently a bit

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,339
buggy

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:24,069
and doesn't work really really good so

00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:25,779
very very few html5 games and Debian if

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:30,100
you look for developer tools you can

00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:32,680
find them in our game slash def packages

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,889
so if you're interested for example in

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:41,550
C++ development you will find a lot of

00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:41,550
useful libraries and games slash C++ def

00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:50,170
so in my opinion the pros of force free

00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:53,319
open-source software games is that we

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:56,100
can preserve classic games because we

00:13:53,319 --> 00:14:01,319
have the source code and we can reuse

00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:03,610
artwork music files they are free to use

00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:05,410
it's also a great way to learn a

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,829
programming and developing in general

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:14,079
it's quite a fun as I said before many

00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:16,180
developers are people who try to produce

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,870
a new game or try to create a new game

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:25,779
and start by coding a game

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:30,730
the difficulty is you you must also be a

00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:34,209
person who can create game content who

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:36,910
is able to create a good graphic create

00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:39,459
a good sound and only few people can

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,230
manage both it's something related to

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,600
the brain some people are good at

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:47,889
mathematics and others are very creative

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:52,259
so a game creator has to be both at the

00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:55,569
same time and he needs to create a game

00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:58,779
that is fun so you can be a great

00:14:55,569 --> 00:15:03,939
developer but if the game sucks nobody

00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:07,660
will play it you know well and one one

00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:10,589
another point our first games may very

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,600
well integrated into Debian I've

00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:15,819
listened to the talk of Simon about

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,629
flat-pack it's the easy way to install

00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:25,240
games ok but in my opinion Faust games

00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:26,300
are a way to well Debian main is a way

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,080
to package

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:34,280
great force games and they have the same

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:37,010
standard as our other packages so if you

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,930
try to package a complex game like for

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,430
alien invasion

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:44,350
you basically have to invest the same

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:48,730
time as the maintainer of okay it's bit

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:53,420
exaggerated but it's complex enough like

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:56,840
like servers like Apache server or or

00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,760
Tomcat servers so you need to have to

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,590
know how to create a dedicated server

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,950
package but you also must provide a

00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:08,120
desktop client package and you must

00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,830
analyze all the codes if it complies

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,430
with the DFS G and you have to write a

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:17,000
copyright file and for example for you

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,670
for alien invasion there are 5,000

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,340
different graphics on image files in

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:29,510
this package so it is quite hard to

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:32,090
quite hard to find or to analyze this

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,750
package so you invest you have to invest

00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:38,510
some time in it but if you do it you get

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,850
a high quality package because everybody

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,940
knows this file is licensed under this

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,550
license of this license and you can

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,510
reuse it for another project or for

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,980
something completely different

00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,730
you don't have to be a game it could

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:56,420
also be your next video or slide

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,220
whatever and this is not something a

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,680
flat pack would give you you don't

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:06,730
basically not you know basically nothing

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:09,740
about the interiors you know well how

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,930
can we find all those games on Debian

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,650
that was a question I asked myself in

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:18,740
2002 it was rather complicated because I

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:22,330
had to use some command-line tools like

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:26,180
aptitude you can use aptitude search

00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:30,580
section games and you get all the games

00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:33,020
in Debian ok but few people know that

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,990
most people will expect that there's

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:39,480
something like software manager

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,580
application and all

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,250
games are visualized in some way big

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:48,600
icons I want to sort my games and

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:50,850
strategy games in in role-playing games

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,049
and roguelike games and shoot-'em-ups

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:58,100
and so on and this is something which

00:17:55,049 --> 00:18:02,700
was not present in 2002 when I

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:04,919
discovered Debian or Wells we had

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,720
synaptic I believe back then but it

00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,500
still it was difficult to find all the

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,330
games so a Debian games blend it should

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,270
solve the following problem

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:17,910
it should list all games in Debian main

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:21,150
and it should categorize them and

00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:23,429
different categories at the moment we

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:28,640
have 34 meter packages containing 6 not

00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:33,020
93 packages and this includes also

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,020
library packages for game development

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,290
you can take a look we have a home page

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:45,540
at plan step in orc games tasks it's not

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,370
perfect but I think it was very easy to

00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:53,970
create because someone adds that the job

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:55,890
already my goal or my dream is that we

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,990
create something better perhaps

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:02,040
something listed under game starts

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:04,169
Debian orc but we need someone with the

00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,740
skills to create such an webpage who

00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:11,580
knows HTML CSS JavaScript and make

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,309
something more beautiful how does it

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,600
work

00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:18,299
creating major package is very simple

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,150
there are different techniques but a

00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:23,160
debian games blend makes it very easy

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:26,120
about other blends framework in general

00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,620
makes it very easy so you can basically

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:34,440
put one line in your debian roots file

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:36,809
include all the necessary commands you

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,520
have to depend on blend staff at debian

00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:41,900
control we have to write a simple

00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:46,530
control stop file which contains only

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:48,450
the minimum of lines required to to

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,450
create a debian control file and the

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,870
rest is simple text files are simple

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:56,309
text files

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:59,559
in your task directory where one line

00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:01,870
indicates a dependency or recommendation

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:05,490
for one game or a suggestion

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:08,039
and then you ran make dist and

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:11,380
everything will automatically be created

00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:16,320
you get all the other binary packages

00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:16,320
and well that's it basically

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,029
while some recommendations here if

00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:23,470
you're new to Debian game so I have

00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:25,510
never heard of the games made of

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:29,230
packages before please check out games

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:33,870
finest these are the 100 recommended

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:36,370
games chosen by myself I know I know

00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:39,460
it's because of popcorn value I've

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:43,120
chosen them or because I thought unique

00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,809
gameplay they had a unique gameplay they

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,120
looked great

00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:49,360
or yeah well they were simply

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,880
outstanding in in some way so why did I

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,289
choose 100 packages when I mentioned

00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,480
this number last time at DEFCON 15 some

00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,820
people rolled their eyes because yeah

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,760
100 bits

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:06,250
isn't it a bit much I could also choose

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,559
10 the top 10 of divinium so the top 25

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:13,149
but what does that mean it's very

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:15,070
subjective and I have decided that lets

00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:18,850
choose 100 games which are really good

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:21,659
and this will guarantee that people will

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,659
find ya

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:42,410
is there is there a way to have default

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:45,290
games pre-installed just even just a few

00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,330
I keep being asked for a solitaire and a

00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,340
that you know the equivalent of Windows

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:52,850
games and I have to install them

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:56,200
manually for each newcomer so I don't

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,200
know do we want to answer the question

00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:03,470
what we had short before stretch was

00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,780
frozen we had in the Installer the

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:09,640
selection that you could select blends

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,960
games or others Patrice was killed

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,470
unfortunately and so you need to install

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,730
the meta package yourself

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,460
there's the tasks are there this is what

00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,980
he's talking about

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:25,280
yeah yeah the tasks there but you can't

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,610
choose it at install a time you have to

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,660
use its app to install games / finest

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:36,200
and then you will get approximately 10

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:38,540
gigabyte of data it sounds a lot it

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,710
sounds much but if you compare to modern

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:46,429
games a single game can can have more

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:49,549
than 40 gigabyte of data nowadays 10

00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:52,900
gigabyte is nothing and this we are

00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:52,900
talking about hot war not against you

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:05,370
also I think the default install of like

00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:09,660
the gnome desktop or the KDE desktop

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:11,430
used to include like my sweeper

00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,260
solitaire that kind of thing but I think

00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,900
those have been deliberately taken out

00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,760
because the relevant desktop teams

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,130
wanted to kind of prune down how much

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,830
they were installing yeah at the same

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,590
time I don't know about kDa but least in

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:29,250
Nome if you search the overview for like

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:31,320
solitaire gnome shell has integration

00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,560
with gnome software so if you just type

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,210
in solitaire among the search results

00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:41,040
will be hey you can install this

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:42,840
solitaire package from apt so it is

00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:48,630
reasonably easy to get these things like

00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:52,020
on demand so first of all I've

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:54,120
deliberately excluded KDE or genome

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,000
games because I didn't want that users

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,880
pull in complete desktop environments

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,930
KDE games and genome games depend on the

00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,210
whole desktop environment so you would

00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,220
mix two different completely different

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,890
desktop environments and I didn't so

00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:14,100
they are only suggested and all those

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:16,890
meta packages you're right they are

00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:23,760
really big sometimes or solitaire games

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:24,990
are under games board I believe you

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,400
won't be interested in all of them

00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:32,310
that's for sure it's mainly intended to

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,500
be used you look at the meta package

00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:36,600
description and you could install them

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,910
separately but you could also say okay

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,800
forget it I just want to take a look and

00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,230
let's install all of the games and then

00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,710
you could easily remove those that are

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,420
unimportant to you

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,420
because the meta packages don't depend

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,670
on them they recommend them only so it

00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,070
is very easy to just remove the ones you

00:24:53,670 --> 00:25:00,720
don't like and you can keep the ones you

00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:02,730
like that's all about it I think also if

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,310
you seek for volunteer then you need to

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:08,100
know that solitaire exists and so people

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:09,900
end up playing only solid here and the

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,490
meta package it's suggesting things

00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:21,650
you've never heard about

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:25,470
for that's the point more questions okay

00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:28,650
yeah well it's that was mainly the main

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:32,010
reasons for dating games blend what else

00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:37,920
could we do I always wanted to create a

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:41,059
live image of Debian and well I tried to

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:45,510
figure out how it works I studied all

00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:47,910
the relevant packages but I never could

00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:51,510
get it to work never work for me at

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:53,730
least I gave up but this is one thing I

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,500
want to learn about maybe someone else

00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,090
in this room is interested in creating a

00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,260
live image and I think it would be a

00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:03,690
very cool idea because let's take Fedora

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,530
for example they call it spin they have

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,100
a game spin we could also create such a

00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,400
spin

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:20,490
let's let's rename it and call it Debian

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:23,280
games okay that was basically main I

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,580
have chosen to include only games from

00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:30,150
main because I think Debian is all about

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:33,720
free software of course I could include

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,870
contra games and non free games and well

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,429
basically every game that ever existed

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:42,690
what I wanted to draw a line I wanted to

00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:47,429
make sure that we only recommend free

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:49,980
games so what a Debian contra games now

00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:51,660
so the policy says every package and

00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,090
convert must comply with the diva stream

00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:59,670
so all packages and contrib are free

00:26:54,090 --> 00:27:03,780
software but they are there because they

00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:06,660
either built or I thought built depend

00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:11,100
on something non free or they need

00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:13,260
something non free to function and in

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,770
this case it is the the function word

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,450
which is important it's very common in

00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,510
Debian that we have a lot of free

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:25,160
engines but they require non free

00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,160
content for example

00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:35,000
years ago we had sauerbraten in Debian

00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:38,669
contrib at some first-person shooter and

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,490
well the main contents or the image

00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:44,490
files most of them are non free because

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:47,120
they are licensed under a non-commercial

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:53,940
closed license or they may not be

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:58,320
modified very interesting is that for

00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:01,049
example Richard storm on things that the

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,149
art in the game is not software it is

00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:05,460
not ethically imperative to make the art

00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:08,669
free though free art is an additional

00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:12,779
contribution this are his words about

00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:16,529
non free games so in Debian it is

00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:20,760
imperative that free games also have

00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:25,950
free content and otherwise they can't

00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:26,399
enter the Debian main archive but he has

00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:32,600
a point

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:35,429
I mean are PNG files really software

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:39,480
some people and have been argue that way

00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:42,929
they say you must provide the source for

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:47,880
PNG files so a PNG file a JPEG file is

00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:51,210
only it's not the preferable form of

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:56,090
modification may be the developer has

00:28:51,210 --> 00:29:00,299
something better an SVG file or well an

00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:02,600
uncompressed sound file but it's very

00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:07,769
hard to tell if this is really true and

00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:09,779
some people like me I I found a PNG file

00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:12,929
on the internet it was licensed under a

00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:17,190
Creative Commons license share like I've

00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:22,190
used it I modified it and I used it for

00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:25,320
another game I never had the SVG file so

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:30,840
that's a assistant is this a reason to

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:36,920
call again non-free hmm well the problem

00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:39,110
is or the problem exists because in 2004

00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:42,500
we wanted to include scummvm into debian

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:45,890
scummvm is very well known application

00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:53,299
where you can play old adventure games

00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:57,140
and back in 2003 to 2004 the ftp masters

00:29:53,299 --> 00:30:00,350
decided that an engine without free

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:03,830
content cannot enter the main archive so

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:09,910
the lead developer of scandium at this

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:12,760
time asked to a company if they would

00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:18,559
license relicense one of their games and

00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:21,080
so pnath been a steel sky and flight of

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,760
the Amazon Queen entered the archive

00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:28,640
they are BSD license basically and that

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,559
was the reason scummvm could be moved

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:36,290
into the main archive because remember

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,870
may only main comprises Debian basically

00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:45,049
contrib non-free are not part of Debian

00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:46,370
we only provide the resources well on

00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:49,340
the other hand we have a lot of

00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:54,679
emulators and Debian free emulators very

00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:58,549
good ones and the question is do we have

00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:03,490
free content for them yeah I don't know

00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:09,230
but they are in main all of them and I

00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:12,080
believe or I fear we treat some packages

00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:14,630
differently than others and I wonder if

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,470
we really serve the free software world

00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:21,410
very good if we say a completely free

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,929
engine it's not part of Debian of all

00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:32,540
just also although it is free software

00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:37,160
and well some people disagree with my

00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:40,549
opinion and so we have reached a

00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,660
consensus on our team at least and with

00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:43,760
the FTP masters

00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:47,090
we believe that engines can go in Maine

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,770
even without free data also being in

00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:52,429
Maine as long as usable data exists

00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:55,380
so it means you don't have to package

00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:56,460
free contents it is enough if you know

00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:01,070
it exists

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:05,460
somewhere on the Internet so for me

00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:07,170
contrib is a staging area these are all

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,870
games free software but they are not

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:13,620
perfect because they don't provide free

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:15,840
content and you can either say okay

00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,960
forget about the free content we just

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,360
take the non free content like mr.

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,500
Stoneman said it's not a totally

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:31,860
imperative or you can say let's create

00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:34,980
free content let's talk about Dawa

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:41,460
button as our button has a beautiful

00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:43,260
German word it's a dish and well here

00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,350
you can see some potato dumplings and

00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:50,340
red cabbage and that's what actually

00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:53,780
sauerbraten is it's also the name of a

00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:56,160
first-person shooter developed by a

00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,530
developer with the nickname audible

00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,559
that's Dutch and literally translates to

00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:06,960
Earth Apple or more commonly known world

00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:11,550
in English is potato so it makes all

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:16,590
sense if you know this information okay

00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:18,420
um I believe it was two years ago that I

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:20,429
decided I want to change something about

00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:23,130
sew a button so button

00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:27,240
the engine was free that lip licensed

00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:32,309
but the content was partly free but

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:36,690
mostly uh non free it was one buck

00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:40,530
reporter who pointed me to free content

00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:43,380
which was assembled by Alan Sakai who

00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:47,460
works or worked for the Mozilla

00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:53,580
Foundation and who created a really cool

00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:55,890
project he compiled or I used the

00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:58,230
sauerbraten engine compiled to

00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,950
JavaScript of the M scripting through

00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,830
the descripton

00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,240
and you could run the game in the most

00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,730
saliva Prosser

00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,320
there's even a link maybe you can show

00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,389
it to you later

00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:14,820
you can play sauerbraten in your Mozilla

00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:17,369
browser it's yeah JavaScript and well he

00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,260
wanted to create a free game of course

00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:23,040
so we asked some of the developers if

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:26,129
they would realize since some of the

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,830
models and graphics and as I said some

00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:31,050
of them were already free and I

00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:34,050
discovered this package slightly

00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:36,720
modified it so that it worked with the

00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:43,980
cube 2 engine in Debian and we got cube

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:48,330
2 data only recently someone contacted

00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,310
me and filed the first back reports

00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:52,889
I mean upstream back reports because now

00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:55,139
I'm upstream developer basically it's

00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,869
I'm the absolute develop of cubes

00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,950
through data and he well he discovered

00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:04,589
some backs and we enabled some new game

00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:07,859
game game modifications he introduced

00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:10,560
some new files well and now you've

00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:13,109
basically started new project a free

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,260
project and it's it's just a demo game

00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:19,109
it's not complete but it's playable you

00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:24,210
can use it and you can use it freely to

00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:27,510
showcase Debian or Jan in a free player

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:29,940
the first person shooters general there

00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:33,390
are several websites dedicated to a free

00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,930
artwork one of them is open game rock

00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:43,710
and the other one is for example

00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:48,960
freesound.org example number two well

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:51,330
general general was also in contrib but

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,750
there was no content at all no game

00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:58,530
content at all so it was basically

00:35:53,750 --> 00:36:01,500
useless for game it general is a clone

00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:06,050
of Panzer General which is a game from

00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:08,369
the 90s developed by an American company

00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:11,220
which was very popular game it's

00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:14,670
classically classical a strategy game

00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:17,130
with hexagon fields and you could

00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:19,500
basically play

00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,060
well Germany and World War two and

00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,220
conquer the whole world

00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,710
the main objective was well if you were

00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,780
really good in this game you could

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:29,880
conquer washing yeah

00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,300
great that's the reason why it is still

00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:47,580
on the index in Germany no it's no joke

00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:49,620
so well okay well I am asked Steve

00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,900
mokuba who created our World War one

00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:58,800
modification if he would realize since

00:36:51,900 --> 00:37:00,480
his art part artwork and he did I could

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,310
reach him his email address was still

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:08,460
intact and still yeah well it basically

00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:11,490
converted all his graphics into format

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:14,190
which was compatible with the a general

00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:16,470
engine and here we are we have we have

00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,420
some content I didn't develop it I just

00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:21,990
asked another person if he would like to

00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,520
relay I since his work and most people

00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,590
are wearing it very generous when it

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:31,590
comes to this kind of question

00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:34,260
oh so we had another content package so

00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:39,900
how do we solve these non distributable

00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:45,810
problem we could as I said create our

00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:48,420
content or we create or we use a tool to

00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:51,210
download all these bad content non

00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,860
distributed and this tool is called game

00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,440
data package where the main drivers of

00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,540
Simon and Aleksandra

00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:03,230
it's basically a tool written in Python

00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:06,690
3 that scans the upstream data and

00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:10,700
creates creates hashes of each file so

00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:14,070
they are all identifiable and then

00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:16,440
downloads all the all the information

00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:20,300
all the the source files and creates a

00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:24,060
debian package but you as the user must

00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:27,450
accept the license so basically it's

00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:30,700
outside of Debian so the to the tool is

00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:37,690
free software but you must ensure

00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:40,530
that the license is okay for you it's it

00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,760
has very simple command-line interface

00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,130
basically nothing can go wrong you just

00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,990
type game data packager and the name of

00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,839
the game content you want to download

00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:55,480
and currently we support two hundred and

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:58,180
thirteen games and game variants non

00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,240
free well this is very easy and non free

00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:04,420
are all packages which are encumber

00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,589
encumbered by patents or other legal

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:11,339
issues that make their distribution

00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:11,339
problematic yes

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,240
yeah

00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:00,170
meet a package for for gamedata packager

00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:06,110
so the idea behind this game data

00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:09,610
packages well that you must that you can

00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:14,480
only let you create packages for your

00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:16,460
use for your users alone and I don't

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,950
intend to create a mate a package but

00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:21,770
everyone else is free to to create such

00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:24,320
a major package I'm personally not

00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,820
interested in it but of course yeah you

00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,820
can file wish list box reports against

00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:32,060
game data packager and request this

00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:34,430
feature or you can x-games yourself it

00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:38,810
is not very difficult game data package

00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:40,460
a uses EML files and contribution is

00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:43,480
really simple just check out the

00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:47,330
existing files and you can contribute

00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:53,930
new new games and of course you can also

00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:57,140
package something where no where no

00:40:53,930 --> 00:41:00,590
engine exists in Debian at the moment no

00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:03,170
problem I'm not sure if I have correctly

00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:06,680
answered the question but I maybe come

00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:09,970
back to this later yeah the most popular

00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,970
non free packages steam OH

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:19,340
because yeah as it has more than 5000

00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:23,530
installations that is more than 2 times

00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:26,480
of what the most popular free software

00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:29,480
game has on Debian

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:33,980
yeah why is it that all people talk

00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:37,610
about steam steam is a very big

00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:40,760
distribution platforms it has more than

00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:43,610
100 to 125 million registered accounts

00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,650
and there are more than 2000 native

00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:48,319
Linux games available

00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:52,910
proper Terry Enix games available but

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:55,819
also some games are completely free and

00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:59,510
they provide a means for free software

00:41:55,819 --> 00:42:05,109
developers to get some money so you can

00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:08,230
buy their game on the steam platform and

00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:12,890
they receive the money for it

00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:14,660
yeah well steam is it's not my kind of

00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:19,520
thing because I'm more interested in

00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:21,410
fixing packages from Maine because I

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,410
can't really fix anything in steam steam

00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:26,650
is completely it's a binary blob at the

00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:29,930
client and I can't do anything about it

00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:33,380
but I acknowledged that it is very

00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,880
important that people can play their

00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,569
favorite game there there's always a

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,670
time you want to play a specific game

00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:43,400
like it was World of Warcraft 7 years

00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:45,170
ago but I played it with wine I was

00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:49,039
probably the only one who played it with

00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:50,869
wine in my guilt but yeah there's there

00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,869
are times you want to play a specific

00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:57,260
game ok it's fair enough and in this

00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:59,839
regard steam is very helpful and it's

00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:03,770
better as steam as the people plays

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:07,190
Steam games on Debian or on Linux than

00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:13,069
on another operating system in my

00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:17,119
opinion ok I did you some key points

00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:20,630
about the Debian games team I joined the

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,180
team in 2012 my first experience was

00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:26,270
very unpleasant because nobody wanted to

00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:30,220
sponsor my packages or would review them

00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:33,020
and without help from outside without

00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:36,349
developers like Aria Anglo boots and

00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:42,770
Winston Cheng I would probably not stand

00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:44,299
here this really sucked but nowadays the

00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:47,960
situation is reversed

00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:51,079
I could sponsor packages but there are

00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,470
no people who want to want to contribute

00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:59,029
something that's why I am here

00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:59,660
yeah some stats you can see that in 2006

00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:03,020
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:06,039
2009 we had a lot of contributions on

00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,809
our mailing lists for discussions and

00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:11,539
they were equally distributed so we had

00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:14,390
some contributors and we are well it

00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:19,270
looks quite good then between 2010 and

00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:23,299
2011 you see one blue guy mr. Paul Weiss

00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:27,230
who contributes regularly on Devon devil

00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:31,369
games but the contributions declines

00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:41,030
over time and we are here now we need to

00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:43,970
change that please okay um well this is

00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:46,910
another graph from the package games to

00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:50,059
a list this is a buck mailing list and I

00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:56,240
started to reply to some back reports in

00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:59,150
2012 and here the purple graph that's

00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,160
about this this is game data packages

00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,730
basically Alex Wando who fights with

00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,130
listbox

00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:06,410
against a game data package but well

00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:09,980
yeah it increased a little bit we are

00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:13,670
better now in fixing bugs and we respond

00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:17,660
to bug reports and this is my chart

00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:21,529
which I have painted on my wall it's

00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:26,349
about bug fixes and well again it shows

00:45:21,529 --> 00:45:34,490
that we have approved a little overtime

00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:39,500
so yeah I've created another chart in

00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:41,720
this team statistics which displays the

00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,779
relation between how many maintenance

00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,400
are working for one package and mostly

00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:50,319
it's one do you know this graph

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:55,400
maintainers power package I've put the

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:57,529
link to into IOC room boo maybe now we

00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,500
can show it later but okay this is quite

00:45:57,529 --> 00:46:01,809
interesting and it should yeah maybe

00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,980
finish your talk and then I'll show you

00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:09,619
okay no I've never heard of it before

00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:11,839
last but not least ideas for future

00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:13,430
projects first of all it's not very

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,790
difficult to contribute something

00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:20,000
- Debian games first of all just play

00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:21,560
the games we walk about your experiences

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,900
that is very helpful

00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:28,040
report report bucks and fix them and

00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,780
what you also can do is help to improve

00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,940
desktop and app data files and icons

00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,950
it's very simple tasks but we need

00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,830
better icons you can we have some games

00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:39,800
with acne icons but this this is the

00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:42,230
first thing people will recognize and

00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,390
they decide hmm that's not Lea I can

00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:46,280
must be an ugly game so you can easily

00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:49,520
change that by providing a better icon

00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,920
very simple I have to maintain existing

00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:56,530
packages if you are already a Debian

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:59,420
maintainer we would like to welcome you

00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:01,550
we could also create data can games life

00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:05,270
project I have told I talked about that

00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,020
we form we could move plants dots Debian

00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:08,650
Ark to games

00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:11,750
Debian or can improve the web page and

00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:15,140
we could also create a game contents

00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:19,730
database I had in mind something similar

00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:22,400
to code search net but for artwork we

00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:24,770
already provides good copyright files in

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,850
many cases so it would be very easy to

00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:33,650
say okay I need a image about I don't

00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:35,690
know some some house or some texture and

00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,780
it should be created licensed under

00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:42,170
Creative Commons license this would be

00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:46,490
the perfect database it doesn't exist

00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:49,430
yet last but not least we could also

00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:52,370
create a promotional gaming video like

00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:54,700
it is very common in the gaming world

00:47:52,370 --> 00:48:00,260
where we just showcase in one minute

00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:02,870
what games we have and what what cool

00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,940
games we have and yeah why you should

00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:07,400
play them that would be really cool so

00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,520
that's it for my side and thank you for

00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,520
listening

00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:17,140
[Applause]

00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:26,400
whoever is interested later on when when

00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:28,950
we leave the show here there is

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,070
currently a project based on the famous

00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:34,830
open Pandora a successor called the

00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:38,070
Pyrrha and fortunately I was able to

00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:43,440
bring a prototype here it's a gaming

00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:46,530
console based on Debian stretch so it's

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,680
quite a nice thing that there exists

00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:51,869
such a thing and you can look at it I

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,619
have it here it runs currently frozen

00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:57,780
bathrooms and yeah I put it on my desk

00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:00,210
and everybody who likes can see it and

00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:04,440
touch it and play with it I'm not

00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:13,770
related to the project itself yeah yeah

00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:18,660
we can show to the camera maybe is it on

00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:24,359
the camera now very quick too high too

00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:26,670
low okay it's not open hardware

00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:29,700
unfortunately because the license is not

00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:33,020
completely free so as far as I know you

00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:36,540
get all the schematics and PCB and so on

00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:38,670
but it's not let's say open hardware

00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,349
license or something at least for

00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:43,020
software developers that's quite okay

00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:44,940
because you know all their pin

00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:48,619
connections and so on everybody kernel

00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:53,190
hacker or device driver needs to know

00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:57,140
but it's a non-commercial something so

00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,140
not really open hardware No

00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:05,960
I might perhaps show the graph by

00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:08,380
quickly here what's what this graph

00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,180
shows is a version control system

00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,490
contribution of maintenance and about

00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:15,710
200 packages are only touched by a

00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:19,520
single person in decay via in theory I

00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:22,130
mean games team about 130 packages are

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,310
touched by two persons and so on so you

00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:28,820
have this kind of hyperbolic graph and

00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:30,830
it's similar in Debian made team a

00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,200
little bit better but it should be like

00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:35,780
in the pro team where you have kind of

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,060
that graph so you have a minimum of

00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:40,040
packages only by maintained by one it

00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:42,850
should be the goal that would be optimal

00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,850
yeah I agree

00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,850
meet a discussion pattern does it show

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,100
the people are really maintaining the

00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:58,580
package or the ones that are mentioned

00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:01,430
in the control file no this is our real

00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:04,910
commits it our commits and I strike out

00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:07,700
or commits below 5 so it's random

00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:10,340
commits but the the real question you

00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:12,560
should ask is does it has a time scale

00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:16,010
because in Debian if we have a better

00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:18,440
distribution of to maintain us but the

00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:21,260
effect in fact they it's a package some

00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:24,080
built by somebody else and took takeover

00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:27,860
by me so it's also a single maintained

00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:29,810
package so but yeah in in the purple

00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:33,890
team you see where it should should go

00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:35,300
and we should have four eyes principle

00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:44,060
four packages and this is definitely

00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:46,700
note for as principle okay yeah thank

00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:51,010
you all for your attention and that's it

00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:51,010
for the Debian games talk see you around

00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,320
