so the next talk is by all of what on

00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:17,980
hacking were cats up GAID welcome

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:23,029
[Applause]

00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:26,900
as test hello hello everyone good to be

00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:29,300
here again as is anyone in the room who

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:34,040
wasn't here yesterday on our technical

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:36,309
talk okay i-i'll do a quick recap of who

00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,309
we are

00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:48,140
okay second okay a circuit is a mobile

00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:49,790
too difficult telecommunications or

00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,309
actually a telecommunications provider

00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:56,360
in based in Germany in dÃ¼sseldorf

00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:59,659
we have business in Germany and UK so we

00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,809
also we also we offer voice over IP

00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:05,360
phone services and also mobile phone

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:07,130
services and API is for real-time

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,790
communication manipulation you can have

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,500
inbound API is up on top ice do all sort

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,979
of things you would like to do what

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,780
would like to do two phone calls this is

00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,380
actually the site we also yet also so

00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,650
yesterday

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,960
so what we're actually doing and this is

00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:26,060
probably half the truth because we've

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,320
been there a bit longer than you might

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,010
expect

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,890
actually we started in 1998 or two

00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:37,670
founders started a website named beta

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,500
Cthulhu for neon day which was one of

00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,230
the first I think one of the first

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,290
comparison websites in Germany when the

00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,610
phone market was liberated and that gave

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,240
you the option to find the cheapest

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,520
phone provider to place your next call

00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,550
also choose the cheapest phone provider

00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,470
for your home line two three years later

00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:00,920
we had a very good idea to buy one of

00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:03,049
the rather short top-level domain and

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,080
actually rather short domain which was

00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:08,629
SMS dot de and that was a service which

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,549
ran until two years ago I think and that

00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:14,269
gave users the option to send text

00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:17,360
messages for free to existing phone

00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:20,220
numbers of other people with a short

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,280
piece of advertisement at the end and

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,170
at a later point we also started to have

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,910
a paid option where you could just top

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,040
up your credit and send SMS without

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:33,750
advertisement in it 2004 we had a with

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,750
among others before we had one idea to

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,630
do something with sip and voice over P

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,020
and phone stuff and as you may have

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:47,700
figured this as has now become our main

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:49,440
main source of well income I guess we

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,270
started with a sip gate basic this is

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,700
this was our private private customer

00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,410
product back then which still exists it

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,360
offers you a free landline phone number

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,270
and can place calls for free to other

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,930
sip gate customers and you can top it up

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,400
with credit and call regular numbers in

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,720
whatever destination you might want to

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,400
call and of course you can receive calls

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,070
but later we decided to do the same

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,290
thing but in professional on a

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,200
professional level for business customer

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,590
customers which means virtual PBX or

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,620
hosted PBX which means we host whatever

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,330
PBX systems or whatever you would expect

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,370
from a PBX and you only have the IP

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,940
phones in your office or home office or

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:40,110
wherever so this product is named SEC a

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,180
team and this is this is actually this

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,530
was a breaking change and how our

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,250
company worked because after then we

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:50,670
just well worked and programmed and did

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,410
stuff and we kind of locked ourself into

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,980
the basement or at least a part of the

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,930
company to design and develop this team

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,450
platform which probably took I think

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,250
three years but at the same time our

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,530
private customer product which was to

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,720
create basic or is a good basic kind of

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,600
exploding customer numbers and we had

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,530
like six six digit customer figures to

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,900
deal with and that was tough hard and by

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,140
the time this team product was launched

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,940
our two founders said well this was a

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,109
nice attempt but we won't probably be

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,140
able to do that again

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:27,470
so if it fails and luckily CPA team

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,789
didn't fail it's actually doing the main

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,480
thing that drives our company as of

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:34,580
today but if

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,710
if that would have failed it would be

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:40,070
within three years of development for

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,230
nothing and we know that we have to do

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,600
to come up with new products on a

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,340
regular basis to find the new circuit

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,440
team for whatever the next ten or twenty

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,390
or twenty years and that wouldn't work

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,130
if you would if you would have to well

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,330
lock in ourself no basement for three

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,750
years and hope that whatever comes out

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:59,350
would be accepted by the market so this

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,540
is where we started with scrum back then

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,690
for development and we are our bosses

00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,580
just said well we'll we'll do swam we do

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,880
run by the book which means we don't

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:15,500
adapt scrum to whatever we want or we we

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,060
try to find out processes that will work

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,160
for us we just figure out that it was

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:24,140
the best way to just do it as its

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:26,120
intended to be done and that's that's

00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,910
where this story actually start starts

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,740
and a couple of years ago two or three

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,170
years ago we wrote a lot of small

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:37,820
published a small book we have a few

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:41,690
copies here and this book actually kind

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,690
of tries to cover all those many of

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:48,170
those aspects we have changed or tried

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:50,930
out since that year since 2009 2010 on

00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,060
our probably agile journey as others

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,470
would probably would put it on a

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,470
marketing slide or something like that

00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:00,080
and I try to give you some insights on

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,080
these and to make it not as boring I try

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,460
to whenever we talk about a chapter we

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,870
try to do some kind of interactive

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:12,220
feedback after that see if you have any

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:15,890
questions so today we're around 170

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:19,070
employees or when we started with the

00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:23,960
with that 2009 we were around 60 I think

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:27,830
and all of those one at an a380

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,860
employees today there's probably 40 to

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:34,910
50 tech people like software engineers

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:41,300
system engineers and the rest is back

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:42,740
office legal customer service etc as you

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,960
can see here we have our one of our

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,750
employees also is he's he's an artist

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,270
and he

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:53,130
for one thing he does is he's drawing

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:57,690
each each employee but he's all he also

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:59,190
takes care of figuring out what art to

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:06,930
put in the wards and the office because

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:08,880
we have lots of that so as I said scrum

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,910
was the way to go back in 2010 for

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,670
software development as good as there

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,710
was for the software developers that was

00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,320
a huge problem for the rest because for

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,590
example I was I've been with circuit

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,170
since 2012 so I joined slightly after

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:27,330
after the transformation since all those

00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,520
software development teams got pretty

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,940
fast

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:35,280
that actually made clear that the admin

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,320
guys are pretty slow and too slow to

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,169
deliver anything that's useful to those

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,270
of the development teams so we had to

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:45,990
figure out something that makes us all

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:47,850
so fast or faster scrum wasn't a good

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,470
option and our opinion because if you

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,650
want to do if you do system maintenance

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,970
and set up servers and databases and

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:59,250
whatever whatnot scrum with its

00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,830
predefined sprints for example two-week

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,130
or three weeks or four weeks it's it's

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:08,280
probably to to static to react to

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,960
important things for example if we need

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,780
a new database we probably can tell our

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,790
customers well sure but it'll take two

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,370
weeks because we have our sprint already

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,620
planned or if one of our colleagues as

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,540
well my screen broke on my laptop rock

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,910
and I probably it's not a good idea to

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,580
time that yeah well I I'll plan to buy

00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:29,610
your new screen in the next print so

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:33,930
that's why we came up with a Kanban does

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,430
anyone know Kanban yes the good thing

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,919
about kemon is it's it's not like a

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,860
process like scrum or actually change

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,380
the entire way you work or think kemon

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,850
actually is it's about visualizing what

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:50,850
you're always doing and then figuring

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:52,080
out where to get better all those

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,360
pictures are actually from our office

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,730
and that at least there's one proof I'm

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,260
in the picture but they're these are not

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,300
stock photos so the

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,610
main rule for combat is that where you

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,460
are don't try to don't try to figure out

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,790
well what what you do when you work

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,290
after or with kanmon just start where

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,260
you are for example to visualize the

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:17,650
processes you have or visualize workflow

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:20,200
just use a whiteboard and stickies and

00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:22,780
whatever and try to see where you get

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,340
stuck where you wait what if you have to

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:31,600
wait for external resources or whatever

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:33,880
it does take to get your job done limit

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,700
your work in progress don't do like 50

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,850
jobs at the same time for example if

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,890
someone requests a server try to to

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,650
handle that request until it's finished

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,080
because if you like by the server but

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,660
you stop doing that and help someone

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,670
else and you don't wreck the server the

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,320
guy who wanted to sever he doesn't get

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,720
anything out of that if you tell them

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,300
well it's it's there it's it's here but

00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,860
doesn't it that's of no help for him so

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,220
limit your work in progress and try to

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,080
finish your what you've started either

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,210
finish it to a point at help someone or

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,560
all just said well that this has failed

00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:13,270
for some reason and you need to improve

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:16,450
there I'm slightly ahead of my slides

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:21,520
yeah measure and improve so look where

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:25,680
you get stuck for example you can use we

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,680
use lots of those magnetic stripes -

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:33,310
yeah from tables or some sort of columns

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,680
on your own whiteboards to visualize

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:37,900
where where we are in a pro in a certain

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,460
process and which kind of tasks have got

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,430
all been finished and which are waiting

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:46,330
on whom and this is actually something

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:49,060
that really spun of the speed in our

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:53,320
operations operations team and helped

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:55,360
this sorry and helped us to to to adapt

00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,310
to the speed the scrum teams had already

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,380
picked up and that that made the admin

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,860
team less of an annoyance to them I hope

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,860
I think

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,420
does anyone know the concept of light

00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:15,660
levels within conmen it's probably not

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:23,250
as known this is a term I think it has

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:28,220
been coined by a guy named got the name

00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,220
sorry I'll look it up later well anyways

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:34,740
you can actually play the combined game

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,840
on different levels and the first flight

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,340
level is for example managing work in

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,580
your team so this is what we did we just

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:45,900
try to optimize how our team worked

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:48,150
internally the next light level would be

00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,370
if you have someone managing multiple

00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,680
teams and if he would use Kanban to

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,660
organize the work they do it's not it's

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,390
like more of managing that the people

00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,810
know to work and flight level 3 is

00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:03,000
actually if you cut it does Kanban on a

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,470
some sort of company level and for

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,200
example for products so you have like

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,180
you know the head of your company and

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,700
whoever's responsible for products if

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,250
they use Kanban to visualize what kind

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,740
of Pro what kind of what kind of

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,810
products we have in which stage are they

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,000
is is there some product maybe

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,890
unmaintained and who's working on what

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,340
and what is the next thing that is going

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,690
to happen there and the same the same

00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,520
principles apply here you want to

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,610
probably limit your work in progress for

00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,860
example don't do 18 changes it's the

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,870
same time to you to that one product and

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,140
probably be probably not going to finish

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:43,500
one of them so just focus on on one task

00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:47,160
for the product but this is what we call

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:52,980
flat levels well and it's pull not push

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:56,880
it means if your honor if you work on a

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,190
Kanban but you always pull something for

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:04,320
example you pull the next story or in

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:06,240
the next whatever your work whatever

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,180
whatever way you use to organize you you

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,010
work there and you always pull you don't

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,890
push or you don't have someone like its

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,190
place a story or something in your work

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,190
in progress

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:33,720
column sorry any questions about Kanban

00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:35,820
so far okay so the next level was as I

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,960
said we had those scrum teams which

00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:42,540
usually consists of a scrum master a

00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,240
product owner and a bunch of developers

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,120
and after a while I said well that's

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,680
that's we're already faster and we were

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,950
shipping after two weeks of scrum our

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,870
office office print but a lot of times

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,550
our hours print fail because we have to

00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,120
wait for someone for example we have a

00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:03,930
UX team who helped with the design or

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:09,530
texting whatever or we have the admin

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:11,550
guys or whatever other teams we have and

00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,620
for example I said we have bad

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,080
communication with the customer support

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,940
so we get only slow or bad feedback from

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,730
customers about the changes we have

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:24,450
shipped so that's when we started to to

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:26,910
redesign this a bit and we implemented

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:35,430
cross-functional teams which means we

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:38,070
kind of removed our static former teams

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:41,520
and had at each team grouped around the

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,260
product and they had all the worlds and

00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,880
the team to work on that product for

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,660
some of that customer support

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,780
they had developers there do experts

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:55,500
textures and we just had to find the

00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,390
right balance between who to put in the

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,880
team and who not for example you also

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,860
need a lawyer if you for example need to

00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,550
update the Terms of Service for the

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:09,000
product but it's probably a bit bit much

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:12,750
to hire 17 lawyers and have them in each

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,430
team and sitting around and doing not

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,230
that much so we need to find a balance

00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,210
between who to who to put in a

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,000
cross-functional team and who not

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:24,990
and there's also another problem if you

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,210
have if you had the dedicated teams for

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:30,810
graphics dedicated teams for developers

00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,779
and you tear them apart and have product

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:36,040
teams

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:37,899
how do those those people of the same

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,339
role actually communicate with each

00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:41,290
other so you have like whole bunch of

00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,939
developers who used to work together and

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,279
now they work in separate teams or a

00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:46,810
whole bunch of designers which we used

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,529
to work together and optimize the work

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:54,250
and their opinions and now they are

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:56,199
split over many teams and this is where

00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,509
we came up with communities and we have

00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:01,959
like a developer community admin

00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:06,129
community and also UX communities and

00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:08,620
others and these are just regular

00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:10,209
meetings for example once in two weeks I

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,779
think from for most of those Oh actually

00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:16,029
I should somehow once a week wear

00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:18,579
whatever he's interested in that topic

00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:20,259
just comes together for a quick meeting

00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:21,970
sometimes five minutes sometimes it's a

00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:27,639
half an hour and this is where actually

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:30,819
people can can can talk about issues

00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:33,189
like for example if if one team intends

00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:35,529
to write a new service new back-end

00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:37,420
service and wants to use for example

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:40,569
Python which has not been announced X so

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,220
far so this is a good place to talk with

00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:44,379
the other developers if there would be

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:49,569
good idea of their reasons to use

00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:51,879
something else the same applies to the

00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:53,860
admin team or the the UX communities

00:16:51,879 --> 00:17:01,059
where it's all about communication and

00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:05,620
having finding a you unified strategy

00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:07,179
for example questions about this so far

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,860
and this is actually the way it still

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:11,579
works so all the teams are grouped

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,579
around products

00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,290
this is something that can be perceived

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,760
in both ways it doesn't mean we don't do

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,990
trainings it just means we don't have a

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:33,940
budget limit on that couple of years ago

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:35,080
we decided to the question was if we

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:40,260
don't have a limit or we don't have a

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,260
budget that there is no known only mmit

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,640
the thing is we just said well from from

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:52,390
now on we expect that each employee

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:55,390
finds at least two two means of training

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,730
per year for himself so means of

00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:00,810
training could be attend to the training

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:03,340
or a workshop or a tender conference

00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,470
whatever comes into your mind that that

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,590
helps you do your job better and it's up

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:13,210
to you to to find it and to take care of

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:17,290
well not getting there but organize it

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,430
and if you decide to go somewhere you

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,000
actually just need to follow a few steps

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,530
for example let someone know that that

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,470
it has to be booked for you talk to your

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:28,630
team and check if or if not everyone

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,940
that leaves at the same time or figure

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:33,670
out if that actually helps with what

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,670
your day business is and probably find

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,110
other people who want to go with you and

00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:40,600
we also have this giant whiteboard

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,800
somewhere in the company at a problem

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,600
from a place where there's where there

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,440
are little magnets with the with

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,450
everyone's had a name and whenever you

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,030
book a conference or the training you

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,670
just note where you're going so everyone

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,130
can see where you go and probably decide

00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,200
to go there as well and you also can

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,050
easily spot people who don't go to

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,000
conferences and tell them or ask them to

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:09,520
maybe join you if you know something

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,970
that might be of help them and we

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:16,450
started that I think four or five years

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,020
ago and this has been very good for

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:22,030
everyone

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:24,280
and what from a back office point of

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:27,580
view or

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,530
they're actually from what I've from

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,620
what I've heard that there is a there is

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,090
a budget but they just guesstimated it

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,720
for the first year and for well if

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,090
people just follow the order to just

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,010
find conference and whatever and we

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,500
think we might end up with this some and

00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,660
for some reason they they released that

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,680
what what has it been told they they

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:54,100
just managed to it almost the the budget

00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,480
but they wouldn't have stopped it if we

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,520
would have gone over budget at that

00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,700
point so at least that what more people

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,550
tell that's what people say but again

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,550
this in has been one of the best things

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:09,070
or a lot of decisions we took in the

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:12,340
last year's and I don't think we will

00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:15,790
change that very quickly or very soon at

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,920
all and I can only recommend it every

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:22,930
once in a while there the the discussion

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:26,080
spawns because sometimes people attend

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:30,010
conferences my eyes are going to try the

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,690
from different angle we always say well

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,270
people have to take care of their

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,520
decisions and we trust them to take the

00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:41,080
right decision for example if a certain

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,690
conference takes place in New York and

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:47,500
the same conference also takes place in

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:49,930
Cologne you probably you should be

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,970
should be old enough to decide that

00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,610
visiting Cologne is maybe better for

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,430
everyone although New York for sure is a

00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:59,260
nice city but it's probably cheaper and

00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:00,730
better to visit the same conference in

00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,460
Cologne unless there's a very good

00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,620
reason and we just trust everyone to

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,390
take the right decision and not pick the

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:13,420
one in New York unless there's a good

00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:16,270
reason and sometimes sometimes they

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,860
disgust spawn for example using internal

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:21,760
communications - like Yammer or it's

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:25,210
just talking to people that you did you

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,860
meet somewhere why is worried someone

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,840
wants to go somewhere because other

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:32,830
people sing I think that it's probably a

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:35,090
bit far away from his area of work or

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:38,600
whatever and

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:41,540
all this this leads to so it kind of

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:45,170
levels itself out so there there's

00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:55,480
there's no abuse of this offer or

00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:58,460
feature at all questions about this okay

00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,130
this is also something we've done for a

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:04,850
while we call it open open Friday

00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:09,620
because it's every other Friday but it's

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:12,680
generally just known as unconferences or

00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:17,960
bark games anyone not not familiar with

00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:20,120
the term backhand or unconference so

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,270
what basically happens is every other

00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,980
Friday which is the end of the of the

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:31,160
scrum sprint at least for whatever works

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:34,670
after scrum we meet the whole company

00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,890
meets in the morning at 10:00 sorry

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,410
before kickoff and we have this

00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:43,540
whiteboard which just names a bunch of

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:46,670
rooms and has a time schedule on it and

00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:51,110
you're free to put up any kind of

00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:53,870
session which where you assume that it

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:58,280
might help you the company or colleagues

00:22:53,870 --> 00:23:01,160
to for example get the work done better

00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,880
or might also be for entertainment we

00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:09,140
have seen sessions about knitting and

00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:12,350
how to actually pack a parachute

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:16,840
I don't know well that was actually fun

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,920
but this for example also a way to

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,450
communicate things you have learned on a

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:24,410
conference for example if you went to a

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,850
conference this is a good good place to

00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,650
share something you learned or you

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,610
wanted to try out with other people and

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:34,820
there's just some rules and one law and

00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:37,240
the four rules of the open Friday or for

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,670
example I guess those apply to most

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,710
unconferences is whoever comes are the

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,110
right people which means you're not

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,430
allowed to invite somebody it's not like

00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,399
it's not a meeting you cannot force

00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,179
someone to attend

00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:53,820
meeting and vice-versa you you cannot

00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,769
throw someone out someone thinks he has

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,229
something to say or add to this topic

00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,879
well he's generally welcome and it

00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:02,279
starts when it starts and it's over

00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:07,289
that's over that means that well you

00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:09,299
actually do have a timetable and but if

00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:12,330
you put up a slot for example or a

00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:15,479
session says learning from joy Inc which

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:17,279
is a book and after 10 minutes talking

00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:19,049
about this book the the discussion

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,539
shifts to some other book which is

00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:23,549
probably interesting for some reason you

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,899
can't just stand up and say well the

00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:26,460
session was about this book and I want

00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:30,139
to talk about this book because it just

00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,700
happens it whatever happens this is also

00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:35,269
quite for through whatever happens is

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,460
beyond hey it could have happened and

00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:41,009
well if you're after 45 minutes of your

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,589
session if it's still a hot topic and

00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:44,969
everyone is discussing you have to leave

00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:46,950
the room because there's probably next

00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:49,379
session but you can just continue

00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:52,440
somewhere else so there there are no

00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:54,599
strict rules and the law of the two feet

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,249
is very important if you feel that you

00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:58,169
cannot add anything to the session

00:24:56,249 --> 00:25:00,659
anymore you're free to go just stand up

00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:02,909
and leave and nobody can tell well this

00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:05,940
is not finished please stay seated it's

00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:08,789
just you're free to do whatever you want

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,349
and especially sometimes we have the

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:11,789
external visitors and they always get

00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:13,859
confused when people just stand up and

00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:15,389
leave in the middle of the session and

00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:18,269
it's like is she coming back

00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:19,649
mmm I don't know I guess I guess not he

00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:21,719
said whatever you wanted to say and

00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:24,690
heard what he wanted to hear and he left

00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:26,759
or she and this is something that

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:30,919
started initially just with our

00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:34,830
developers because in in scrum there's

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:38,879
it's called NDS which is not a misprint

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:41,279
or after the Sprint which is like a it's

00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:44,399
the last day of your two weeks or

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,109
whatever length sprint and this was it

00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:49,649
originally it's it's a time where

00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:51,299
developers can which developers can

00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:54,149
dedicate to for example improve their

00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,919
workplace setting noobs reset up their

00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:59,579
their workstation read a book or

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,929
whatever and this is how it started and

00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:01,200
from there just evolved and at some

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:03,450
point

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,720
we decided to let the whole company take

00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:08,899
part in that and not just developers and

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,880
this actually replaced a lot of meetings

00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:15,350
which we had or an annoyed people

00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,980
because you were just able to to

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:21,840
transform it into a session and

00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,190
sometimes actually if you make a meeting

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,700
and you invite people you probably

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,950
invite 50% who are not interested and

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,470
you leave out the 50% that were actually

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,049
important for a certain decision but

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:37,649
they didn't know so that way you can

00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:39,000
actually end up with very important

00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:41,549
input from people you just didn't think

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,419
of the first place so this is something

00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:46,980
I can highly recommend and you know we

00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,120
have put them put together some more

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,480
information about this on the website

00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,519
open Friday talk so if you want to try

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,690
it out or convince your boss that area

00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:58,470
that you should try it out this is

00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:08,730
probably something that helps questions

00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:12,510
about this is the minimum number of

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:14,429
people who should attend or like minimum

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,880
size of company where it makes sense and

00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:19,799
or do you really need five tracks or is

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,149
one enough or do you think it's really

00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:27,240
useful if there's more than one option

00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:29,549
really to go well sometimes we have an

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,950
open Friday and although many people are

00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:37,289
there there's like three three sessions

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:38,789
and sometimes people will stand stand

00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,950
around disappointed because they had to

00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:43,559
well that they were too late in the line

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,179
and their session will kind of drop

00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:48,480
because there weren't enough was enough

00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:53,460
room and I think you can start with

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:57,600
maybe like 8 or 10 people probably won't

00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:02,580
record at most - and we started with us

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:06,779
and I think for 2025 and right now the

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:09,210
only group are all of super grambler

00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:11,580
issues who is not a hundred percent of

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:14,279
of this customer support because they

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,090
just can't leave the phones at least not

00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:16,710
everyone

00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,679
so that they tried to take part in it

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:23,399
but due to their job they they can't

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,899
always at least entirely take part but

00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:30,289
other than that everyone is welcomed

00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:32,340
everyone is at least it is at least

00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:34,200
supposed to be at the kickoff meeting

00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,570
you don't have to go anyway you can just

00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:42,679
do anything on that day that besides

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:45,029
leave but it's very very well accepted

00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,529
and I think the the website also has

00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:57,690
some information about minimum numbers

00:28:46,529 --> 00:29:02,580
and stuff this is something people are

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:05,460
usually surprised for one that we

00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,549
actually have a maximum worked time

00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,669
limit per week and the other thing that

00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:13,710
usually surprised people is that we use

00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:18,330
what we call those machines in English

00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:22,110
the the like a punch card system thing

00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:24,360
where so whenever someone comes the

00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:28,019
office he has to check in and when he

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,690
leaves he has to check out and we

00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:36,119
actually do force people to only work 40

00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:37,710
hours a week well only depending on how

00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,619
you look at that from the public sector

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:43,529
that's what we use to less but this is

00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:47,129
how our limit and it's it's especially

00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:51,029
about not doing any overtime so if there

00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:53,309
is a problem and if you need to do some

00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:58,470
overtime today or tomorrow whatever

00:29:53,309 --> 00:30:00,929
that's okay but you need to to flat that

00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:03,990
out during the month or within the next

00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:06,330
weeks and it's always also okay to force

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:10,320
Apple stores like eight hours overtime

00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:12,149
on your account but if this gets too

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,759
much you will first of all you will get

00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:16,830
a nice and friendly reminder email to to

00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,419
lower your overtime and if this sudden

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:22,850
doesn't have your team will get this

00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:26,700
mail to check what's going on there and

00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:28,860
that's actually something that had some

00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,880
attention recently recently when the

00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:37,049
who decided to to make this kind of

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,690
accounting system mandatory and that was

00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:42,809
actually a Spiegel Online picked this up

00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,610
for some reason or for a good reason and

00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:47,370
they hadn't that they published an

00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,720
article about us based on this thing

00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,070
which is actually something that should

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,940
everyone have I guess because whenever

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:56,309
you do or in Germany we say fat hounds

00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,280
about site which is a nice word to

00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:01,799
describe that the company trusts you to

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,350
not do overtime and whatever you do that

00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:07,410
usually people do overtime for various

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:09,960
reasons and this is the only way to not

00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,910
do overtime I guess and this is a tool

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,830
that also that either helps that helps

00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,860
me to not to over time because I am

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:19,350
confronted with my time balance every

00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:22,500
day and while the company is the same

00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:26,040
and what we're not trying as you are

00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:30,179
always free to to do to have like below

00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:40,169
zero balance for a while and which is

00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:41,070
not too much transparency is also a huge

00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:44,250
thing

00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:46,049
it's a Couture important thing in in two

00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:49,200
ways we have we have a team that's

00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:52,620
dedicated to to do all things with well

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:57,510
numbers and figures and stuff and they

00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:59,790
collect whatever numbers are there to

00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,700
collect and you're free to to always

00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:04,200
consult them and they provide a monthly

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,610
company report which contains all the

00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,380
facts and figures about all of our

00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,780
products and there's nothing that's

00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,200
missing so and this is available to all

00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:16,110
employees so everyone is this is able to

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,549
to see how well a certain product is

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,570
doing at any time and how well it was

00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:24,650
doing two years or five years ago and

00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:27,809
there's everything is in there except

00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:30,510
salaries but we have solved that problem

00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:33,570
as well but that's a different story

00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:37,559
the other thing with transparency is

00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:39,450
transparencies this looks a rather

00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:42,360
confusing I know but this is actually

00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,730
this is the combat flight level

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:51,390
thing I was talking earlier so we have

00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:53,760
this huge pile of stickies it's it's in

00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:56,730
a public place and this although it

00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,600
looks rather confusing on a picture this

00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:04,679
is actually those two bots are actually

00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:08,669
one and the other one as well and all

00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:13,740
those lines are teams that work with

00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:16,980
sepia the left part is is non product

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,250
team so like back off his in-house IT

00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,929
stuff and the one on the right are

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:25,620
almost every every team on the right is

00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:28,950
connected to a certain product and we

00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:31,620
meet once a week with with one person

00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:35,510
from all of these teams to do a giant

00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:38,039
stand-up thing and within 20 minutes

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,960
everyone gets a short update watch eat

00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:41,760
what each team is actually doing right

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,309
now and what's what's the current task

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,549
and what's the next task not as a

00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:49,049
low-level report what is every emperor

00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:50,789
we're doing but what is what's the team

00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:54,269
working only what's the team currently

00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:56,669
working on and there are also lots of

00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:58,230
magnets with faces on them because you

00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:01,159
can you can always check who is actually

00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:04,409
currently engaged in this team and if

00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,000
the at this point of time where this

00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,429
slot will also be discussed if for

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,589
example a team needs more people and if

00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:12,270
someone says well we do have some spare

00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:14,099
people because we finished this one job

00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:16,800
and now we have for example three

00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:18,450
back-end developers which have nothing

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,790
to do because our nets next task is

00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:23,339
something with front-end or whatever so

00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:28,970
this is this is also the point where you

00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:28,970
can shift work work force

00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:45,680
do you know the term extreme programming

00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:47,810
more programming and this is also

00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:51,590
something we have picked up for us a

00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,780
while ago and if you see someone working

00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:57,160
alone at SAP gate this is usually a bad

00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:00,020
sign and will be frowned upon if you sit

00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,750
alone at your screen with headphones on

00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:07,550
because usually we always do things at

00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:09,050
least in pairs sometimes even more that

00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,770
depends on the type of work for example

00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:15,380
if you're just doing regular work in us

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,030
print you something like it you fix the

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,660
pack whatever you will do it this at

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,340
least in a pair of two if you work on

00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,800
something that's probably new or that's

00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,720
a system that's that has rare

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,370
interaction and there's only like three

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,220
people who have deals with that system

00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:33,160
many decades ago then we'll probably see

00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,230
something like this or even more so

00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,150
which always means that the guy was the

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,100
least or the woman with the least

00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,480
knowledge will be the one typing and the

00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,830
one with the most knowledge will be

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,720
fairest away and just give hints and

00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:49,400
this usually leads to too wide wider

00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,470
spread of knowledge above especially

00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:56,000
about things that are rarely touched for

00:35:51,470 --> 00:36:02,240
whatever reason this was first adopted

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:05,930
by our developers but that also is used

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,670
in system administration even back

00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:14,450
office in the back office for example if

00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:16,670
they do critical transactional transact

00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,050
transactions or whatever something

00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:23,110
that's complicated they usually do that

00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:25,430
in pairs to to spread the knowledge I

00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:29,000
think probably everyone does it except

00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:31,370
the kitchen I guess that's probably not

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:38,120
a good thing there or at least not

00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:40,280
everything when we started with scrum

00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,200
well what you usually do is you you need

00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,730
you need scrum masters but if you want

00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,710
to try something something new you don't

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,750
hire like five scrum muscles just to

00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,220
figure out if scrum works for you so we

00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,200
did the same everyone does we just

00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,730
started with

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,550
asking people if they would change their

00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:58,200
role and viewed it and none of them is

00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,060
Grandmaster anymore they all went back

00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,890
to a former role and our developers or

00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:08,310
system engineers again and but it

00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:11,250
doesn't work without so we have a team

00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:19,230
of scrum master so actually a dry

00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:21,540
coaches who work with the teams to let

00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:26,310
them know how things work to take care

00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:29,130
of process each scrum or Kanban to

00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:31,260
remember to remind them of limited work

00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,690
in progress or don't overextend your

00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,870
stand up and whatever else is needed and

00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,970
they also facilitate retrospectives

00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:41,360
which is actually one aspect of scrum

00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:44,850
and I think it's the most important one

00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:47,340
because the retrospective means that at

00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:50,370
the end of each sprint and scrum you're

00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:53,550
supposed to do a retrospective taking a

00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:56,070
look at the past sprint that just

00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:59,240
happened and you need to figure out

00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:01,890
things that for example stopped you from

00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,870
finishing the successfully the the

00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,400
sprint for example story some some

00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:08,250
things failed and you weren't able to

00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,080
finish that and this is an this is the

00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:13,170
point to talk about that beat for

00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:17,400
example slow hardware or bad planning or

00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:19,950
whatever else and this is about

00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,740
technical stuff but also about social

00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:24,960
problems that might arise in a team for

00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,600
example someone listening to someone

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,190
having a bad taste of music and slowing

00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,020
down the development process by that or

00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:36,210
whatever and this is something that's

00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:38,040
mandatory for each and every team at

00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,830
save gate so this is not something only

00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,420
scrum teams do even the kitchen has a

00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:45,030
retrospective every two weeks and

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,070
everyone else as well and they are

00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:49,980
usually facilitated by our HR coaches

00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:54,780
and as they have a lot of to do and we

00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:58,080
don't have too many of them teams that

00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,640
have been like in the same constellation

00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,110
for a while they usually do them on

00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,480
their own because they're there by now

00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:12,349
they are fit enough to to handle that

00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:14,940
or sometimes people opt in as moderators

00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:20,039
English I don't know

00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:22,170
as facilitators and help out but again

00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,990
this is probably the most important

00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:27,960
aspect of this because if you if you're

00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:31,079
not if you're not with respect and look

00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,430
at the past weeks you will never get

00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,369
better and this is something that keeps

00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:41,279
you in a continuous loop of getting

00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:46,890
better at whatever things this is the

00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:53,180
book I mentioned earlier and I I have

00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:56,720
some with me we do a quick raffle see oh

00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,720
just a second

00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:06,809
that's too many windows here so since

00:40:04,829 --> 00:40:16,319
we're at the Debian conference I'll try

00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:18,299
to to ask a quick dip in question which

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,599
I did not prepare at all I just have to

00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,599
find it

00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:34,140
hmm okay so they have been at least two

00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:40,470
or maybe more they've been product

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:46,099
leader named Ian Ian sorry I and Ian how

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:50,089
many years yeah we're people named Ian

00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:50,089
product leader in total

00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:00,260
hmm so missing a correct answer yeah

00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:18,360
okay I base my information on Wikipedia

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:21,780
after at best get something else

00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:24,270
where was the first minute error the

00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,780
first Devcon tree in 2000 well that was

00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:32,280
fast

00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:50,850
so English or German but I have more not

00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:57,120
not not many but I have some yeah so one

00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:59,280
question yeah I forgot the question so I

00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,310
was the implementation tonight

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:07,230
okay it was it like snap and

00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:09,830
implementing or how how was how did it

00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:12,810
go to that point well we we didn't

00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:14,970
entirely do that on our own we we got uh

00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:20,040
some help from an from a company in

00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:22,800
Berlin but in the end we it was kind of

00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,240
like a snap thing because our bosses

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,010
just said well that that's the only way

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,400
we can survive and we will start now and

00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:33,960
who whoever doesn't want to do that

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:37,440
that's the door and that also happened

00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,970
so in the process of changing not from

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,290
one day to the next but in the process

00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:46,770
of changing we probably lost 40 percent

00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:49,230
of employees but that is usually it's

00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,340
it's worse than it's it's not as worse

00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,970
as it sounds

00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:57,020
first of all it's not that 40% of our

00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:59,820
employees just stood up and left it's

00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:02,130
some figure out after wire that this

00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:04,430
this is not for them and some that some

00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:07,710
took four years to figure that out and

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,960
and it's at the same time lots of people

00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,460
started or wanted to

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,800
work for us because we're doing that so

00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,080
that that wasn't necessarily a bad thing

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,480
it's just something that you should keep

00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:21,109
in mind that what whatever change you

00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:26,000
you implement or forced or whatever you

00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:28,060
will lose people at some point so that's

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,770
why I said it's not as bad as it sounds

00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:33,140
and it's not like you would lose half of

00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:35,750
your workforce within two days at least

00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:38,599
I hope that never happens and in the end

00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:41,510
that that's actually what what made me

00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,390
be here because I that probably wouldn't

00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:56,510
be the case if we had tried to do things

00:43:44,390 --> 00:44:05,240
the way we did before thank you mmm you

00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:07,220
see if another question oh yeah well

00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,640
that's that's a good one I guess you all

00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:14,720
know the debian popularity contest if

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:19,310
you check the stats recently yeah hey

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:21,560
don't don't cheat so by the means of the

00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:24,080
debian popularity contests what is the

00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:29,170
currently most popular package by vote

00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:44,510
and I was kind of surprised any any

00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:47,930
guesses now it's it's something that the

00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:50,220
tells a lot about debian I think it's

00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:53,730
pearl bass

00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:59,120
I expected something else I don't know

00:44:53,730 --> 00:45:01,950
what but not always I guess nobody

00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:04,110
seriously I still have some copies here

00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,180
and if anyone wants to take one I'm free

00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:08,880
I'm happy to give to hand them out and

00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:11,250
if someone wants one and there's there

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,560
not enough we can also send what all you

00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:18,360
can buy one but I'm happy to you to

00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:19,580
provide for you I guess you prefer the

00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:24,870
English version

00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:27,480
sure well just just step forward and

00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:30,000
then then I can give you one and that's

00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,530
so that's it's so far from us it's just

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,050
one more thing just a second

00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:43,910
and I'm I'm done after that

00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:46,910
informational so oh wow that was

00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:51,510
unexpected

00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:53,100
so we we do have different ways of

00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:56,100
interacting with us for example we have

00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:58,290
a regular talk thing that happens at our

00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,700
office which is Lindos which is probably

00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:03,150
not of much use of you if you're not

00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:05,550
from the era just love but we have lots

00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:07,770
of talks to different topics and they

00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:11,580
usually are being recorded and you can

00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:13,680
see those recordings there we have a

00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,710
block which has sometimes also English

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,840
technical posts and there will also be

00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,810
soon a blog post about the unattended

00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,230
upgrades thing what Genk talked about

00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,320
yesterday

00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:27,870
and you can also find some other stuff

00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:32,910
about densa bill and mysql and whatever

00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:35,280
whatnot and there's also various ways to

00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:37,200
to visit us and actually did this was

00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,650
some kind of unintentional product which

00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:44,550
has spun up in the last years usually we

00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:46,380
just received visitors during your lunch

00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:50,310
and show them around and at some point

00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:53,910
this took it took a well away a lot of

00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:55,440
time from certain people and well this

00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:57,030
is one of this is how you tell me make

00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:02,460
products buy it by accident because we

00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:03,490
had to channelize this and stop how many

00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,030
people ever store

00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:09,060
group start had to stop larger groups

00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:12,820
from visiting us at least uninvited and

00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:14,680
if you need any more information feel

00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:17,740
free to visit us in this Olaf and if

00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:21,790
someone is near just contact Jenko

00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:23,230
myself and oh by for lunch and we'll see

00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:26,560
you in this Olaf and we're also hiring

00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:27,300
but yeah that's it

00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:33,869
