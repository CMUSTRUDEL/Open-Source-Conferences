	00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,540
so hey welcome I read your lightning

00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:14,199
talks um we'll do it like this we have

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,300
the Latin talks over there um

00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:19,100
in general the the famous a lightning

00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,720
shock is five minutes and a live game

00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,130
was ten minutes but if you're faster

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,500
it's no problem

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,450
we have probably enough time so if you

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,410
over run a couple of seconds

00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:34,430
I won't immediately cut you off for me

00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:37,040
in case it's me but if you're really

00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,160
running over time then we'll have to get

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,730
through the next person there's a

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,860
microphone here so you can speak into it

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,600
we don't need your cable you up there is

00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:51,470
a clicker here to advance slides or you

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,440
just use the the notebook I'll try to

00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:57,140
switch slides I think I have all of the

00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,079
slides now for that and maybe not not

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:05,059
wookies so we can just at the end

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:07,310
quickly switch notebooks so yeah without

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:10,810
is there any other questions about the

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,810
process now yeah

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,090
what should I move this

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:27,060
makes sense so we see the the the

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,630
resolution is just slightly off here I

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,890
hope it works

00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,180
I'm sorry if there's a problem what's my

00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,020
fault and maybe we have to switch

00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:41,950
notebooks okay

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:53,590
so first up is Martin for good talking

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:56,679
about all MIMO ok this is not a

00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:13,450
technical talk but a purely promotional

00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:16,650
talk I try this no yeah ok the pointer

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,940
needs to be inside of the content

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:26,500
interesting ok

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:28,989
oh memo is now well supported in Debian

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,870
and I like to promote this a little bit

00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:36,870
or MIMO what is it it's end-to-end

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:40,840
encryption for XMPP or Java

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:44,530
everybody knows OTR but OTR it does not

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:49,299
work when you have multiple devices or

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:52,230
on offline contacts you probably know it

00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:57,100
from conversations well-known

00:02:52,230 --> 00:03:02,260
application for Android for XMPP and all

00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:05,739
the yeah the algorithm comes from signal

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:08,109
and yeah matrix uses practically the

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:12,030
same trust and a different name it's

00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:16,060
called own and may go on megaohm yeah

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:20,319
yeah yeah but it's it's all the same or

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:23,739
less and there are apps for Android and

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,680
iOS programs for desktop and web clients

00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:31,840
which will support it so in Debian 9 we

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:36,580
had only one XMPP client supporting on

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,890
and fortunately in Debian Buster this

00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:42,580
will improve and this is exactly the

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:49,870
promotion I like to do please try them

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:52,629
out Dino C+ and even on the command line

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:57,340
and console there's tray P can you read

00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:59,790
this actually yeah okay so you can even

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:05,459
have this encryption on the command line

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:13,060
and in two different control clients so

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:16,680
please encrypt use staff help us and

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:21,639
there with a packet ring documentation

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:34,150
fruit many screens and try things thank

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:39,070
you what's the question can you repeat

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:42,460
the question about pigeon and in fact

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:46,139
there is a plugin for patron supporting

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,330
a memo but it's not yet in Debian so

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:58,330
sorry for all the old timers using

00:04:49,330 --> 00:05:01,060
pigeon okay it has been said that it

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:05,260
doesn't work so a good reason to not

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,880
have it an alien also because Debian has

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,880
only software that works right

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:19,410
[Applause]

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:26,819
okay thanks watching so next up is well

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:29,449
I'll try to do a live demo what let's

00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:29,449
see for the works

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,060
while this thing work don't do them

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:18,670
okay so what I'm gonna do is quickly

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:23,070
chalk a about Patroni um so in

00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:26,140
general this is about fully automatic

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:29,500
PostgreSQL high-availability with debian

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:33,220
and this is something that I've been

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,770
working on a bit on company time

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,210
first up packaging the the software

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,980
which is called Patroni which I get to

00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,840
in a second and second tranche entry

00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,780
credit into debian because Patroni is

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:48,580
cloud native so it's usually run in

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:53,410
docker containers and it uses other

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:55,270
stuff so it wasn't very easy maybe some

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,820
of you were in Crystal's talk about how

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,240
Debian packages Postgres or the

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,820
post-crisis ecosystem and we have this

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,830
PostgreSQL common a wrapper and patron

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,690
II was totally unaware of that

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:12,370
it's like installing into opt basically

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,950
so there was some there was quite some

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,460
work to do to get it integrated as an

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,780
overview it's a project by Solano the

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:24,480
company medimix or that sells shoes

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:27,250
basically MIT license it's Python and

00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,040
basically it configures Postgres

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:33,400
instances and the replication between

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:36,190
them and then a does failover or switch

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,810
over and how it basically works is it

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:43,990
uses at CD or zookeeper or console but

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,460
at CD is maybe the most easiest or well

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,160
no no you already have it in your data

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:51,310
center as a distributed consensus store

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,830
DCs so it's basically a key value store

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,290
it uses the the raft algorithm for

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,650
leader election so you can be sure that

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,140
there's only one leader and that leader

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:04,300
has a time to live and constantly

00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,490
updating its leader key and in the key

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,900
value store and if it doesn't happen

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,920
anymore then there is a new leader

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,220
election

00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,380
demonstrate that and in general this

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:18,610
this raft algorithm makes sure that

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:22,260
there's really only one member of the

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:27,970
class writing a particular configuration

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:30,340
set this lets us avoid split brain

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,840
scenarios when you have an uneven number

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,680
of notes usually you would have a free

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,990
note

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:40,090
Patroni cluster there are several other

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,130
infos that it stores in an ad CD or in

00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:46,090
the other dcs it's like the cluster

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,520
status and which at which time or at

00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,960
which point in the transaction lock a

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,570
particular stamp is so you can figure

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,850
out which one is the closest to a

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,610
primary in case you need to promote any

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,110
one what you can optionally do and I'm

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,740
not going to show that as you can for

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,710
example it well Patroni exposes a rest

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,710
api and you can use for example h a

00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:11,410
proxy to route incoming connections to

00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,810
the primary or if they are rather

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:16,060
read/write connections or to a secondary

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:19,540
if they're read-only connections for

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,070
read scaling and even more optionally

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,590
you can use comfy but I think comfy

00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,650
isn't even Demi and yet to write the HF

00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,600
oxy configuration but you can just use a

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:32,950
configuration management system or just

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,570
whatever you want so this is the very

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,700
complicated way if it works but you can

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,340
get ignore basically the H a proxy stuff

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,270
so you have a master and a replica or

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,260
rather two replicas usually all running

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,060
Postgres and then you have this Patroni

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,520
unfortunate cotrona does not have a logo

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:53,670
yet so you have a Patroni instance

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,700
sitting on top of it like an operator

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:59,500
pattern in in kubernetes and managing

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,140
the Postgres instance and they're

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,660
talking to at CD or in patronise talking

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,360
to a CD both of them and there's a

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,740
replication going on so in debian most

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,050
of the patches are now in and one five

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,250
five is the almost current version I

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,140
think one five six has been released

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,820
couple weeks ago so it's in Debrecen now

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,890
and we have integrated it into

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,430
post-crash cocom so for example now

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:23,320
Patroni instances show up in PG Alice

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,820
cluster

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,740
the binaries are where you would expect

00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,800
them in a debian Postgres install the

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:34,060
log files are there one problem is that

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:37,060
PostgreSQL conf is currently or Patroni

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:40,540
links that it still likes to manage this

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,890
one so you have to make sure that it's

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,600
not overwriting whatever you want it

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,550
there and for more information you can

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:53,130
see those there's a blog post and there

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:53,130
is a sensible playbook okay so let's see

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:07,240
I'll so I'll do it I'll start I'll have

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:12,400
a couple of busta based aleksey

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:14,440
containers and I'll start with starting

00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:21,060
up a so-called master container which

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,060
basically just runs at CD

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:29,080
I'll just deploy the master part of that

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,970
and in the hands of all from the angelo

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,570
playbook so it's it since basically just

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:39,610
installing at city at this point so and

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:47,220
then we will start three alexey

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:47,220
containers called PG 1 PG to in PG 3

00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:01,350
so now we have these four containers

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:05,860
running on that on that Network and I'm

00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:10,480
going to install Patroni on all of them

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:20,770
so let's see I'm going to cup and paste

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:23,020
a bit here going to copy this over for

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:27,250
measure and then I'm going to install

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:29,800
first post com1 every one of them what

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,560
I'm gonna do is I'm going to tell post

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,960
pesco not to create a post Christ

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:40,570
cluster immediately because Patroni will

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:47,560
do that and then I'm just going to

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:59,620
install tronie and post press now I'll

00:12:47,560 --> 00:13:07,900
copy over the so-called GCS file it's a

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:14,100
jumbo file and we'll put in the master

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:14,100
IP address that's already there

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:26,610
so I'll copy this over and the other

00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:30,779
thing I'm going to copy over from one of

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:38,040
the classes is the config I'm in and I'm

00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:40,910
going to quickly allow for Network

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:55,319
installation and that's also here

00:13:40,910 --> 00:14:09,060
already so at that point I'm going to do

00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:10,649
the installation mm-hmm yeah I guess I

00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,319
have to no mess it up in that sense that

00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:15,779
it's already installed mm-hmm well what

00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,399
I can show you is that well it's not

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:25,709
very interesting to actually install

00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:31,589
Patroni so what we have here is is the

00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:35,339
Patroni things running so I'm going to

00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:39,860
log into each of them and start up the

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,860
Patroni instance I was creating before

00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:45,889
which is similar to post-crisis is

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:54,689
called 11 for the worse in their tests

00:14:45,889 --> 00:15:00,170
so we have one here we will jump to this

00:14:54,689 --> 00:15:07,980
one started counting one from PG three

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:09,149
and one incoming from PG one so we're

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,540
you see now that this one is the leader

00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:11,540
and

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:24,120
I can basically now connect to hide the

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:28,690
one of the three saying I want to

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:40,329
connect to the writable Postgres

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:41,980
instance so I'll just run that in the

00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:43,930
loop so you see that this is just

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:48,279
returning the server address which is

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:51,790
the delete mo and if I'm shutting down

00:15:48,279 --> 00:16:00,519
the leader from outside because for

00:15:51,790 --> 00:16:01,300
example it has a failure that's thanks

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,670
for telling me

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:08,850
so basically I'm just setting it down to

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,850
bad

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:21,139
I'm sorry this was yeah this didn't work

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:28,220
my password okay anyway we have to shut

00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:29,750
down the leader no wait a second what we

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,230
gonna do I'm going to show you first

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:48,500
good for just very quickly the

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:51,500
switchover functionality so I'm logging

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:54,199
in to be either one of them and then I'm

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,079
telling it to please switch to PG one is

00:16:54,199 --> 00:17:00,110
the leader and you can see now that the

00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:02,120
IP address has changed to 185 which is

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:16,280
the new leader and now I can again

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:18,890
switch it off and what's off so there's

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:26,689
a failure but after a couple of seconds

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:29,890
Patroni should be able to recover from

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:29,890
this and I like the newly year

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,340
there we go so now that was a leader

00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,799
election and then PG 2 is not a new

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,549
leader and what I again you can connect

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:47,370
here to one on one that's basically the

00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:50,100
get out of it you will have so basically

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,440
you have still you can install this on

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,299
on three machines and if one goes down

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,070
it will just immediately go to the next

00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,990
one you have to configure your clients

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,270
somehow but that's pretty easy with

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,990
newer Postgres versions or you can use h

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:06,409
a proxy or something and once you start

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:20,460
up the old one again you can put it back

00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:22,200
into the cluster yeah I just started it

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,440
but yeah thanks for mentioning that I'm

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,440
sorry

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,660
and it's back there and it will

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:41,549
automatically figure out that there's

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:52,799
some problem and reclone and be back in

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:57,059
in business so we can do another switch

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,620
over and it's going to be back to the

00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:35,549
master and you can see it's going to you

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:39,990
okay that's that's basically yeah so

00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:53,580
next up Adam barofsky about first time

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:56,549
right yeah some support is already in

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,909
but most will be coming and at this

00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:04,230
moment just labelled that are not used

00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:11,960
by anything and before I ask you to add

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:16,590
support at least describe what it is for

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:27,380
the idea is to put some things other

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:27,380
than the slots because a lot faster

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,900
[Music]

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:56,910
it's a lot faster than large discs but

00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:13,440
still slower than diagram but at least

00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:19,860
it's but available implementations like

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:26,429
and with him and with pockets but the

00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:29,730
one experience with is named obtain DC

00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:37,710
politician from Intel just for a

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:41,550
constant yes so what can be used for

00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:45,059
well for existing programs you can use

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:48,960
its noble as noble volatile memory well

00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:53,570
you can ask why use it as volatile if

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:58,260
it's persistent but it's no way then you

00:21:53,570 --> 00:22:02,520
can get many terabytes of memory in one

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:05,970
machine if for example in the diffuse

00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:12,240
implementation you have up to half a

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:18,320
terabyte phone stick so if you have six

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,320
terabytes of memory for the cheapest

00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:31,650
about that use them at the moment so

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:40,110
it's there is a completely transparent

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:44,400
hard work mode which takes and takes you

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:50,789
sort of cash but it's more like like

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:53,710
swap but that's why let's

00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:59,289
of course faster than swapping to a disk

00:22:53,710 --> 00:23:02,769
it's quite stupid because it doesn't

00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:05,499
know that the data you already possessed

00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:13,889
it can be forgotten

00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:18,549
and you would want some other data that

00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:23,159
was not least recently used so ethics

00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:30,220
data that what you want hot but doesn't

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:36,039
but keeps what you would go so you can

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:47,169
use it in manually this software changes

00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:53,139
the multiple libraries because it knows

00:23:47,169 --> 00:24:01,210
which is what normal note and because

00:23:53,139 --> 00:24:07,779
most new machines new not just at once

00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:10,960
for example recent death process MMD

00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:14,730
have have fall in Numa notes in one

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,039
socket and so on and then if you can get

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:24,009
no more support you want it even without

00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:26,110
persistent memory and this part kernel

00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:29,499
part said that hasn't yet been remarked

00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:37,570
that the does the best of the towards if

00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:41,950
you don't tell it anything it you can

00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:58,480
tell it which data you want to be kept

00:24:41,950 --> 00:25:02,250
hot it's a lot faster than the best but

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,250
the there is

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:13,710
one problem because of memories but I

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:17,580
disable so if you write something then a

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:21,120
power loss can stop right at any

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:24,840
unexpected moment and a lot of software

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:30,330
usually databases actually uses that

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:33,120
sector atomicity it so there is a sector

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:38,760
mode that can emulate that but that

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:42,659
costs speed sure that all software has

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:45,929
has been fixed that don't suffer from

00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:50,789
that problem anymore and that's a

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:55,350
problem that up streams and maintenance

00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:59,070
of databases would have to find out and

00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:02,820
fix then you don't have to pay that

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,919
penalty anymore and this and extra

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:09,990
goodies that there's a mountain and

00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:14,279
ducks which lets you access the data on

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:18,899
the disk on the memory directly without

00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:23,490
even having to copy it to to the lambdas

00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:27,260
no page cache and so on you read the

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:36,919
data directly when it's stalled but it

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:41,220
still mostly compatible with software

00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:44,580
but the real fun starts with you started

00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:54,090
I think not if software for persistent

00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:57,750
memory because you don't yet have to be

00:26:54,090 --> 00:27:03,010
modest and can at most

00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:07,990
amirite is software and that software is

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:12,549
coming quite slowly but the idea is that

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:16,029
that you morally map the whole disk it's

00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:18,789
quite a bit of problem on 252 bit

00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:26,799
architectures because if the first step

00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:34,450
is to Omaha up six terabytes then 50

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:47,080
bits it's a bit won't be libraries for

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:50,260
duty bit so instead of sharing data and

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:53,320
in saving key to you you operate all the

00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:59,039
time on the live data that that's that's

00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:06,970
persistent but you need to do all the

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:10,840
flashes otherwise crash should have some

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:20,289
data still in in the supporters there

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:24,899
are some instructions that doesn't when

00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:29,230
you ask it and they they don't have to

00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:32,260
read the calendar at all because going

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:37,440
to the corner it's quite some day

00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:42,580
services compared to normal accesses so

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:46,990
you can have the data that's fully

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:52,059
persistent at at all time without a

00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:56,669
single sis core of the that has been set

00:28:52,059 --> 00:29:00,929
up but this software needs to be

00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:00,929
packages and so on

00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:16,059
[Applause]

00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,059
next up is young

00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:43,450
okay just good so I gave this talk the

00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:45,669
the title providing the smallest

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,980
fingerprint in the web and before

00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:49,750
starting with this I may have to

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:53,110
introduce me a little bit to understand

00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:54,640
why I go this way my professional

00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:56,230
background is technical product

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,380
management for high-tech products that

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,090
means I'm working for companies like the

00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,190
you look at the the tech ducts in in

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,870
Germany these are my clients and when

00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,900
I'm working for them I have to be

00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,669
invisible for their competitors and the

00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,100
competitors should not find out what I

00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:15,940
am then look more or less looking for

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:18,090
and that drives me or that drove me to

00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,409
set up a kind of virtual machines plus

00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:26,110
laptop configuration that it's is

00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:28,870
handleable for me and get the data that

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:32,169
I need and provide the minimum data to

00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,250
the website that I'm looking at maybe

00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:34,840
something about my background my

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,600
background is definitely technical I've

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,850
an electrical engineering plus a

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,679
computer science and I don't have any

00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,900
trouble to dive into the technical

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,880
details but nevertheless I usually don't

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:50,919
want to this is what I've already

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,020
mentioned I just want to jump into the

00:30:50,919 --> 00:31:01,030
details the the surrounding is more or

00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:03,429
less my laptop and okay yeah no problem

00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:06,309
this is this is more this the

00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:08,950
surrounding area here is the the host

00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:10,929
system that I'm using and I have two

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,909
gateways to the outside world which one

00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:15,070
is the VPN tunnel and the other one is

00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:18,850
USB and let's start with a VPN tunnel

00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:22,990
the VPN tunnel and this firewall its IP

00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:25,179
tablespace is their technical link

00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:28,570
together which means the if I start the

00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:32,230
VPN the firewall knows which VPN type

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:34,480
I'm using TCP UDP or OB FS and it opens

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:37,450
the Rick the necessary parts and nothing

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,730
else the firewall itself never ever

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,260
answers to any ping so this system is

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,870
more or less invisible in

00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:46,840
something like the the local Wi-Fi here

00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:50,020
and this is something that also caught

00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,780
me here because this this the router

00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:54,850
expects that I answer some sort of ping

00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,010
and my system doesn't answer and it

00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:59,110
kicks me out after thirty minutes so I

00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,360
have to find a way to recon to reconnect

00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:04,360
it and this is some sort of cron job

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,190
that already already does it this USB

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,200
connector is something like a must-have

00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,570
for me because I have to make sure that

00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,130
I get backups of my data and when I talk

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,620
about backups of my data I'm talking

00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,960
about approximately 200 gigabytes which

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:20,170
is synchronized with our sink on a

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,230
portable USB stick daily and a full copy

00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:26,290
is made every week on to hard drives and

00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,870
the data of the two hard drives is

00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:31,030
identical and compared with diff so I

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:34,540
need something like a USB connection

00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:37,480
that is fast and this is the user data

00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:39,010
that I am I am backing up so let's look

00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,460
at the middle part the middle part is

00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:44,560
simply tor browser located on the host

00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,270
system plus two virtual machines and

00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,850
these virtual machines are some sort of

00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:55,990
the templates and I named them mini ads

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:59,320
and W safe let me know Jesus this is

00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:01,000
still an old an old picture inside I did

00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,060
not send you the update sorry oh my

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,040
fault let me start with the safe version

00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,320
the safe version is a virtual machine

00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,200
based on Debian nine and I deleted all

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,760
the stuff that I don't need which is the

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,910
office package and something else that

00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,250
comes around the the virtual machines

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:21,130
just have to ah browser bundle install

00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:23,320
and Firefox installed and the Firefox is

00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:26,110
configured in a way that it uses the the

00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,410
proxy part of the tor browser and then I

00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:32,980
go with Firefox through tor through IP

00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:35,640
tables to the outside world Firefox

00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:39,220
itself has two different configurations

00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,760
one is just as Firefox comes when you

00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,440
install it and I've just added a user

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,450
Jes with some minimal configurations it

00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,750
deletes all the data after exit and

00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:51,040
that's it and the the second

00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,440
configuration is based on the stuff that

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,330
the folks in this called privacy hunt

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,400
boot te recon

00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:01,150
I think it's very well-known here in the

00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:03,700
German area and this is the EDD hardened

00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:06,100
version and if a website now says when I

00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,840
connected with tor browser don't get

00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,720
access then I say okay fine

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,000
next step is Firefox using the one with

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,740
the privacy handbook stuff and if this

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,600
doesn't work I take the other profile

00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:21,940
with the minimal just with a very tiny

00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,300
changed configuration and if they also

00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:28,600
don't let me in I switch to this virtual

00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,370
machine the W min adds one and what you

00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,020
should cross out in mind right now is

00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:34,149
this table router this link does not

00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,350
exist it's just the Firefox with the two

00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:37,870
configurations that I've already

00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:39,790
mentioned and then I start also with the

00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:43,120
with the safest version that includes

00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:45,940
stuff from the privacy handbook and then

00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,800
I take the the standard configuration so

00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,530
at least the minimum stuff that I have

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,419
to protect my identity is the VPN tunnel

00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,179
which is always up and running and IP

00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:58,600
table to make sure that no data bypasses

00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:01,150
this tunnel and that's a way let's say

00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,820
to to do some sort of digital uncovering

00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,260
yourself stepwise and see how long it

00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,360
takes until you get the data you need

00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,670
because it's not an option for me to say

00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,380
oh what folks I've heard my PC are

00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,120
harden my brows and if the website

00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:17,500
doesn't let me and I don't want to see

00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:21,280
it because I have to get the data based

00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:24,910
on this configuration I did some some I

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,580
try to get some data this is again where

00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:30,490
I what I did in the when hardening this

00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,110
stuff and this is again what I mentioned

00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:37,030
right now what the configuration can

00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:40,180
read it if you want to as I mentioned

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:43,720
before the I have these virtual machines

00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:47,770
that I showed here these are some sort

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:49,420
of a template and in the background runs

00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,930
a cron job and this current job

00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,280
duplicates the virtual machines to make

00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,170
sure that I always have a clone

00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,630
available which I can use for just one

00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,820
job and when the job is done I'm going

00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:03,730
to close it and delete it and what you

00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:06,790
may see here is that there exists some

00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,260
clones and the the name the base name is

00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:11,170
always the same and it has some

00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:13,450
sort of a nametag at the end and if I

00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:15,040
delete a page the cron job just says oh

00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:19,390
that's missing one I'm going to recreate

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:22,570
one so this goes pretty fast and the the

00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:25,030
tricky stuff was these two options that

00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:29,290
I've I've made in bold here which is

00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:33,070
modal and register mode all says create

00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:36,490
a new MAC address and make a full copy

00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:41,980
of their of the template and register it

00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:44,110
with this with this interface here this

00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,000
is how it comes up you need some sort of

00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:48,220
good resolution because the resolution

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,310
of the web's of this virtual machines is

00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,530
based on the 14-inch system and I did

00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,600
some some investigations about what is

00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,820
going on if I use a different operating

00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,440
system for the tor browser it says

00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:04,870
there's no difference the data comes

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:07,030
from pen optically tff dark and let me

00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:13,150
highlight something else what showed up

00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:15,160
here right now this set in italic is the

00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,470
the minimal configuration and it says

00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,020
that if I use my configuration that

00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,360
routes the Firefox through tor the

00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:25,870
result gets a little bit boris and I

00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,870
think this is because it has some stuff

00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:31,390
from tor inside the second or the third

00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:33,640
thing here is I did some tests with my

00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:37,060
standard resolution using Firefox and

00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,370
tour and it shows you that there is some

00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,190
sort of an impact if the resolution

00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:46,690
changes so your privacy gets worse if

00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:51,240
you leave these mostly used screen

00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:53,860
resolutions from a standard laptop and

00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,480
this is almost it so this is what I'm

00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,110
doing if you have any questions feel

00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,110
free to call me

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,790
[Applause]

00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,600
next up once is Alex wait have to

00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:02,540
yeah should he use the microphone okay

00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:12,530
perfect

00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:12,530
it's Megan hi okay I'll go to this side

00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,380
I got just I went to this talk and

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:24,660
everything I got was little worse

00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:27,869
so yeah hey unfortunately had nothing

00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:31,160
done of the things I wanted to do but I

00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:34,470
got some new stuff to do

00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:38,970
based on our talks yesterday at lunch

00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:41,490
and he was talked about backstage next

00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,240
station we decided that we want to make

00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:45,780
PPAs

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:49,910
finally happening and yeah

00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:54,839
[Applause]

00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:57,290
yes was was roughly our planners we are

00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:00,240
currently collecting ideas at this pet

00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:04,920
after the minute yep Kampf I will

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,480
transfer this pad to deepen Vicky where

00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:11,099
we are collecting some architectural

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,380
ideas some yes and problems something

00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:15,570
has already been done we will have to

00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:18,330
evaluate what's already happened at

00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:21,060
other debris where it's like humor as it

00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,980
says something we can reuse for PBS or

00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:27,089
do we have to do everything on our own

00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:30,570
and so on and we already decided that we

00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:32,430
will have a sprint in autumn probably

00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:38,280
zip gate in Dusseldorf thank you very

00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:40,640
much for offering the room so expect a

00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,460
mail on deep endeavor for me is only

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,820
where I'm asking for input and we

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,619
provide some paul where we can choose a

00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,530
date for the sprint and everyone is

00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:54,960
invited to help us we hope that we can

00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,880
up come up with a prototype after this

00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,109
print will be on a weekend from Friday

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,760
to Sunday but if it doesn't work out at

00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:05,700
least with that we will have a plan

00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,080
internet architecture about how PPA is

00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,260
integrated in society

00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,460
can look like yeah that's building leo

00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,690
for me so

00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:17,700
please send us feedback to my mail and

00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:19,680
if it's not feedback I will use my last

00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:23,839
master power to create a given PPI

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,579
mailing list and to get Singh standard

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,839
in better lists and to be endeavour so

00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:45,770
yes that's all for me

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:45,770
any questions yeah

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,100
talk amongst yourselves we've got video

00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,100
itis

00:43:51,849 --> 00:44:03,789
well this is different yeah I've got

00:43:55,249 --> 00:44:03,789
lots of applications to show people that

00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:16,220
[Music]

00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:16,850
wait okay right on the screen we'll see

00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,310
how this goes

00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,020
so I shouldn't have volunteered for this

00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:23,030
at the last minute and carefully arrange

00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,500
things talked may or may not fit into

00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:26,630
five minutes we'll see how it goes

00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,390
so slightly different from our usual

00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:32,810
fare I'm a caver

00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:35,450
I've been caving for a long time this is

00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:37,640
me in the early 90s when I still had

00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,410
hair and that's me last year so I'm

00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,790
still at it I really ought to have a

00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:42,200
little bit that by the way is the wind

00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:48,530
coming out of that hole we were really

00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:51,050
quite well quite excited the day we

00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:52,610
found that so this is just like nice

00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,900
picture just for those people who think

00:47:52,610 --> 00:48:02,930
caving is always tiny and miserable

00:47:53,900 --> 00:48:04,700
sometimes it's like this okay right fair

00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:06,320
enough and maybe I should do this if I'm

00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:10,520
gonna keep turning around can we do that

00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:12,140
you know and so so I got into free

00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,450
software because I started writing some

00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:18,770
cave survey software in 1990 which we

00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:20,720
decided to GPL newfangled thing and when

00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,190
I became a Debian developer seven or

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,530
eight years later I thought I should

00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,600
probably put my survey software in the

00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:28,040
destroy use so just to explain to people

00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,200
who know nothing about cave surveying

00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,000
the point is you go underground and

00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,260
measure some distances to work or your

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,730
cave goes and you come back with a

00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,730
scrappy little piece of paper like this

00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:39,200
with a lot of numbers on and dirt and

00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:41,019
some pictures which don't make much

00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,669
sense and you want to produce

00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:44,829
nice survey to work out where your cave

00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:47,739
goes so that for example in this case

00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:50,289
you can see there's some cave and some

00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:51,999
cave and a little gap which is probably

00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:53,469
quite exciting to potholders who really

00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:56,949
really like joining caves together to

00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:59,409
make bigger caves so back in the 70s

00:48:56,949 --> 00:49:00,969
having collected that data you got to

00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:02,380
draw that's absolutely illegible isn't

00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:04,089
it well I'm sorry but that's that's a

00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,339
hand-drawn survey you used a big piece

00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:08,649
of paper and work things out with the

00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:11,319
calculator and drew up what you were

00:49:08,649 --> 00:49:14,739
trying to survey but obviously we all

00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:16,449
got computerized eventually so this is

00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:18,009
kind of vintage of the software I've

00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:22,649
packaged this is the years they got into

00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:24,759
Debian so cervix was 2001 therians 2003

00:49:22,649 --> 00:49:28,539
and we'll just have a quick look at

00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:30,549
those as I have ammo cloud compare is

00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:32,649
one that actually I started trying to

00:49:30,549 --> 00:49:34,809
package in 2014 but it turned out it had

00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:36,039
non-free bits in it and I spent a long

00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:37,569
time going back and forth with the

00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,979
author going please can you change it so

00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:40,959
that your software which is amazing

00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:43,419
doesn't have this tiny non-free piece in

00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:45,009
it and he did eventually like three

00:49:43,419 --> 00:49:48,779
years later and eventually somebody else

00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:52,149
got around to uploading it so this is

00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:53,439
Farion so to get away from the actually

00:49:52,149 --> 00:49:55,149
drawing up on a piece of paper

00:49:53,439 --> 00:49:58,689
actually let's just have a quick play

00:49:55,149 --> 00:50:00,909
with tools so some software which is the

00:49:58,689 --> 00:50:03,909
wrong size

00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:09,989
anyone know what the xfce key for fit to

00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:13,719
the screen is f10 anyway so this is

00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:15,249
having your cave into the computer you

00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,259
can spin it around and have a look and

00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:19,029
you can look at it in a plan view in

00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:20,619
elevation and you can click on a point

00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:23,499
and say how far is that bit of cave

00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:25,509
whoops that B of cave from that bit of

00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:26,919
cave and down the bottom there's a

00:50:25,509 --> 00:50:28,719
distance this is incredibly useful

00:50:26,919 --> 00:50:30,279
information if you're trying to work out

00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:31,869
where you are so that's what this was

00:50:30,279 --> 00:50:34,539
like for about 15 years

00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:37,989
and then of course we got we finally

00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:40,889
taught it about geolocation so suddenly

00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:43,269
you can put things in the real world

00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:47,819
which so this is this is this is our

00:50:43,269 --> 00:50:50,319
cave system after 40 years of so that is

00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:52,389
136 kilometers of pothole looks like

00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,410
it's all very confusing and if we like

00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:57,260
we can turn on the entrances

00:50:54,410 --> 00:51:01,010
oh my god it's quite a lot entrances and

00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,059
this over here the other bit of cave so

00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,349
this is the second longest cave in

00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,210
Austria now and that's the longest cave

00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:06,109
in Austria which is 140 kilometers and

00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,150
as you can see they're not actually very

00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:12,140
far apart now which again is the sort of

00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:13,760
thing that excites pot haulers and so

00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,380
once you've got to your location you can

00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,030
do things like turn the terrain on and

00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:21,710
now you starting to get quite nice

00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:23,359
modeling of like what's going on you can

00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:26,740
you can see the lake surface down there

00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:32,839
and where you are in the mountain so

00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:34,400
back to so this is drawing without

00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,200
rockets to join drawing on the computer

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,390
so the whole process is now computerized

00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,240
there's no bits of paper involved and

00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,710
that's what therian lets you do so

00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,829
that's that's an elevation view and

00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:48,680
that's the plan view and also it has its

00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:51,559
own fancy viewer which is even scarier

00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:54,859
than the so this one you can you can

00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:56,630
drop a map onto your terrain surface and

00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:58,640
you can see little caves underneath and

00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:00,980
if I could drive it I could zoom in and

00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:04,460
out and go look okay so this is quite

00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,720
nice visualization software now it's not

00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:09,619
a lot of work to get that to come out

00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:17,359
but it does look snazzy so that was kind

00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:19,039
of mid 2000s where do we get to yeah

00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,720
uploaded some packages so there's

00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,400
another thing called a tunnel which is

00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,779
Java based software its basis is the

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,520
same thing and that's what we actually

00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:28,069
use in Austria which annoys me intensely

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,390
there's a thing called DX tool so we got

00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:32,119
digital eventually the instruments went

00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:34,880
digital as well this is a laser gadget

00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:38,000
which does the distance and the angles

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,829
and it will Bluetooth them to a phone or

00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,630
whatever or if you want to download to

00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:45,220
Linux you need a tool so that's what DX

00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:47,539
tool does is just the serial protocol

00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,170
I'm still trying to package them so one

00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,720
of the things you have to do is

00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:52,940
calibrate that device and calibration

00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,859
has involved a Windows box or an Android

00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,079
box for the last decade which is pissed

00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:58,490
me off intensely it is now possible on

00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:59,960
Linux but the software is not quite in

00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:04,299
Debian yet

00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,299
I started in 2008 you'll be working soon

00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:09,530
there's also cave view which is

00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,700
basically the same thing in in your

00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:13,670
browser because everything has to work

00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,410
in JavaScript these days and that's

00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:18,590
would be in Debian except that our

00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:20,450
version of 3GS is too old so I need a

00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:23,210
new one and then we can upload that and

00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:24,860
I spent the last two years trying our

00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,720
package cave where which is a thing

00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,640
again primarily built for Windows and

00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,400
Mac people it's quite a nice software

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,500
but fortunately it uses QBs and it turns

00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,630
out nothing in Debian uses QBs there's

00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,310
there's me basically with this and it's

00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:39,350
got like six dependencies which all use

00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:41,060
QBs so I ended up having to write the

00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,860
wiki page for how to make a debian

00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:45,860
package used QBs so this is what your

00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:48,530
rules file ends up looking like as reams

00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:49,910
of crap because deep package and

00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:51,200
everything just doesn't really work the

00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:53,840
same way queue so keep yes it's kind of

00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,369
replacement fork you make any problem is

00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,350
well Steven got all this working and

00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:58,910
then word still out like about eight

00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:01,040
months ago they decided that deprecating

00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:02,210
QBs and the new people that bought QT

00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,869
aren't paying for any more any Oh for

00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:08,480
 sake so that's kind of annoying

00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:09,859
sorry so far out of package do walls and

00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,080
lib Chris ad-lib squish that this is a

00:54:09,859 --> 00:54:13,250
little side effect of why this packaging

00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,230
really obscure software's actually

00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:18,200
useful so we did get QBs working in

00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:20,330
debian and it had libs questionnaire

00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,340
which is obscure graphics library for

00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,660
its kind of graphics the graphics cards

00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:26,240
all do themselves these days but it

00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,710
didn't used to and that there were seven

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,390
embedded copies of lib squish in

00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:30,920
different bits of debian all with a

00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:32,480
different patch for whatever purpose

00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,040
they needed so I ended up spending

00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,320
months fishing them or not finding out

00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,030
what the differences were collecting one

00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,619
set of patches that actually fitted

00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:42,200
together and sending it to the new

00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:43,460
upstream because it had moved and to be

00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,140
fair that guy was helpful talked all the

00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,940
patches so now there's one Lib squash in

00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,750
Debian and all those embedded things are

00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,750
removed so

00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:54,100
so this is why it takes me four years to

00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,480
get something into Debian because I

00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:59,500
actually tried doing it properly unlike

00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,760
everybody else and it takes forever all

00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,170
those people who went oh a slightly

00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,370
different version lib squish I'll just

00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,970
leave it embedded because that's so much

00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,830
easier

00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:08,790
so anyway I'm working away through this

00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:11,140
pile and that's basically it I think

00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:14,350
yeah I could show you more cave survey

00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:16,930
software but you know actually just a

00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:18,850
moment on this as it's the last talk so

00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:22,420
this is when you've got all those tiny

00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:27,340
little you imagine bits of cave if I key

00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:28,510
oh yeah okay so each each each of they

00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,160
remember that bit of paper I showed you

00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,120
with little snippets of drawings you end

00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,100
up with all these little snippets of

00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,810
drawings that went off the page and you

00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:37,270
scan them in and then you draw around

00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:39,640
them with this thing and basically this

00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:41,410
is a compiler that you say you know the

00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,670
end of this bit means to the end of that

00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,500
bit and then that bit connects onto

00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:45,850
there and then if you combine that with

00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,070
the centreline to actually set them in

00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:51,130
3d space you can get nice pictures at

00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:52,630
the end so it's it's all marvelously

00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,860
labor-intensive but it's marginally

00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,870
better than ting on a piece of paper not

00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,430
the first time but the next year when

00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:59,380
you come back and it goes off the edge

00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:01,570
of the page so I used to spend the 90s

00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:04,060
every year drawing the same five

00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:05,980
kilometers of thing and then a bit more

00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,510
on a slightly different sized page and

00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,580
eventually you go this is mad I need a

00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:11,800
computer so that I can just like make

00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:14,500
the page bigger so this is what we now

00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,720
have so debian is much better for cave

00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:18,610
surveying than any other distro because

00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,920
we have all this unbelievably obscure

00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:22,920
software in it that's it

00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,660
thanks wookie and thanks to all the

00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:36,490
speakers again lighting talks are over

00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:41,780
almost on time so thanks

00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:41,780
