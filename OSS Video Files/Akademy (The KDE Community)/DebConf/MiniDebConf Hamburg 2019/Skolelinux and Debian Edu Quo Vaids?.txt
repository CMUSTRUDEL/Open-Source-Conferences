	00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:15,050
awake enough to visit us talking about

00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:19,330
Debian edu I am Nick and this is my

00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:25,220
colleague we've done we are two of the

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:27,739
developers of Debian edu today in this

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,590
short talk we want to introduce you to

00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:33,230
Debian edu for those of you who don't

00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:38,629
already know what it is we will try to

00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:41,210
keep this very short then we want to

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:44,510
talk a bit about what we did in the

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:48,260
Debian faster development cycle in

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,899
Debian edu 10 which will be as a pure

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,039
blend released together with the regular

00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:56,809
Debian 10 release

00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:59,030
oh sorry then yeah and together with a

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:03,589
few remarkable things from the from the

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:07,550
development cycle after that I would

00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:10,040
like to digress a short into into the

00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,680
general topic of free software education

00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,990
because this is a very very special

00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:22,840
topic with a very special user base and

00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:26,480
finally we would like to present what we

00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,630
what we have planned for the for the

00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:33,470
bull's eye development cycle and for the

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,930
bull's eye release ok so that mean edu

00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,290
is a pure blend in Debian a pure bland

00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:42,110
for those who are new to the project or

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:45,380
haven't what this term is a set of

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,810
packages that can be installed on on top

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:51,170
of Debian that do

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:55,100
configuration stuff contain meta

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:58,670
packages to select a pre-selected set of

00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,310
software and using pure blends you can

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,660
actually turn Debian into a into a

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,030
distribution that is tailored to a

00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,179
special use case and for Debian edu this

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,310
means that you can pre configure a

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:14,270
complete educational network for school

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:17,190
including server operation for a server

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,230
that does all these complicated things

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,660
like l-dub kappa whoes for

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:26,880
authentication user management fire

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:30,180
storage backups monitoring email the

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,310
list is very long and on the other hand

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,620
also client operation to set up a

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,930
computer lab very quickly you can get a

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,850
desktop right from the right from the

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:43,140
server and boot into an educational

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:46,050
environment with an xfce desktop with

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,630
pre-selected applications either sorted

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,630
by by school level for preschools or

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,370
secondary schools or by the subject

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,700
matter like software for learning

00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:00,920
languages for learning Geographics

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:05,580
chemistry everything like that and

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:08,280
Debian Eddy bundles all that makes it on

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,110
one hand quite easy to set up such a

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,970
system last time we did this in a real

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:18,420
school we it took us four hours but also

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,930
provides a Advanced Management it allows

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,540
to do all the advanced stuff you want to

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,870
do with with an enterprise class network

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,459
because it's yeah it's Debian and you

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,650
can do everything you can do with Debian

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:37,500
but you in for for starting you get the

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:45,410
the whole stuff pre-configured tailor to

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:50,370
schools okay welcome yes used to be

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:53,910
monolithic kind of thing and it has been

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:58,230
the aim to be more modular that was

00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:02,340
inspired by Andrea's package Debian land

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,040
contract and that is a modular system

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,030
comparable comparable and you could put

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:14,910
a do packages upon that Debian our

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:19,440
config installation so with the plaster

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:23,310
reliefs Debian II do is modular more

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:27,680
modular that means you can install that

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:30,870
whole network stuff without the

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,130
educational packages installed at all

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:37,889
so that that was a feature from them

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:42,090
Union config and we have now the

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:46,919
possibility to set up site specific

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:50,310
installation for primary school only or

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:56,070
even for preschool and that has been

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:58,410
made possible by meta packages that are

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:03,060
school related the school level

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:07,940
education level related so this is a

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:12,560
meta package they stand from edo bundle

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:15,780
it upon to head that school level

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:22,169
packaging and this is now possible in

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:25,020
debian too so this is possible to do a

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:28,410
very site specific installation and all

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:33,990
that has to be done is at installation

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:37,440
time simply remove desktop equal xfce

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,680
from the kernel commander then you get

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,780
all this you get a naked system and can

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:49,370
install upon of it that was one goal

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:53,669
second goal was to have a better

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:58,349
localization they be inaudible used to

00:05:53,669 --> 00:06:02,660
ship localization packages for I guess

00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:06,900
eight languages that was a random set

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:10,680
now it is possible to have the

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:14,930
localization for each language that is

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,510
available in the Debian installer so

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:23,880
when you would do with this and the

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:27,000
common ways always use default then you

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,970
end up with this localized system for

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,960
the language with all packages installed

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:36,120
even for Thunderbird localized and but

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,260
it is even possible there's a script

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,189
when you have a country with several

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,099
languages or you

00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:48,050
bilingual school or something like that

00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:52,939
you can support different languages

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:57,110
let's use the standard tool local tools

00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:59,120
and then you can choose languages that

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:04,610
should be supported then there's a

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:07,699
script and all language related meta

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,499
package packages are installed and then

00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:13,310
you have a localized system for all

00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:17,180
these languages and students can choose

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,879
their environment as an example if

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:23,120
you're in Switzerland you might have end

00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:32,719
up with three or even four I don't know

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:38,919
exactly languages okay then this all is

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:43,249
made possible because the Debian CD team

00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:49,490
supported us to have officially created

00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:54,969
packages and besides the net installer

00:07:49,490 --> 00:08:01,550
image we have now a huge image almost

00:07:54,969 --> 00:08:05,599
six gigabyte and we are able to install

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:12,279
everything that I've told you out in the

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:19,009
woods without any internet connection so

00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:23,710
this is I guess good for countries that

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:28,310
are not so developed you can put a lorry

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:29,419
with all equipment network stuff drive

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,699
out into the woods

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:36,979
you only need electricity and you're

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:41,449
able to set up a whole school okay thank

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:44,240
you oh god yeah

00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:46,399
there are a few other points on this

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,560
slide we do not want to go into detail

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:54,470
about this yeah for those who are very

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,290
much interested in this please find us

00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:02,009
during the

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:04,860
friends mostly in the kitchen okay yeah

00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:07,620
I want to do a short digression into the

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,769
field of education and free software

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:14,130
education in general we see today that

00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:18,509
there is a very rapidly growing growing

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:21,750
movement towards open education but it's

00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:25,290
quite focused on open educational

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:29,009
resources like open textbooks open

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:33,389
worksheets open materials for for

00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:36,990
teaching stuff the the software side the

00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:40,139
the free software side is a very

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:44,250
different topic it's mostly due to

00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:47,040
different due to political issues at

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:50,250
least in in Germany and probably in most

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,639
other countries there are contracts with

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,880
large software companies there is this

00:09:52,639 --> 00:10:00,180
impression that students need to learn

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,470
how to use certain certain products

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,540
instead of learning how to use a

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:09,209
computer which is not the case really it

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,610
would be more important if students

00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,769
learned how a computer works and how

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,130
software works in general and they can

00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:22,079
learn the country must have on on top

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:27,480
later but this is nothing that you can

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:31,220
that we succeeded at conveying to the

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:35,040
the high decision-makers in in education

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,519
but there is a growing interest in that

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,380
stuff

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:43,160
teachers both computer science teachers

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,630
but also teachers from from other areas

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,860
they know that something has to change

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:52,920
they now with Windows 10 on the on the

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,319
rise or I think it's a right now the

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,699
only supported Windows version at least

00:10:55,319 --> 00:11:02,069
in a few months or so they have heard

00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:05,399
and realized that there are major

00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:07,480
privacy issues with this and they have

00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:12,070
also realized that

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:14,350
they probably should not hence this - to

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:16,720
children or our students but there isn't

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:22,260
a solution because they are forced to

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:26,800
use Microsoft or Apple by by politics

00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:28,030
but errors interest we we we see that

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,010
there is interest when we are at

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:33,220
conferences or on conference booths talk

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:36,610
to teachers this is growing rapidly as

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:40,050
well I hope that this will work out to

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:44,110
change something when time goes by

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:46,540
somehow we managed to find a school in

00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,450
Wahpeton that is that has now committed

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,030
to only using free materials and free

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:54,250
software whenever this is possible there

00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:57,760
are points where this isn't possible

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,320
because the there is for example a

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,780
school management software that every

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,050
school in the state has to use and

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,400
there's only runs on Windows but in all

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,640
areas where it is possible they

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,430
committed to be free and open and they

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,810
also they also use scholarly notes in

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:18,790
the entire school and they are also open

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:22,440
for everyone visiting and seeing how

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:25,570
this works getting a presentation there

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,840
so now we can present Debian edu and

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,790
other free software in a real world set

00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:35,890
up in inner school without any

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:40,360
limitations we had a small this

00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:42,640
discussion among the developers that are

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,760
here whether we wanted to go in the

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,890
direction of so supporting Microsoft

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,800
Windows clients better they've been

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:55,390
educated handle Apple and Microsoft

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:57,190
clients with without issues but we like

00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,080
other school networks to load solutions

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,890
we don't have stuff like providing

00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:06,520
Windows images into the network or stuff

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,320
like that but we actually think that it

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,470
is important that together with a

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:16,590
software distribution we also inform

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:18,310
people and help people get free from the

00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,470
from the

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,279
from the closed ecosystems and vendor

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,319
logins

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,360
this is a very important trust it is

00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:33,839
actually also packaged with the

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:37,870
distribution in some way ok for the

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:41,259
bullseye ready release we took some

00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:44,649
ideas that we got as feedback from from

00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:46,329
teachers at conferences or also from

00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:49,600
educational conferences like the

00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:54,550
aeronautica in Hamburg that took place

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:59,050
the last two years and while in Debian

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,730
edu 10 we worked on a bit of yeah let's

00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,749
say perfectionism getting all that is

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,680
that was they're in really good shape

00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:07,569
improving the features that were already

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,040
there adding a small feature here and

00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:11,470
there like the offline installation

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:16,259
working together with a CD team and now

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:19,959
for Debian edu 11 we hope to add some

00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:23,439
features that modern schools need for

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:26,529
the digitalization like mobile device

00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:28,629
management to integrate Android and iOS

00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:31,180
devices into the net into the network

00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:33,730
and do some basic management stuff with

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:38,379
them like pre configuring certificates

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:42,360
email clients next cloud clients or

00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:46,230
something something like that we also

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,490
talked about integration of of apps so

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,189
teachers who administrate such a network

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,319
don't necessary if they want for example

00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:55,259
Moodle as a learning management system

00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:58,000
they can just get this from inside

00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:00,850
Debian edu with a pre-configured set of

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,920
options that works well with with with

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:09,750
the rest of the system one point our

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,910
interactive whiteboards or smart boards

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,639
there's a very there's a very big closed

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:18,040
ecosystem providing smart boards to

00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:24,040
schools and it doesn't or really work

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:26,259
very well in on Linux Mike son Weaver

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,620
who is also part of the debonair team is

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:31,260
working very hard on getting open boards

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,360
into Debian

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,640
to provide the smartboard functionality

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,200
like drawing doing presentational stuff

00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:42,540
on an interactive whoo I bought and

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,850
there's another site for supporting the

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,030
the hardware that is used for this which

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,910
will become a bit more difficult but we

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:53,160
will see how this how this goes

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,620
in the last point is decentralization so

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,690
we can interconnect

00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,310
Debian edu networks like when schools

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,020
have a partnership and do courses

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,390
together that students can use their

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:06,290
login from one school at the other

00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:08,880
school or if a city wants to set up a

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,460
central solution there where where all

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:19,410
schools use the same system they can do

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:21,690
this in a in a good way okay now this

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:27,330
slide has gone missing I don't know when

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:32,280
okay if you are in education or

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:34,920
interested in education we need you I so

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,500
I talked about what the difficulties are

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,860
there as there's a technical side for

00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,510
developing developing Debian edu we need

00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,650
more people there but there's also the

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:49,950
political and practical side on and

00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:52,710
marketing I said that education is a

00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:55,770
very special use a very special user

00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:59,220
base but it's also to be seen as a as a

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:01,620
customer base we need to sell a free

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,090
software product like it's like any

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,949
other product because that's what

00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,380
decision makers want they want to see ad

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,540
this is a this is a whole thing that I

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,500
can that I can use that I can get and

00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:16,079
this this this fits my needs while we

00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,660
are very proud to be the universal

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,400
operating system they don't want

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,680
something that can do everything and

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,070
here and they they want on the first

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,839
glance they want to see that this is

00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,450
something that solves their teaching

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,960
issues and there are a school network

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:37,850
operating issues and we need people who

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:41,490
make sure to convey this decide also

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,880
then of course we need people who maybe

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,919
are

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,100
are working together with schools or no

00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:50,230
schools who just use Debian edu in in a

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,630
small computer lab or something just to

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:56,230
get things started into to show what's

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:59,950
there to use it to try it out and get it

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:06,910
growing in a slow but somewhat

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:09,669
consistent way okay so that's everything

00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,220
from us we have 2 minutes left for a

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:16,950
short question and answer if there are

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:19,600
any questions but you can also find us

00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,140
during the rest of the conference if you

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,140
are interested

00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:27,640
[Applause]

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:50,140
on your slides you talked about Debian

00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:53,800
edu and schoola Linux oh yes my compare

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,480
and contrast it's just two names it's

00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,130
two names there used to be two

00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,440
distributions one from France one from

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,720
Norway you can read up on that on the

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,640
debian on the debian edu part of the

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,040
Debian Viki or in the Debian edu manual

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,490
as well but now it's only two names for

00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,590
the same thing they seem to work better

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,660
in different areas of the world where

00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:17,530
school is understand understood better

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:20,500
or education is understood better it

00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:24,370
also has shown that school school

00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:27,280
olynyk's describes the the product that

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:30,250
at all that I talked about better and

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,890
have been edited scribes the fact that

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,380
it is included with Debian better but

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:41,260
it's at the end it's just two names or

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:43,870
something well I have a question

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,850
but those white or smart boards can you

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,710
if you know a bit explain a bit more

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,230
about proms do you need a specific

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:53,410
hardware drivers or do they operate like

00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:56,700
regular input devices how does that work

00:19:53,410 --> 00:20:00,190
and and what's missing exactly there

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:03,280
there are very very many different types

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:06,910
of hardware some schools use a big

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,160
screen or a projector and in it and a

00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,930
touch tablet a vacuum tablet or

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,090
something this works really well because

00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:16,840
there is good hardware support for this

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:20,050
but then there are bots that like like a

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:23,950
big like a big board including a

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:27,520
projector or big screen and vendors

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,410
include quite complicated stuff into

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,560
that because they think it's fancy like

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:35,650
you have different color pens and you

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,900
can use them for four different people

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,570
who interact on the whiteboard or for

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,810
different different functions of the

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:47,080
whiteboard and stuff like that and this

00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:49,300
is this is all closed closed stuff

00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,720
there's one big vendor core Promethean I

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:55,150
think they do the most rigid marketing

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,750
also at the doctor and other education

00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,690
conference

00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:01,210
they used to have Linux support they

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,400
also used to have an open driver for

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,140
Linux but this has long gone they

00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,539
decided that they only support Microsoft

00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,390
maybe they have contracts there who

00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:13,120
knows but this has gone and we need to

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:17,260
work on this in some way because this is

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,120
what schools have it's there the threat

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,159
that they will just put Windows 10 on

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,169
the smart board and then have it totally

00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:27,159
closed off or is that always just

00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:30,850
peripheral I don't know everything that

00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:33,850
I have seen until now is only a display

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,010
and an input device for computer I don't

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,700
know do you know if anything else rivals

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:42,250
to interact with a smart board and years

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,190
ago we had this permiten thingy and

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,539
there was Linux support and we used that

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:51,940
at school

00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:54,539
I'm a retired teacher and this is gone

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,730
so you don't have the ability to

00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:01,600
interconnect with that smart board right

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,429
I reverse engineer that but I have the

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,350
feeling that at some point they will

00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:06,880
just put a computer into the smart board

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,070
with Windows 10 and then they'll just

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,470
ship it as a as a solution and don't we

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,210
no way at all to actually do anything so

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,740
the obvious solution that we is that we

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:23,590
should have a white board including

00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:28,539
Debian at you before they do this no

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:31,929
there's so when you said you didn't want

00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:34,419
to put in more Windows support to tell

00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:37,330
people that they should rather avoid

00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:39,340
that when they log in isn't that

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:45,280
effectively creating another when they

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:47,890
lock in good question I don't think so

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,110
because the software because Debian

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,990
collects software from so many different

00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:55,780
developers and so many different origins

00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:58,299
and sources so as a distribution we only

00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,490
put this together we might have patches

00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:04,929
but for its that that come from

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:06,549
debonaire directly but in that regard I

00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:09,530
see a little distribution more like a

00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:11,210
reseller that resells stuff from

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,300
all over the place from very many

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:17,090
different origins this is even if it

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,500
says Debian on the on the cover I do not

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:26,630
think this is something that you can

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:28,160
call for no login so to what degree how

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,100
people actually using this in their how

00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,140
many places or actually using Debbie

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,060
energy you fear for real schools as it's

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,000
still pretty obscure are we getting

00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,460
success in some places I speaking off

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,890
quite a long time years at least I know

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,760
how many years you've been at it better

00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:49,910
or worse it's getting

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,640
it has it depends yet it has it has

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,990
gotten worse throughout the last years

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,530
but I think it's getting better now

00:23:53,990 --> 00:24:00,380
there are more than a handful of schools

00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:03,200
in in more than two handful of schools I

00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:05,030
don't know maybe it's an Weaver if Mike

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,070
if you are listening please try to

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:10,820
answer on IRC how many schools you are

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:12,410
supporting I do not have real numbers on

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,170
that we used to have a small map where

00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,610
schools can add themselves but then it

00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:20,900
turned out that in the last year's it

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:25,040
was more more spam and vehicle reselling

00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:26,740
going on there and heading we don't have

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:33,280
real numbers because we don't track

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:37,850
users I would estimate a few hundred

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:40,300
schools maybe you can tell it yes world

00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:45,320
what you can tell it from popcorn and

00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:50,060
also from the subscribers of the Debian

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:54,020
idealist about 300 and then of course

00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:57,530
there are there are schools that use

00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:02,030
Debian I think in in in Greece there are

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:05,090
many many schools that use Debian with

00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,640
ltsp and they might be using parts that

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,680
we maintain or develop for Debian at you

00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,960
but they do not use Debian at us the

00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,440
whole product because of course you can

00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,870
also set up parts of that on a normal

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,840
day vm system so we do not have numbers

00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,970
I think we should change this to have at

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,530
least a few voices on

00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,210
as part of the marketing site we need to

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,760
have a few voices on a website that se

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:34,429
debía is great so but we don't have

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:36,200
numbers right right right okay so if

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:39,730
there's no more questions then let's

00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:45,630
thank Wolfgang and Dominic again

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:45,630
