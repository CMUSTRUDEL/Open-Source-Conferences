so welcome everybody again to our

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:15,260
opening keynote by Felix de Lara about

00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,260
open geo data of humanitarian action

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,440
[Applause]

00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:33,149
free yes now I'm gonna make yeah thanks

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,660
I'm very glad to be here it's my last

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,510
mind my first talk or like participation

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,410
in a Debian event in seven years I think

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,109
Wow

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,559
time is passing by so fast in the

00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:49,440
meantime I have been doing work with

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,800
maps with digital maps and different

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,949
parts of the world and how to use them

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,159
for for for good for international

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,739
cooperation and for humanitarian action

00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:04,680
my background I'm I studied digital

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:08,149
media I'm an open source since I'm I

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,939
don't know 12 11 something like that and

00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:14,759
and the last seven years I focused on

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:19,409
maps and especially on places where

00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:22,770
there are no maps those are still

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,950
surprisingly a lot of places in the

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,539
world and that has a lot of implications

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,630
to the people that live in those areas

00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:32,850
right if you are in Europe we used to

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,710
have a map and we sometimes even think

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,619
about them why do I need anything else

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,420
right because I can I have my my tools

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,670
that I use I have my maps that are

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,200
printed that I can read but that's not

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,270
the case everywhere and if you're not

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,359
living in a place where there is no map

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,509
you cannot figure out easily how to come

00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,909
from A to B and it will be difficult

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,929
maybe to reach a good doctor to know

00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,780
where's the next hospital and but it has

00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:03,149
also implications and access to jobs on

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,490
leisure right if you know where to go

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,679
you probably would combine your ways

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,160
more efficiently and you could you could

00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,019
have more fun in life and of course when

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,220
it there's a disaster then everything

00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:18,490
becomes like really essential and crew

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,250
important and in a case of a disaster

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:25,150
imagine that you don't have a way of how

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:29,260
to make even a plan of evacuation or

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,990
where to find the next water supply but

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,090
what if one could change that and of

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,400
course there's open source there are all

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,910
these tools so we can go online we can

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,880
use this and add information to it they

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,170
make the parts that matter to each of us

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,300
that could be the neighborhood but it

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,840
can be also other things in in your city

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,700
or your country one of the wonderful

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,400
things that you can do with maps is you

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,260
can travel and and at least in your

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,690
imagination and that's maybe also better

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,630
for the carbon footprint so I would like

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,250
to thank you to travel with me to some

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,160
places in the world and to see what

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,170
people have been doing with maps and I

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,850
wanted to start with you in Managua

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,110
Nicaragua where I've been living for a

00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,959
long time

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,940
this is not directly humanitarian but it

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,130
is definitely like development work that

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,700
we can do with maps and this way you

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,950
also have like a little bit more an

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,790
impression from myself and what I've

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,050
been doing so Nicaragua is also one of

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,140
those places where you don't have

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,610
necessarily a map of everything and and

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,989
we were like in those communities of

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,220
open source and we were saying hey we

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,320
want to do something you want to use

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:42,850
this technology to do something that

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,810
that helps us in our city and Managua

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:49,510
the capital of 2 million inhabitants is

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:53,140
actually haven't had map of the public

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:55,720
transportation system which again seems

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,570
maybe to be weird but it is actually the

00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,980
case in most cities in the world I would

00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,739
say that have a public transportation

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,880
system don't have necessarily data from

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,769
it

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,799
there's also study by World Bank that

00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:12,220
says 35% of the world's largest cities

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,620
have no map and 92% of those from low

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,320
and middle income countries so if we

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,570
look at Africa Latin America big parts

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,919
of Asia there is no such information and

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,660
we said hey we want to use those tools

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:29,159
OpenStreetMap in that case and we want

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:33,129
to get this data and do something out of

00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:34,960
so he took paper GPS devices this was

00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:39,849
the time before a lot of people had

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,789
smartphones with GPS chip sets in there

00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:46,419
and we started collecting the data of

00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:49,780
the bus roads and we did this in like

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:52,449
community building purpose so we trained

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:56,020
over 200 people that were interested

00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:57,729
everybody could join a lot of people

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,610
from universities professionals

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:02,229
government employees all kind of people

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,440
that wanted to learn we're welcome and

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:08,169
and we met just together and we created

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,770
the first actually public transportation

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:14,469
map of whole Central America and we

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:17,469
printed it we gave it to the people and

00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:19,960
later on we also created a digital tools

00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:25,419
like an online platform or a mobile

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:28,479
application for people so this is what

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:30,789
we can do right but what happens if not

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,500
only one could change that but we could

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,830
do it all together as we are doing with

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,229
open-source right and this with an Open

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,520
Street Map means that there are 1

00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:44,680
million people that have already

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:47,500
contributed to to this big database and

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,240
this it is a global initiative similar

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,029
to also to Debra and Debbie endive is

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,199
based in collaboration to create a free

00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:57,729
and open world map the map has of the

00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,020
data as a free license it's available

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:03,279
for everybody for any purpose and

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,159
everything that is added is going to be

00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,050
available it's not the perfect

00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,690
comparison I would say but definitely

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,029
one of the closest OpenStreetMap can be

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:17,020
titled like the wiki mean Wikipedia of

00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:19,089
maps especially because there's a very

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,900
low entry barrier so you can like

00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:25,599
literally as you can click on edit on

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,330
open so on on Wikipedia to add an

00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,159
article or to edit an article to improve

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,680
the data that is there information that

00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:35,770
is there you can click on edit on Open

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,840
Street Map and the website would flip

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,180
around and you get an edit

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,889
on this editorial you can add points

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:48,889
streets buildings you can improve the

00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:52,520
data and it is really very simple and

00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:54,680
everybody can do oftentimes

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,689
OpenStreetMap is seen as this website

00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,500
right that this open alternative to

00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:02,330
Google Maps I wanted actually to do this

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,580
this talk without mentioning this

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,050
company name but say okay and but

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,150
there's a big difference I think that

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,650
this is why I think there's no

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,479
comparison because one is a website

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,400
where you can do what the company allows

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,289
you to do and the other one is actually

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,009
you have a date you have the data set

00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:23,419
you can do everything with the data set

00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:25,520
the planet you can download the whole

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:28,669
planet of OpenStreetMap that's

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,310
compressed around 80 X uncompressed

00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:33,169
around a terabyte usually people

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,360
wouldn't not download the whole planet

00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:39,259
you would definitely take a subset of it

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:43,190
but it shows that actually it is by now

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:46,279
the largest enumeration of geographic

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,169
open Geographic data that we have and

00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,259
this is an extreme value and in a lot of

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:52,940
places you can either start from zero or

00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,800
you start with what you have of

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:58,909
OpenStreetMap which is already like a

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,849
lot of good work this data can be used

00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:04,279
in all kind of devices it can be styled

00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:06,770
the maps can look like you want them to

00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,589
look like you can use them in any kind

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:13,099
of application you can force them to

00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:14,870
different media's paper print you can

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:19,310
have them in mobile phones you can have

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:22,189
special devices in in trains or

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,750
something and I'm a big fan still of

00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:26,449
printed maps because they're just like

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,120
accessible you can use them and also in

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,729
our case where we work with governments

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,899
and of humanitarian organizations the

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:39,050
paper map has a big value for planning

00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:41,750
because of its immediate access we can

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,669
do online maps by the way this was one

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,600
of the first online map that I did was

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,650
the depth wealth map I'm still happy

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,010
that it's online

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,529
so so we can style them we can put

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,930
things on top we can really dig into the

00:08:54,529 --> 00:09:00,350
data and we can of course use this data

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,930
for geographic information systems which

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:09,560
is basically doing the professional work

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:12,230
with geo data now I want you to take not

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,860
that far from Nicaragua to Haiti you

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:19,640
probably remember the the big earthquake

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:22,310
in 2010 that's hit Haiti pretty strongly

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,080
and this is the poorest country in the

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,620
Americas and literally at that moment

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,890
when the foreign help organizations came

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,779
in but also the local governments when

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,850
they wanted to address those issues they

00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,650
had no geo information and they had no

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,620
way of dealing with that and they had a

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,420
problem with of giving water to the

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,570
people and to communicate where to get

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:47,060
water and this was before like

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,980
everything started on like humanitarian

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,990
work in OpenStreetMap but some people

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,820
said hey I want to help and they used

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,970
this OpenStreetMap that at that point

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,770
came at that point in time came like to

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,040
a level that it had an editor that it

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:03,140
was easy to do before it was like much

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,290
harder so they used it because they want

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:13,100
to help and therefore I have a little

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:16,400
visualization for you on the bottom left

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,220
you see the days and this is the map of

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,339
Haiti and you will see in colors the

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,950
edits that are happening on it so you

00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:28,190
can see I think on the 12

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:31,190
it's the earthquake and people start

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:34,130
mapping and within a few days there was

00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,529
already like some good information of

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,390
the city and within less than two weeks

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:40,600
there was a decent map of the whole

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,600
country

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:56,840
so they're famous before-and-after

00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:02,900
picture this is the showed progress in

00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:05,780
only 28 days and this could then be

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:09,770
immediately we used without any

00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:11,930
restrictions and restrictions and was

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,420
converted and could be used on devices

00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,310
and people were able to start like doing

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,070
first maps of telling people where they

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,660
get water this was the very beginning

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,220
there were a lot of issues you perfectly

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,020
know right you have a data set somebody

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:28,910
wants to use it within like three days

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,890
so but this way that's very started and

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,020
this is where some organizations were

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,000
founded with an Open Street Map one that

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,040
I'm working forced in one in the middle

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,640
and there are others there's Carter ng

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,730
and Lilly play sheriff they all doing

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:49,220
humanitarian work with Open Street Map

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:50,870
and we we started becoming better so we

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,950
need first we needed to coordinate right

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:57,520
and and we started creating tools that

00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:01,310
allowed us to work in bigger groups on

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:04,190
on data collection we also trained

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,100
organizations schools and companies to

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:10,010
conduct so called mapping parties or map

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:14,630
atones where people physically meet to

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:18,380
learn and map this time I want you to

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:21,350
take to West Africa where in 2014 was

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,540
this Ebola crisis and this was where you

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:28,040
already were kind of professionalized

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,930
right so the international organizations

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,000
asked us for data but now the pipeline

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,310
of actually having the data and

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,830
consuming the data was already set up in

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:39,650
Red Cross that was Without Borders and

00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,660
others so they had immediately access to

00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,190
this data and they could like say okay

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,830
there's something happening in a certain

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,810
area they could ask people to map it and

00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:52,130
then two days later they had it on the

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:53,780
ground to successfully combated bola its

00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,640
required to have the information on a

00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,700
house level because you want to know

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,890
where some case happens so you can send

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,040
your that infection teams to it and you

00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:06,399
probably wants to do some

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,800
yeah some some measuring some some means

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,360
on on on on the surroundings of this

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,920
place for this we created one software

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,889
it's called the tasking manager it's a

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,199
very simple principle it is basically

00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:22,720
you define a region that is of your

00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,309
interest and then it would cut

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,489
everything in like small pieces like

00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:29,199
these little squares and people can say

00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:30,639
I'm working on this I'm locking this so

00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:35,230
that nobody other works on it and we

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:38,589
don't have editing conflicts so usually

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:40,929
people select one place once one task

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:43,569
and then they start off of it with a

00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:45,610
satellite image this is how it works

00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:47,619
by the way when there's a disaster it's

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:51,879
sometimes easier to get satellite images

00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:53,709
tanned and regular times I would say we

00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:57,119
have like basic coverage but sometimes

00:13:53,709 --> 00:14:00,399
this is older if there are disasters

00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,790
sometimes there there are more people

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,529
willing to donate satellite imagery so

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:09,249
based on the satellite imagery people

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:12,699
can start drawing manually and and this

00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:16,119
is how it would look like to draw all

00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:17,980
the buildings in in a part of western

00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:20,290
Africa if I talk about western Africa

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:24,249
I'm in Sierra Leone Liberia and Guinea

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:27,910
and then this is the result of the

00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:30,399
remote mapping which is then vector data

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:35,259
that can be used in all kinds of

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,549
programs as I explained before and Waka

00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:38,920
doing Guinea am was one of like the

00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:40,749
critical epidemic centers where it

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,269
wasn't clear and then they spotted it as

00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:50,350
one of like the places where it's very

00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:54,730
urgent and within five days 250 around

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,350
250 mappers created this now like with

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,649
the experience and with all the tools

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:02,829
that are there and those this data was

00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:06,069
then used by the humanitarian

00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:08,679
organizations in total over the whole

00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:11,259
year of the Ebola crisis there were 200

00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,749
to 2,000 volunteers that participated in

00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:16,240
that and we probably created as a result

00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:18,550
of this not just addressing for

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,370
matera in action but also as a result

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,980
there was like the best map created of

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,600
western Africa

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,160
which by the way nowadays is used of

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:35,670
course for other purposes and that's

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:37,870
great here just like a small logo

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,670
introduction of like what are the

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:43,120
organization's we are working with there

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:45,670
are more this is just like the ones that

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,610
are more related to the to the examples

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,740
that I'm giving here and with those

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,050
organizations we were like seeing hey

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,850
but there are still so many places on

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,730
the world where we don't have geographic

00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,010
information so how do we do that

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:02,529
this is not energy consumption of the

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,899
world but it looks a little bit like

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,940
that actually here but this means where

00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:09,610
we have data in OpenStreetMap and if you

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,160
look at like India China where more than

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:16,270
3 billion people live there there should

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:20,529
be more interest rate at same for parts

00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:23,140
of Latin America and Africa of course so

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:25,390
we created this initiative called

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:29,560
missing maps where we want to put the

00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:31,649
most vulnerable places on the map why we

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,640
say the most vulnerable places because

00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:40,630
surprisingly there's a correlation that

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:43,000
oftentimes the places that don't have

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:50,079
geographic information are also the ones

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:52,750
that are hits worst by disasters missing

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,709
maps is definitely an arm-chair project

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:59,730
so people sits meet in my patents in

00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:02,230
austria like like you can see here or

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:06,040
sitting in the hall and then the comfort

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,420
of their home to to contribute but of

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,880
course we are doing map patterns

00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:13,750
everywhere in the world this is in

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:16,449
nicaragua again and we also go to places

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,579
where people have yeah and we learn

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:21,670
together and we also go to places where

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,490
people are learning with us too so we

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,819
even did am a patent and the white house

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:29,370
not with this president of course

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:33,210
and I think it's particularly

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:35,309
interesting because because everybody

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,530
who gets into OpenStreetMap has to learn

00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:40,110
and like seeing this like this

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:42,210
organizations and governments are like

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:47,309
catching up with learning what means

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:52,559
open is it's great to see I will come

00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:54,840
back to that later this is in German but

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,700
it's a placeholder for this video that I

00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,799
wanted to show you which is from Doctors

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,970
Without Borders and gives you like a

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:06,120
good impression of how the humanitarian

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:08,250
organizations now perceive the the

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,490
opportunities of street map can give

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,490
them

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:09,580
okay then we realized so of course we

00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:12,640
knew before but it is really important

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:15,940
to to highlight that remote mapping is

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:20,110
of course possible but it is not the

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:22,240
most suitable form of mapping it's from

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,890
satellite imagery you can see houses you

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,750
can see roads but you don't know whether

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,390
this imagery is from today or from

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,100
yesterday and if the house is still

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,940
there and of course you don't know the

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,740
names you don't know the the the

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,260
function the purpose of a building

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:41,530
whether there's a pharmacy or there's a

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:44,710
casino in there so from a from a data

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:47,890
perspective you need you need you need

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:50,890
definitely like local knowledge but I've

00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:53,140
but for me the knowledge is much more

00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,060
important in a way of I want to

00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,100
differentiate between information and

00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,230
knowledge when information is the

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,240
artifact and knowledge is something that

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,430
can only live in the head of a person

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,930
because it's like when the when

00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:09,970
information is processed by yourself and

00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:12,640
and this is really important for

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,190
OpenStreetMap because every place in the

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,170
world is different and also how we

00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:20,650
started we didn't start like with one

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:22,720
smart guy or girl that was saying hey we

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,090
have this data structure and now let's

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:30,670
stick to it we are like actually moving

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:32,980
as we are going and this is the local

00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:41,440
people are by default when we talk about

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:43,810
Maps they are the experts and this is

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,440
why it's so important to let them become

00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:50,590
part of the whole movement to explain

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,690
this a little bit more I want to give

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,250
you a little bit an introduction of how

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,250
the data structure works in

00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:01,090
OpenStreetMap so there are only three

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:03,540
types of data that are points lines and

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:07,480
relations and with this we can actually

00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:10,510
build up polygons lines that are related

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,370
or a polygon we can do of course all

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,220
streets and we can put points on it

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:19,539
those are classifies to fit simple

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:23,140
ak value pair or tech with key value

00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:25,200
pairs so for example here we have name

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,720
and the name in highway a classification

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,720
classification residential this is a

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,659
very volatile data structure because

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,520
there are no strict rules you can

00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:41,190
basically put everything in there and

00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:44,470
people put everything in there literally

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,990
we have a wiki so you can you we

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,960
organize ourselves of how we use and how

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:52,179
we formalize our data we do this through

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,720
the wiki we do this together we fight a

00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:58,299
lot of course we don't have a last

00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,309
instance that takes a decision so we are

00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:04,270
they are much flatter than for example

00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:06,850
even Wikipedia because really everybody

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,370
can edit and it is that simple and

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,900
there's no privileged role of being

00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,470
there for a longer time or something

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,000
like that we do have a police we have we

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,549
have a data working group those are like

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,600
three four five people they have almost

00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:27,130
nothing to do and we have a lot of lot

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,900
of people with very curious eyes looking

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:33,460
what people are doing so this is how we

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:35,380
do how we defend ourselves and of course

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,610
we have bots that look also for like

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:41,740
malignus edits so coming a little bit

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,320
back on this local knowledge i think

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,720
here it's it starts becoming clear or

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,520
why it is not just about the data it is

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,770
about the people that are taking part in

00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,380
this because we are constantly defining

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,059
the data structure and it's changing and

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,039
it's different in different countries

00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:01,470
maybe and it's different even in the

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:04,720
same country if two people have like a

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:08,799
different idea on how to do it in their

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,470
specific region for a specific topic and

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:15,789
we have to constantly deal out how we

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:19,030
have eve how we move forwards and and in

00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:20,919
this context is it is just like very

00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,020
interesting to see what are they like

00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,590
the particularities of OpenStreetMap in

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,990
comparison to other open-source projects

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:30,909
and I think here there's really

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,159
to see the low barrier that I've

00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:36,250
mentioned before of full of the full

00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:38,260
open contribution cycle so you can you

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,320
can enter everybody can enter you don't

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,880
have to be a full program or you you

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,490
people that are just curious can enter

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,460
click Edit they have there's a map that

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:50,950
put one point more on it and they saw

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,809
hey there was something I contributed

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,000
and I have something bigger that I got

00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:55,480
out of it this you can explain in one

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,179
minute

00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,700
to almost everybody with some visuals

00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:03,880
and by the way this was also the reason

00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,309
why Nicaragua that became popular

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,620
because we've really had the chance to

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:11,620
reach out to much more people outside of

00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:14,740
the bubble of our technical people

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,409
because because if it is clear it is

00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,630
very very obvious to people when it

00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:25,270
comes to visuals and when it comes to

00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:27,789
maps on the other side I think this is

00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:31,330
this is I recently got inspired by the

00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:34,840
by open knowledge foundation that were

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:37,690
like using those free components as like

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:42,490
successful components of an often of

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:44,559
openness of course the open data the

00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:48,279
data literacy that I think is oftentimes

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:52,860
not enough pushed ahead and this is what

00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:55,570
I was also meaning when I say knowledge

00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,940
and the tool the free software that's

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:00,909
that that allows you to actually deal

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,190
with the artifact and I think one

00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:05,710
particle of particularity of

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:10,659
OpenStreetMap is that those free are

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:13,299
somehow equal balanced and this also of

00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:17,950
course plays into the the possibility

00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:19,690
that more people are are like getting

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,580
into it and understands the cycle

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,169
because all three of them are there and

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:31,840
they fit into each other you could not

00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:35,320
take one piece out not at all and and

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,550
this is true I mention it before on the

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,360
on the world by air

00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,770
Whitehouse mapathon that we have we have

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,900
really gotten to a level of

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:47,240
collaboration that is huge

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,510
so we have a lot of craft mappers people

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,100
that want to do it

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:55,340
almost all Silicon Valley now uses

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,020
OpenStreetMap besides the big G because

00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,590
they already have the monopoly on their

00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,929
stuff development agencies and

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,210
organizations humanitarian organizations

00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:07,610
they all went into that and they all had

00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:11,450
to learn through that how to use open

00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:14,210
source and open data and and this is

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:16,820
nice to see that this is like happening

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:19,250
for all not just like for the people

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:22,280
that we see like that I get in the first

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:25,630
touch with technology but people that

00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:29,860
are that are like very huge but will

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,860
complain comply with these rules

00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:39,830
let's do quickly this last example which

00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:41,900
is which is in Tanzania where people are

00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:47,030
having a lot of problems of floodings

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:52,370
and and this has an effect on the health

00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:54,440
of the people so we were using another

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,840
tool which is open area map together

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,380
with open drone map that allows you to

00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,660
actually take yourself airborne imagery

00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:05,780
uploaded here and an open license and it

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:09,230
can be immediately used and again we

00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:14,240
created a wonderful map of the capital

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:19,130
of Tanzania together with students a

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:21,140
very local approach to that and this is

00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,540
very diverse a this is a very nice

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,260
success story because then they founded

00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:29,179
their own organization and they are now

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,980
spreading the world in the world and the

00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:35,570
knowledge around OpenStreetMap in

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:38,450
neighbor countries the data itself is

00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:41,840
used by the city administration for

00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:45,260
planning now so a lot of like work has

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,510
been doing and then getting closer to to

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,470
the authorities here and to improve the

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,090
situation which is of course

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:56,700
easier to do if you have a map to show

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:58,380
what's going on quickly you don't have

00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,870
to download the planet you can do

00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,020
queries there's an API for that I think

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:06,330
I don't have to go too deep into that if

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,970
you don't like API switch I don't expect

00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,140
in this room there's not an expert will

00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:12,750
where you can do this with clicking

00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:19,380
clicking important for some

00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:23,400
organizations and to finish just some

00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:26,640
last examples how this data can be used

00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:29,490
here Doctors Without Borders took the

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,950
buildings from OpenStreetMap based on

00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:34,470
this data they estimated the population

00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:37,409
in different areas and they knew how big

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:43,080
their back for vaccines needs to be if

00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:47,220
they go to certain places in the

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:51,929
Philippines which is highly exposed to -

00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:55,590
to tsunamis we developed in a safe which

00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:57,720
is a quantum GIS plug-in where you can

00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:01,020
run risk scenario so you can use the

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,030
data from OpenStreetMap you can say in

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:06,270
this case you combine it with a digital

00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:08,280
elevation model and you say okay if the

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,650
water comes up ten meters what happens

00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,590
and you can do this for planning and you

00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:17,130
can do this in the moment and of course

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:18,809
in those in those times you cannot do a

00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:22,830
talk without mentioning deep learning

00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:24,870
and and we do we do is we do some

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:27,030
experiments of it I mean really there we

00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,950
have to be very honest of what can be

00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,200
done some things that can be done as you

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,000
can try to estimate what is on there

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,950
under under images and then you can

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,690
compare it with OpenStreetMap data and

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,429
then you maybe have an idea of where

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,330
there's more work that needs to be done

00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:43,950
and where not

00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:46,080
this is so far how we have been going OS

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:49,080
m is a big ecosystem a lot of things

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,460
that don't they are not called OS m our

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,860
part of it so also a lot of work is

00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,230
happening in Debian we could not survive

00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,399
without aliens so thanks a lot also for

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,389
this good work

00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:06,359
and if you are interested you can always

00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:10,019
go to tasks that had always a mark and

00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:14,489
start mapping there's always good work

00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:16,080
needed there are links on how to map I'm

00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:20,159
happy to share the slides also

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:24,659
afterwards and there is a mailing list

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,809
if you are more into that thank you very

00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,809
much

00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:45,410
[Applause]

00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:48,140
I have two questions so if I got the

00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,910
process correctly the first step in if

00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,390
you are mapping in new areas to take

00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:55,760
satellite images and then later the

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:58,220
locals augment that data by adding

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,130
street numbers or sweetens or something

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:03,050
so the first question is how do we know

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:04,640
that the coordinates on the satellite

00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,230
images are actually correct so the

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,890
images are displaced by some meters

00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,900
because it's a slender area and the

00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,280
other question is once you've mapped the

00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,460
area how do you keep that data

00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,650
up-to-date like the new houses popping

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,260
up so are you looking at the satellite

00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:23,330
images again or how does that work okay

00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,150
and two very good questions because to

00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:31,820
both I don't have like a good answer the

00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:33,680
first one is the the alignment or miss

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,410
placement of satellite imagery we'd have

00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,870
to deal with this all the time so we see

00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:41,540
we have usually several sources and we

00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:43,940
see that they are not well aligned we

00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,980
have possibilities of aligning them also

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,380
in a community effort so you could like

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:52,000
in certain areas say this is an offset

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,000
like this this is an offset like that

00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:58,390
the whole tile like that then they are

00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:03,380
working in tiles yes it would it would

00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:05,810
it would correct that of course this is

00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:09,590
why we need people on the ground we need

00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:12,230
GPX stay town or like GPS exported a

00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:15,020
town that we can combine so we can see

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,600
this this line is the street and then if

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:19,940
it's the satellite images there we start

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,890
like moving it there but I have to say

00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,950
it never fits hundred-percent

00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:28,000
it's always an approximation and

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:35,830
sometimes it is also like it is off for

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:38,090
some meters and the second question

00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,920
keeping the data up-to-date keeping the

00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,930
data up-to-date we are still there if we

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,030
try to get all the data but we are

00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:47,840
already anticipated keeping it up to

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,700
date is actually more work than then

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,370
building it because if you have an empty

00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,440
paper it's easy to to write something on

00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,360
it or to fill it but if it's already

00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,240
full it's stiff more difficult to find

00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:02,750
which is not good anymore

00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,060
I say the only solution for this is

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,620
actually local communities that have an

00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,170
interest because if you're living in a

00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,610
place you're verifying constantly and

00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:17,750
you're you have an interest in keeping

00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:19,490
this data up to date yes I started doing

00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,120
him a long time ago and recently did

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,950
some hot

00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,180
mapping which was great fun terribly

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:27,830
terribly addictive it's really dangerous

00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,360
to work so you guys I can call this work

00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:32,660
brilliant so I did like two weeks of

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:36,170
nothing else but the biggest problem I

00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:38,120
found was the the dating of different

00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,410
aerial views so you know in the middle

00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,000
of West Africa you've got different

00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,560
satellite vintages and I found it very

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,450
hard to work out which was nearer when

00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,280
they're not the same and does that

00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,770
metadata exist is there an easy way to

00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,750
find out or is it just hard not really

00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,690
it is just hard we would like to have

00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:56,030
better like there's one problem on

00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,860
having suitable metadata on satellite

00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,690
imagery which is sometimes still hard

00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,880
because the providers are not doing

00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,250
that's in a way that we would like just

00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,040
to have of course we would like to have

00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:12,020
much more open imagery but it's very

00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:16,100
expensive so yeah this it is reading

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,810
asking looking sometimes even the

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,760
providers have like you scroll a little

00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:23,210
bit to the side and it's another year

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,550
then it is there it is

00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,700
it is tough yeah we definitely don't

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:31,480
have a perfect situation on sources for

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,480
satellite imagery

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,250
so nobody has any questions anyone of

00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:53,730
this thank physics again

00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:53,730
