okay next up is goodnight I was going to

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:10,490
talk about a PGP key ring and what we

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,820
can learn from it thank you very much

00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:17,609
but a first of all I've been working on

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,240
this and this information well more or

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,550
less

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,250
started doing it for fun because well as

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,689
part of what we did a in curing

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,650
maintainer led me into into start

00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:33,480
wondering how does how how does our

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,090
snapshot of reality look like so this

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,690
this is not don't take it as something

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,370
seen to to be improving the area or even

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,309
you can even see this as something that

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,200
was made by an outsider and not that I

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,809
am an outsider but that the view I'm

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,629
taking here is well I'm objectively

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,750
looking up at whatever information I can

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,460
gather from from the keyring and trying

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,600
to explain some bits about it

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,329
a the thing is we start the work that

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,299
started me going on this is what we did

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,840
in depth at comfort in that that's when

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:14,220
we kicked off what they became the the

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:22,680
immigration to strictly greater than 24

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:25,170
bit to a 2024 bit a kiss em because well

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:32,400
there were security liability by then

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:34,560
and a well a start showing this first

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,619
with the graphs who we use then this is

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,650
a graph that that we showed two years

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,110
ago showing well how it was taking so

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,890
long for us to migrate away from short

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:51,210
kiss a you can see several well of the a

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:54,210
most likes a responsive people did the

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,689
switch here at first but then the the

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,729
the trend was very slowing going down we

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,310
were very happy that we were almost at

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:06,299
the point of crossing in fact I think we

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,250
we crossed during that month but the

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,580
trench showed we would take at least

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,580
three four five more years to do the

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,830
final

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,800
it changes and of course that would

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:21,040
become flatter and flatter over time so

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,720
well that's what what prompted us to to

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,390
do an aggressive change a it was quite a

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,540
lot of work for us I mean not that we

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,910
didn't know it but a through through

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:39,310
less than half a year than half a year

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:42,160
we replaced over 250 keys and we were

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,960
happy with the result I think although

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,170
we did have problems in the end because

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:51,220
for example close to 1/4 of the project

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:53,230
lost access to well both uploading of

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,290
voting voting rights because they are

00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:00,130
expressed well through having a valid

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,800
key right and they will 18 months you

00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:08,440
know yeah 18 months later 200 degrees

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:10,510
still have not a transition to a valid

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,820
key so they are effectively effectively

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,630
locked out of most of their project

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,080
rights right

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:23,800
this is say how well how the keyring

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,970
looks like the the Debian developer

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:33,459
uploading kiwi keyring so well yeah the

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:36,340
this slope was was very abrupt and of

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,370
course we have managed to to gain back

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,860
these bits that that we have a lost by

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,290
then but well this prompted me into

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:48,239
looking at this semi information in

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:51,130
different ways this is fun to get but I

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,470
wanted to understand a bit more than

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,230
what social interactions can I get from

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,590
looking at the file we have so currently

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:04,090
as of well not today but while I was in

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:06,489
the plane we have 816 a valid keys for

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,010
Debian developer uploading and well I'm

00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,280
focusing on those of course I mean

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,959
because they're like representative

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,820
Debian maintainer czar a very different

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,560
case but I'm not going into them I'm

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,590
sorry for you because of time

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:24,070
constraints I have not digged into that

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:26,050
one and we don't hold maintainer such

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,419
like a source of trust

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,180
so there is a difference and non

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,280
uploading there so so few that I am sure

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,990
that they I mean I'm looking at them

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,840
separately because we keep them in

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,490
separate directories but it would not

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,430
strongly influence anything I'm almost

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:46,720
sure okay

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:51,580
so I didn't decide not to stop there and

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:55,479
they started say trying to draw the the

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:58,330
data set we have so a well what is the a

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:01,599
strong set defined they related to a

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,879
keyring is the the largest set of the

00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:07,379
keys that from each of them you can

00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:10,990
reach all the others yeah there's like a

00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:13,690
looser definition that a I'm not using

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,919
that's the reachable set so if you have

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:20,020
somebody who cannot reach back via a

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,120
trust relationship but can be reached is

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,370
an original set but not in the strong

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,960
set the strong set is all connected they

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:33,039
like you can trace the trust paths

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,759
between all of them and this is the well

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:40,090
the first thing I measured some months

00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,219
ago is how much the the proportion of

00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,520
the strong set very regarding to the

00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:47,400
total number of keys I I was supposing

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,969
that we would lose a lot of connectivity

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,039
by doing the the rollover to larger kiss

00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:56,979
and of course we had some interesting

00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,590
jitter here we started here with the

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:02,440
migration and but the lowest point we

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,800
had I mean this is say this starts at 70

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:09,669
the lowest we we had was 82% reach

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,690
ability the highest is 89 and we were

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:16,000
like at 88 and reached 89 here we of

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,599
course here was the lowest point ever

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,860
I'm going to explain why very shortly

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:28,449
but it was said in some way expectable

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:34,240
right I'm sorry for relaying IRC over

00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:36,789
here but was okay so how did i graph the

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,410
rest well I use graph Lee's why did I

00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:41,480
use graph miss a today I

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,940
it may not not have been the greatest

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,330
choice gravis is a great tool for

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:50,810
simpler diagrams but it's not meant to

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:53,900
to track a set of a set of keys that

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,120
change over time so what's here like

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,710
this it will be like that in the next

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,110
one because each graph is unique and

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,020
they don't control or at least I haven't

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:06,830
dug enough to to control the the

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:09,560
algorithm that positions things and also

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:13,310
when dealing with large amounts of nodes

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,560
and edges it becomes just too slow yeah

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,470
in this computer for example this is a

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,900
very low end laptop it takes about 10

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:24,020
seconds to generate each snapshot and

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:27,170
I'm generating about 300 snapshots if

00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,230
when I'm doing it fully okay of course

00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:34,070
the first thing I did is to grab the

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:37,340
keyring it's beautiful it's boring if

00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:40,850
you have this I mean it's just a blob

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:44,360
yeah it has some spikes but I asked a

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:48,170
friend who works in a well in psychology

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,400
sociology field what do you want me to

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:54,680
do with it it's useless because

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,650
analyzing social graphs deals with small

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,530
bits of it smells small pieces so I can

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,230
I mean yeah here I have some say here

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,180
you see some isolated and some Island

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,860
some people that are not connected well

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,570
which are not in the strong set or

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,340
things like that but this doesn't tell

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,280
me anything

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:17,300
but this is a recent photo for for us

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,450
right but the thing is as I generated a

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,480
graph for each tag that means for each

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:26,230
upload we did for dish each quick push I

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,630
found some that were like this right

00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:32,660
something very strange for me this is

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:36,110
from before just before we started the

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,660
transition so the transition didn't get

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,530
effect but you can see here it's

00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:46,430
something that's splitting in half and

00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:48,260
well it got me scratching my head yeah

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,680
what does this split mean why does it

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,850
appear where does it come from why is it

00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:00,770
there

00:08:52,850 --> 00:09:04,160
so I a a I took several snapshots well

00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:09,310
this is generally I mean the top row is

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:12,010
more or less each year 2010 late 2010 a

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:16,220
1213 I'm sorry the months are in Spanish

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:18,650
and here you see how it was well it's

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:24,140
hard to see maybe a in this resolution

00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:28,360
it was a blob then by early 2012 you

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:31,490
start seeing a group separating and by

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:36,110
2014 it was very obvious and this is

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,940
when we started actually a the Democrats

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,840
oh these group starts getting smaller

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,910
and smaller and by the end when this is

00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,150
December this is the last time we had

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:51,020
the short kiss so what we effectively

00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:56,000
cut away was just a small portion and by

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:59,480
here well a you that group disappeared

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,090
so I started trying to understand what

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:08,380
that was so I came up with an hypothesis

00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:11,360
that something related to curing aging a

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,170
the thing is we are a long-running

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,690
project and the GPG has been well PGP

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:24,980
which GPG is an implementation of open

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:28,100
PGP a a PGP has been a constant trait of

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,320
the project for a very long time not for

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,650
all the project history but says in the

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:40,550
late 90s at least we don't have the

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:42,620
history for the first years but a the

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,800
the social interactions that happened

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,530
over 10 years ago may may be getting

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,260
lost or maybe falling away

00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:55,610
because those people well it's logical

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:58,850
that are having new interests may may

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:04,990
not remain connected say for some few

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:04,990
cases M

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,389
so I tried to get the graphs colored

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,060
took me a long time to get this straight

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:16,430
because my script were so so so badly

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,459
written that it took six minutes to

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,560
generate each each one of them when when

00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,389
or something like that when I rewrote

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,880
the script in a much simpler way which

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:29,269
are ugly and I don't want to show them I

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,389
will show them at I'm sure but a it took

00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:35,690
me like a hundred times less so I was

00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:38,779
very happy so I made these next graphs

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,870
with blue for less than one year green

00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:43,550
one to two yellow up to three orange up

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,649
to four and red over four year old and

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,589
I'm graphing the edges only the

00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:50,779
signatures I'm ignoring self signatures

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:52,940
and I am ignoring the keys because here

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:55,190
they they are not of much value by

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,069
themselves right well it doesn't look

00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:03,170
very nicely it looks very different than

00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:05,750
my screen but you can see that this was

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:09,319
the curing before the immigration so yes

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:12,170
this whole blob was a red thing this all

00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:15,160
were very old signatures over five year

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:20,420
old and here we have a lively community

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:23,569
today this is well in June we have

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:26,600
several old key all signatures in our

00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:29,180
living keyring but it's all fooled of

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,269
different colors it's all mixed that

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,170
means I I understand that in that means

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:41,149
that many well my for cakey I started

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:43,430
using it in in 2009 and many other

00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:46,490
people started by but by that year as

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:49,990
well so we got it connected and our

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:52,670
signatures will remain in because

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,370
because they well they are between two

00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:59,569
values keys so I I did the same thing we

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:02,329
had before and yes the the red blob of

00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:04,850
course the the colors are relative to

00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:07,699
the moment I took the snapshot so if

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:11,000
this was what I don't have I can see the

00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:15,170
dates here but this was early 2010 the

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,560
red signatures are before 2006 right em

00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,250
and the it does follow this same pattern

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,070
we

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:25,430
a large body of very old signatures that

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:28,010
were slowly being like pushed away by

00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:32,270
people retiring or by people slowly

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:34,940
migrating to new yorkese so this is more

00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:39,200
or less this more or less conceit with

00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:44,480
this yeah here and here and this is well

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:49,910
a much more often during a 2014 where we

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:53,620
see this split so well yes in the end

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:56,510
what happens here is that there is a

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,460
body of all signatures that weren't

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,620
socially integrated with the rest of the

00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,540
group and as the rest of the group

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,940
migrated away from their old keys

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,300
started becoming a separate group until

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,430
while they were cut away it seems to

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,270
confirm what I initially thought I

00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:17,750
haven't really really checked a each

00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:20,630
case of them but what seems to be so hey

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:24,170
I know that and we will talk about this

00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,850
I mean in the next session that some of

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:29,360
us are going to be in that's like

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:34,220
explaining bits of what the key signing

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,860
is and how to do it a signing a key

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,500
doesn't mean I trust you as a person it

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,810
just means I trust that at a given point

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,980
in time the person I'm talking with and

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:49,310
I had somehow identified a hault control

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,290
of a given key a it's an important

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:54,320
measure of trust for us because we don't

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,810
get to meet every day not everybody gets

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,870
to me that that comes not everybody goes

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:02,030
to the average they've come so we we do

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:07,370
need this as a bit of accountability to

00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:10,730
real-world threats and this is the only

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:13,670
bit that links our electronic activity

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:16,130
to a physical identity and well I hope

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,320
we don't need it but in case when we we

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,930
needed to find who did something that's

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,330
the only way we have so how long should

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,300
this trust last I am starting to

00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,550
advocate here for expiring our

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,860
signatures when I sign your keys I

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,870
should do it in a way that the signature

00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,950
lasts for as long

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:38,930
I recognize your face a day of course I

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,180
don't know how how long I will remember

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,330
you but I can sign for example I'm

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:47,089
trying to start signing for 3 years and

00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:50,360
probably after sometime I will start

00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:52,700
checking well of the people I already

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,560
know I haven't this list who I still

00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,860
remember who they are who who are not

00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,580
and I can renew my trust on them without

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:04,010
having to to meet again it's just as if

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:07,580
I were following a transition statement

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:13,940
but train by myself right if you see

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:16,160
this way so how would this look if we

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,560
were to expire by default we are not

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,740
going to do this but well we have a

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,490
Kriya toriel process a creation means

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:31,300
say in an Museum exhibit an artist

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:34,670
brings a whole lot of works right and

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,130
the museum creator says well I want this

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,930
one here this one here those ones I

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,060
don't want so we do more or less the

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,300
same that's the what keyring maintainer

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:49,370
z' do a from the hall available keys in

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:53,800
the universe well we we form what

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:57,560
keyrings are meaningful to the VN so

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,510
what if we started expiring old

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,000
signatures and didn't treat them a solid

00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:06,250
we are not going to reach do they say I

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,439
mean we talk this and it's not like our

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,209
policy and will not be but it's an

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,689
exercise I'm playing right

00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:17,120
M how many people would fall of the

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:19,280
strong or the rich huddle sets if we

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,480
were to discard the old signatures or

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:28,220
how much would the keyring change there

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:32,990
change its shape so if we were talking

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:35,720
six years ago and expired a kids that

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:38,270
were older than five year old then I

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,400
mean this is this is the fourth the

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,040
snapshot I showed you before and this is

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,780
how it would look if we were discarding

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,990
and I'm sorry well we don't have a

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,850
better

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,490
resolution here you can see there's

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,890
noise her out here because those are

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:57,390
dots those are dots that are no longer

00:17:52,890 --> 00:18:00,179
connected to be honest I I didn't get

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,400
the exact numbers here you have more

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,880
dots because there are more disconnected

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,150
people but they are just smaller so so

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,580
we don't see them one of the details of

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:16,140
graph means that I didn't really control

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:19,559
a but the thing is I did write down how

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:24,450
many signatures are being expired so

00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:28,500
here we have a a over six thousand

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:35,910
signatures a that were no longer taking

00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:39,300
into account right and well what I get

00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:44,780
from here is that the resulting sets are

00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:49,620
very similar to those sets like after a

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:53,880
- what happens after a we we have to

00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:59,910
remove these keys that were smaller

00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:04,740
those older right again I know I have to

00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:07,950
do some a lot of more a lot more numbers

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:16,980
on this but well this is as far as I've

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:18,900
got so well a I can later show you show

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,679
you whoever's interested a better

00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,540
resolution a form of this I intend to

00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,200
make this all available

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,480
well my talks are already in the annex

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,390
but the the the graphs are higher

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,059
resolution than what I use for the PDF

00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:40,040
so whoever's interested please contact

00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:45,480
me and I intend to publish this all a

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:47,850
now how can we ask a jpg to stew to sign

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,730
with an expiry date that's something

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:55,070
that not that's not very common it's I I

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:59,510
haven't seen this advocated yet please

00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,510
please microphone yeah

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,330
if you'll talk about the seconds maybe

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,650
never mind but when I looked into these

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,020
features I found there was no way for

00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,059
GPG to ignore the expired certifications

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,840
and I wonder if you have found a way to

00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:25,820
ignore them and I haven't searched for

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:28,429
it eh you can you can filter from your I

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:32,240
yeah I want to write some scripts to

00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:36,200
help you like filter your stats and and

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,720
get the get what needs to be refreshed

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,890
but you know I haven't found a way to

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:48,440
well discard this information right

00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:53,840
so a GPG has an option that's ask cert

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:56,690
expire right and we can set it a well by

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,510
hand when when we call the GPG binder

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:02,330
itself or we can set it in our GPG that

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:06,799
comes just if we do remember that tools

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:09,260
such as CAF usually have a second GPG

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,659
configuration we will go into in the

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,630
other session into a like brief

00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:18,500
explanation of what CAF is and how does

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:22,610
it work remember to do it from the you

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:28,820
today the tools you use to to generate

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:31,159
the signatures okay this I went on on a

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,679
different path just to understand again

00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,440
how this goes on and there's a lot of

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,380
work I have not yet finished and I

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,080
intend to keep working on this direction

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,150
right what's this about isometric

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,610
signatures well we were talking what

00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:50,960
other things should I look for

00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:54,620
so a symmetric key signing a we usually

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,919
meet in pairs and I check your identity

00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:01,250
you check mine we exchange fingerprints

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:06,350
and we sign each other's key so but but

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:08,390
it it has happened it has happened to me

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:12,110
a couple of times in the past that I get

00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:14,120
a meal like this right oh okay my my

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:17,179
he was in the Deaf config his signing

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,700
party a keyring but hmm in the end I

00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:22,280
didn't when I didn't go to Def Con so

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:26,360
you didn't meet me but you still sign my

00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:28,790
key yeah well it happened to me I don't

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:35,690
know I hope nobody else ever got such a

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:37,549
mail eh but eh okay so so I looked for

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,559
how many signatures do we have that are

00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:42,230
only in one direction of course this

00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:44,900
does not mean that all of them are are

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:48,410
result of sloppy practices sometimes

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,540
well I don't have a passport on me and I

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,840
meet with somebody and well I decide I

00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,760
will sign their signature but their

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,520
fingerprint but they they don't have to

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,860
sign mine because they didn't check my

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,919
identity or whatever we don't have to

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,450
have a really matched group as long as

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,780
we have a strong said that's enough but

00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:12,320
I still did this oh it doesn't even show

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:17,480
there's a blob of red on top of this eh

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:21,650
so here I graphed again over time eh how

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:24,860
how many the red lines mean signatures

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:28,220
that are in one direction only and well

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:31,630
I don't have much more data than this

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:35,960
single number I can tell you it was

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:38,929
around 26% and over time it has kept

00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:42,500
basically constant I have I didn't even

00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:45,230
graph it like like a single line but I

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:49,010
can tell you that well it was 25.8

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:59,570
percent in 2010 twenty seven point two

00:23:49,010 --> 00:24:04,460
in 2012 20 7.17 in 14 now it's at 24 36

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:09,320
and well it doesn't vary it much it's in

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:12,350
average twenty six point six and well

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,919
that that may just mean that it doesn't

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:19,040
mean anything but that's like one of the

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,380
checks I'm a I'm doing I want to play as

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,980
well I think I have here like the

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,920
further ideas here a there are many

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,530
other things I

00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,830
I want to start doing with this again

00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:33,540
this has in fact you could say this this

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,000
has nothing to do either with

00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:38,730
cryptography or with security or with

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,400
Debian itself I'm just taking a set of

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:44,340
data that maps us all and try to

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,290
understand what else does it map what

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,330
can I understand from it right which

00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:52,830
algorithms were used were used for

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:55,350
signatures because well that that also

00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:58,560
can say well I want to discard all

00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:01,220
signatures done with sha-1 or if if we

00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,430
still have anywhere c5 I doubt we do

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,880
right

00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:07,650
how many islands do we or would we have

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,350
a where we to have some change for

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:13,230
example this is an island this is the

00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:16,110
definite proof that debian is satanic

00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:21,030
for a long time we had this five-point

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:23,610
island floating around yeah a it was

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:30,870
there for most of 2014 and well it's

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:32,940
gone now it we absorbed it how many

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:36,720
islands are there what's their shape or

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:39,810
for example do some some further guess

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,820
guesswork like what what's the minimum

00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:45,570
degree of connectedness for example to

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:49,530
to migrate a key to replace a key for

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:52,470
for any developer we require a the neo

00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:55,500
key to be signed by two people so we we

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,950
can avoid impersonation impersonation

00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,390
attacks two people should certify this

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:04,680
these key belongs to the person who

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:06,300
previously held the other key a so what

00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,570
would be the minimum degree of

00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,930
connectedness to consider say a key or a

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:16,650
group as belonging to a strong set maybe

00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:19,020
we do have some inner boundaries I don't

00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:23,240
know I don't think so but I'd like to

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:26,310
check a bit first right eh-eh

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,830
identifying main hubs say I know that I

00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:33,570
am quite well-connected what happens if

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:35,190
we extract my key say I retire so my key

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,170
is no longer in the keyring how much

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,730
does the connectedness of the keyring

00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,920
suffer how many people how many how

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,780
would we have to remove to create a

00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:48,580
divide or things like that

00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:51,610
uh-huh and well whatever ideas say we

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,670
can come up with starting with this set

00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:57,850
right again I don't know how this

00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:00,880
besides this idea I'm trying to push to

00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,679
to expire our signatures I'm not sure

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,500
this is really contributing to the

00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,809
abbien but rather using the VNS source

00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,299
of information but well I'm very happy

00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:16,750
you were here interested in what I have

00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:19,480
to say as for this conference well this

00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:22,450
is a graph of the of the key signing

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:27,970
party keyring we have it doesn't say

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:31,540
much and again well they a projected on

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:34,570
screen a the resolution doesn't give us

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,460
many many features but say we have here

00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,010
some floating kids those are most

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,830
important to get signed most important

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:44,980
to get connected with the rest of us who

00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:47,890
is safe here away this person is clearly

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,230
in the in the reachable but well it's

00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:55,480
most probably in the regional but not in

00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:57,400
the strong reg set right because I think

00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,230
you can reach here but not back or the

00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,720
other way around

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:08,200
I'm not sure I mean and a many of you

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:10,110
saw that from this from this map I I

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,880
generated also a personal one

00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,730
personalized where each person and

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:30,730
they'll open it

00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:31,720
well a each of us pain pain I think I

00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:35,110
don't have it here

00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:38,760
well anyway it's it's on my people

00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:41,830
Debian org thingy and I I mailed it so

00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,380
yeah you can check how does the keyring

00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:47,380
look from your perspective who is

00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:49,410
connected to you it you can check for

00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:52,140
the posting in

00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:56,340
in the Deaf Kampf discos list I said it

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:58,830
recently and well this is a point that

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,860
an evil requested me to do I think it's

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:05,190
important although here we cannot really

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:08,160
check this I'm I just show here how I

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,350
got to this number we're going to do and

00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,870
I'm not going into details on on this

00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:15,000
key signing party that we're doing right

00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:19,410
now because it's the subject of the next

00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:24,300
session I we will have but from this URL

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:29,070
I got the list of participants to the to

00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:34,470
the key signing party and if any of you

00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:35,940
have a their lucky number first if you

00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:40,140
don't have the lucky number that's very

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,810
bad for you because it's not a I mean we

00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,450
will not start at the same time it's

00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:47,940
very important that before doing any key

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:53,490
signing you check this is the shot 255

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:55,830
some of the of course of course check

00:29:53,490 --> 00:30:01,290
that your key matches what Sunday thingy

00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:05,010
on the file and check that this ish I

00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:12,630
assume matches the the one on the on the

00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:15,660
document itself and and and well

00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:20,430
basically that that's it for what I have

00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:23,630
prepared yeah please I have we have some

00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,630
questions and we have some microphones

00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:33,720
I fear the questions because I don't

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,800
have answers will make sense

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,840
two rare sign signatures I mean like

00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:43,380
every like three years I will sign your

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,080
signature I I think so yeah I think that

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,120
if I sign your key now but I don't see

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,730
your face for the next three years I

00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,550
will let that signature expire because I

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:56,340
will not remember you probably but if I

00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:58,980
keep seeing you I will sign by myself at

00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,620
home looking who is expiring I will see

00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,620
you and I will remember who you are if I

00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:08,460
or we can meet again for the express

00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:10,650
purpose of key signing so yeah I think I

00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:16,560
mean resigning people who you are

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:20,640
already signed should be done I very

00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:22,800
much like your proposal to set an expiry

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,080
date on signatures so they'll acts if

00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,300
they get renewed so I wonder if I should

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,910
revoke all signatures I have made and

00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:32,610
then issue new ones for people who are

00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:38,400
in that time and from now on issue time

00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:40,710
looted ones if we lots of us followed

00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,810
that policy that's going to cause quite

00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,930
a change in the graft using that

00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:47,610
sensible thing to do are we going to get

00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,280
ourselves into trouble by breaking lots

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:52,950
of those links very quickly well there

00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,470
are the realities it's very hard to know

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:58,980
I picked three years because I know my

00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:01,170
my attention span assay is a low but

00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:11,610
that was the reason I did the let me see

00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:15,800
if I have this here no I mean I know I

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:18,990
wrote no but yeah I reset this now I

00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:23,520
deleted it from here and it's only in my

00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:27,300
in my main work machine I think from

00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:29,160
well from the runs I did expiring over

00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:33,110
five year old keys that it doesn't make

00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:37,770
that much of a difference but of course

00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:40,140
all of the red blob fell away so but but

00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:43,770
those were

00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:48,150
in the end those were Mia candidates so

00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:50,180
a it's her it's hard to know I have to

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,860
play more with the information and

00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:55,650
probably start using better tools to do

00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:59,520
it because I'm really really doing it by

00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:02,190
hand and that doesn't scale so you sort

00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:06,330
of begin in that about 200 people that

00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:08,160
lost their key hadn't haven't sent a new

00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,950
one you think that means those people

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,860
are missing in action and do you think

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:17,070
they should have their accounts removed

00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,990
well I started talking with we we

00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:25,710
started talking with some of the people

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:30,830
in India me a team and they were they

00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:34,140
said well okay a last time we talked

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,820
they said well give us the list of

00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,650
people to start contacting the thing is

00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,590
there are too many people to contact I

00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:43,290
think many of them will be missing many

00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:45,990
of them will be willing to retire many

00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:48,140
of them are not we know of some people

00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:52,200
who have been trying to get reconnected

00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:55,650
I will be willing to possibly make make

00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,800
some concessions but it's hard to it's

00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:01,760
hard to say a I say concessions and

00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:05,100
Jonathan starts looking at me different

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,660
so clarity in the meantime just in cases

00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,280
any doubts those people who have been

00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,320
removed do not stop being Devine

00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,480
developers damn core not doing removals

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,030
at this stage will follow the normal mi

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,960

00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:24,419
