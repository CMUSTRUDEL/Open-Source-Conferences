okay so anyways thanks all to coming to

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:13,530
this stuff and I need to find some power

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,700
for my laptop first so I said before I'm

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,560
not giving a presentation

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,140
I'm not holding this off via having up

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,820
off together on the Debian policy so

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,140
everyone who wants to move close and

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,609
it's very very come true because it's

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,500
really something we don't do together

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,080
not something I'm speaking you can you

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,009
can you can whatever work on your laptop

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,309
instead on something else so basically

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,649
by the divided I schedules that puff we

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,710
have the Debian policy which is let's

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,379
say hair spinnin and not to good

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,910
maintenance status however I think it

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,789
since I found a pen or even before I

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,440
can't say about before it had a few good

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,329
times where things were working on

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,160
basically there lots of things which

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,739
should be done in policy we could look

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,739
at a buck list in the Debian policy so

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,809
basically what happens if some want some

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,670
change in policy mostly and adjustment

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,549
to what we're actually doing they should

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,140
report it by a BTS people should second

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,960
it and if an a second that should be

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,030
incorporated so things are berkeley

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,380
sometimes working up to the stage of

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,570
things are suggested a few have even

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,000
techniques but since a bit a bit of time

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,009
again as a basic after sickness nothing

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,220
happens and what i would like to get

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,689
from this out from this buff is really

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,280
certificated done again at least for

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,829
another to whatever towards the years we

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,290
can have another province ears so set

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,540
will be my plan of this puff and I'm

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,390
happy that at least a few people came

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,400
here and so my question is what could we

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,220
do to improve our AP and policy

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,079
processes to get it working again it is

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,820
a loop in my opinion if other planes of

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,409
peace should speak about I should be I

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,759
think we should discuss it now it's

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:58,340
begin of support so anyone anyone would

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,340
like to get to say something here

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:09,000
and you get anyone who wants to speak

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:11,160
it's a microphone first of all um I have

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,320
been lobbying for it for a while so I'm

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,230
glad you're doing it I've been speaking

00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,910
to bras Albury who is also a policy

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,010
maintainer and he said there were

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,590
already a lot of changes that presumably

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:26,820
was hat three acts and just had to be

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,550
written up and committed so basically I

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,670
guess what we need is some way of making

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,100
this happen and some of this I presume

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,790
will end up being basically we're having

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,410
enough committees for the policy team a

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,600
little two things have already said lots

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,310
of about now say just Grantville

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,140
quatrain has who needs to be done it's a

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,270
it's a patch which is most acceptable

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,120
perhaps except formatting or so which

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,500
isn't a hard taking a decision to do

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,019
it's a policy listen a bit early so

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,630
basically even as of today any would

00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,459
code clones you get the make for a kid

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,510
from our patrons of it and say here are

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,120
my whatever

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,950
twenty bucks I've closed and I'm very

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,570
happy to apply any of the patches which

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,660
seems reasonable enough and have a pack

00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,070
and yeah so I mean it's even easier

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,440
sponsoring that kind of things and

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,380
normal technicians upload so and happy

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,320
to sponsor any policy additions and I

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,170
mean if to Baxter remain open which are

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,019
more difficult it's not an issue for me

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,209
to whatever I have a discussion about it

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:30,000
but I really think what we should to do

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,070
is get rid of easy ones which we are not

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,720
doing so I'm totally agreeing on that

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,640
and as such as a good two three and

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:46,370
everyone could have access to circuitry

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:50,540
so any more people needing power good so

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,540
other others

00:03:54,020 --> 00:04:02,850
yep hi um I guess I'd like to delve in I

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,750
think you've oversimplified the policy

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:08,400
process in a way that I understand but

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:13,260
there's a part of it that is I think

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:17,299
important to remember going forward I'm

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:21,120
Pete speaking with my piece he had on as

00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:23,100
someone who may you know from time to

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,390
time get called on to to look at whether

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,640
the process is working well when you

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,980
second a policy proposal you're doing

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,410
two things and I'd like us to remember

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,800
both of them mm-hmm the first is you're

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,130
saying I think this proposal looks good

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,380
the second is you're also saying

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,580
according to the the polity the process

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,300
document you guys have written for your

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,540
internal years that I've reviewed this

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,750
process the the process and people have

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,240
had a chance to discuss it and any

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,970
objections have been handled so when

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,430
your second a bug you're not just saying

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,950
I think it's good you're saying we've

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,260
done a job of listening to all the

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:10,470
people who have concerns basically

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:13,110
second imposable posted means I think

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,720
the Debian community has decided I could

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,810
sing Turtles not just eyes decided but

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,540
but I think that'd be another yeah very

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,410
important if a second it means I

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,110
personally I'm convinced Debian

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,510
community has done this decision so yes

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,550
but I'm actually about getting from both

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,230
whole source of seconds isn't the thing

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,820
that I liked him too apparently because

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,620
I've become on always say there's a

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,180
proposal and we don't get the second

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,010
visit a certain time which has to

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,810
checked it so that's easier once the

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,720
thing is really what do we do so

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,240
basically how do we clear up secure and

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,980
how do we get on this proposal who have

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,200
a health Knox enough seconds and already

00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,070
are just easy to implement if I don't

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,630
get implemented

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,850
I mean for the heartworms where they

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,380
have fights over we will find out

00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,300
something inverse because we did me

00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,280
every defer to the committee so I think

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,740
that's all or not not what really all

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,360
this me but I mean if I look at the

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,250
committee list since as the same people

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,210
who can fight for it as applies in

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,830
Debian and I

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,180
don't think one of us is going to do it

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:15,060
to work on Z let's say yeah the normal

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,560
policy patches we're all happy to work

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,979
on the hot ones but in terms of normal

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,990
ones

00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,460
so my question asked is there someone

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,070
here who has interested in doing that

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,110
how do we get people for that and the

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,900
other proposes how we could could do it

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,419
better to be require for example anyone

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,900
who like to get a policy - a proposal in

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:38,389
to submit things in the kit format patch

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:41,490
earth-style so they could just apply it

00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,590
the specificities of the the Debian

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,620
policy work is that it's also quite

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,740
English bound and it needs competences

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,229
to be able to write reasonable technical

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,090
English and from what I remember it from

00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,910
past discussions there is also quite a

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,039
lot of discussions about how exactly the

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,960
thing appears in policy which means that

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,789
it's not just about having a good idea

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,830
of how the technical policy should look

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,470
like in terms of technical terms it's

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,389
it's also how it should be written in

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,770
proper English and that means that the

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,870
competence is to do that are not

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,699
necessarily the same I need to even

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,800
basically a bit about the proper English

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,630
part because I have actually some

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,690
feedback I gotten you can all hear not a

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:23,340
native English speaker from which

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,919
because I got it sometimes that if

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,500
English is something written by me or I

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,940
had a lot of fight with Steve about

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,740
proper English for our release announced

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,479
in males and some of the feedback was

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,940
that my English was better understanding

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,289
for non-native speakers it sinks of most

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,000
important thing in policy is to be able

00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:42,419
to understand it so if I would choose

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,789
four and let's say sufficient English

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,930
interpretation of someone everyone can

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:47,940
understand something we just totally

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,650
perfect English but unfortunately even

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,360
shamans can't understand it ice know

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,800
what I'm choosing for you're not a

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,820
lobbying now for a survey of English

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,440
with everybody on the planet can

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,180
understand because it would not be

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,400
helpful either but something in between

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,550
so probably you need a mix of people

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,470
with good good English language skills

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,860
go technical skills and who can work up

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,060
together to find a populate mixture of

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,250
having good English good hanging

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,470
understanding and at least understanding

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,529
for most parts of the projects because

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,120
that extra I think what we aim for I can

00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,680
see the Peter is perhaps not happy with

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,500
what was said

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,720
it's just over interpretating your face

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,000
well so I think I think it's quite

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,949
possible to overstate the requirement of

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,240
needing knowledge across the project

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,930
that was the part I was reacting to

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,300
because in fact I think there's a big

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,450
difference between writing policy and

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:43,320
editing policy or managing the process

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:45,510
of merging bits of policy into our

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,370
policy document set and I've always

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,990
thought there is great value in both

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,880
tech committee work and in policy work

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,550
or making sure the people who best

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,260
understood that area of Technology

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,080
within the project were the ones who

00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,760
were sort of helping to articulate you

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,620
know what our policies around that ought

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,400
to be so I wouldn't get too hung up

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,170
about about sort of broad domain

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,570
knowledge as a requirement for being

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,250
very helpful in the policy process but

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,160
somebody somewhere does have to

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,630
understand the technology you don't get

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,140
the right idea is to capture to begin

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:22,440
with I don't think you have a

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:26,510
disagreement about that so any more

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:30,029
remarks questions proposes

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:43,410
it's a buff not a talk so you should

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:45,810
speak good I start from because it yeah

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,440
the current pile of things looks kind of

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,779
scary and it's not super interesting

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,630
work to dive into very old things and

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:57,240
get people back into discussing specific

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,890
patches and things but the problem of a

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,130
sprint is that you exclude the others

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,589
that are not there but yeah I don't know

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,750
what you could of course all the do is

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:08,370
just Megan it's a virtual spoon saying

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,709
we take from this was that time and have

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,880
an IRC channel dedicated to it so it

00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:15,930
doesn't need to be a physical splint I

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,770
mean a physical husband might be better

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:21,600
but even a non-physical spoon

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,700
yeah it's really all about what it takes

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,920
to motivate people to work on things and

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,390
if the opportunity is some direct social

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,480
interaction with others who are also

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,990
interested in it would help it certainly

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,700
seems like

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,560
working the policy backlog and getting

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,180
things to a more current state is the

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,640
sort of thing our DPL would probably be

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,860
happy to allocate some funds for so yeah

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,410
I'm votin thinking about the money angel

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,089
of it yeah yeah no III don't mean to

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,570
harp on that either I'm just saying that

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:52,089
this that that when we start thinking

00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:54,760
about work or in and around the project

00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:56,800
and certainly the backlog of issues in

00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,020
the policy queue is one example of work

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,330
that's not being adequately attended to

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,209
and we just heard maybe talk about the

00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,800
the notion of trying to find ways to

00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:07,270
incent things around the project that

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,940
need attention that don't have them to

00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,709
happen and if the idea that you know

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,230
having a sprint or something that gets

00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:16,149
people more directly socially engaged

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,589
with each other to tackle a problem like

00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,440
this if it seems like that would be

00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,880
helpful then I wouldn't be too quick to

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,430
to back away from I don't worry too much

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,020
honestly I mean if people feel like

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,640
they're gonna be disenfranchised by not

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,770
being at a sprint there have after all

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,360
been lots of time that's already passed

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,250
where they could have been commenting on

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,100
those elements a policy or participating

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,529
in the discussion so and I think if we

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,720
do a splint should at least do it not

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:42,520
only not only in places but also allow

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,500
people to throw into the splint by IRC

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,220
so I mean that's not an additional

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,140
effort and it really helps so plus one

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,089
thing didn't we might be thinking is

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,070
also reducing the barrier of entry for

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:57,100
new things in policy because we can also

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,320
always undo and if we really is a policy

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,089
that for was something that didn't have

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,560
enough seconds or I don't know something

00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:04,300
we had discussed in the sprint and it

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,890
happens to not be the right thing to do

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,680
then we have another discussion and we

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,910
upload a new version of the policy as

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,610
long as we're not too close to the

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:17,279
freeze so the next ones are Simmons and

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:23,140
is and I because b2 is a queue now so I

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:24,550
guess from I'd like to ask I think an

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,149
interesting question to ask the room

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:30,190
would be are there people you you know

00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:35,610
conceptually might be the kind of people

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:38,500
who would work on policy who aren't and

00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,300
are there things that disincentive that

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,040
that basically when you think about

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,870
working on policy are the things that

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,820
you look at and you go yeah I don't want

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,610
to work on policy because at

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,880
so can we ask people you know other

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,650
reasons you're not working on policy

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,510
okay yes that's a good question first I

00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,570
would like still to answer bit to what

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,430
what you just said

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:02,740
actually I think we should only put in

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:06,160
policy when when we are sufficiently

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,900
convinced that was good for Debian what

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,510
we had been doing in the past was

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,160
basically two takes say other things

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,650
like the developers reference we could

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,480
say yes sir current ideas of cornices in

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,670
that direction but it was not nothing

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,470
formal so if you fail to do that yeah

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,270
you've just fail to do it but I think

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,100
really for policy we should rather say

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,450
this is not what we really expect

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,870
everyone if you're not doing it your

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,520
parents definitely Bucky so what we have

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,380
had in the past is that people said oh

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,420
yes it would be quite nice if we could

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,160
make this move and put it in policy but

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,590
we're not doing it I think that is not

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,570
not something hateful so we should only

00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:44,710
move in policy when it's already so yeah

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,720
and then of another thing I would like

00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,900
to add passing Fisher Trust get an

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,060
answer to Sam's question so are there

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,070
any things they could make it easier for

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,930
people here in this room or people you

00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:07,600
might think might be interested to work

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:09,520
on policy Loomis largest and ask for if

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,830
actually it's somewhat of a virtual IRC

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:18,280
here I'm not doing it well I can answer

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:20,020
for myself is I'm not doing policy

00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,540
because I mean in the T C and then I

00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,490
kind of tend to think it kind of

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,710
conflicts because we are the appeal

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,110
court for whatever policy work could

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:32,950
could create as conflict so it doesn't

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,770
feel perfectly right to do both but yeah

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,060
plus it's not super interesting I mean

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,270
it's not technical work and it's not

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,850
necessarily the thing I enjoy doing so

00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,020
yeah I don't feel very motivated to go

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,650
into doing policy work

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:50,440
on the other hand setting technical

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:53,070
policy is the t-shi work so it's kind of

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,070
the same thing anyway

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:06,810
one of them that's one of you want to

00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:08,610
answer oh just okay then my other

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,160
question is I vote I said before -

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,800
recently appear too harsh to say we

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,560
won't ever basically before we accept in

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,180
seconds on a policy proposal you would

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,780
like to see the difference they get from

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:27,180
our patch play or voter sings our

00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:28,830
beliefs never seem to do then I don't

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,150
have an objection to that I will note

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,530
that there are a lot of patches that

00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,470
even if they're not necessary and get

00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,060
format patched there in patches that I

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,040
mean the difference we didn't get am and

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,330
get apply isn't really I mean yeah

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,970
you've got to go come up with a commit

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:45,780
comment but it's not really that hard to

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,900
do that and those still aren't getting

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,040
applied I don't think I wouldn't say all

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,100
of that was solve everything

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,350
automatically just - let's put it this

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,720
way it could be part of a solution but

00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,400
is not the solution and of course

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,500
anything which now has this little patch

00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,540
I wouldn't say we're just refusing it

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,970
for the fact that it's not it's not a

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,950
gift from our tech so setup is silly and

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,850
we're not doing that I would say and for

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,700
me that's more of an administrative

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,790
question of the actual they've been

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,620
policy maintainer x' that could

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,390
handholds people in the process saying

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,120
oh you have this proposal look I've just

00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:24,330
made it a git version of it so that we

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,130
can all review it in a better way and by

00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,600
that I'm not expressing any agreement or

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:30,120
disagreement on that I'm just making a

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,280
technical change so that we know exactly

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,800
what we're talking about and then you

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,290
push it back to the to the proposer and

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,390
say is that what you mean and that's

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:42,630
more of an administrative thing and if

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,280
that's that's helpful for the process so

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,180
we should certainly be doing it but it

00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,410
doesn't need to be a condition for

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,840
starting a discussion for something new

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,660
to be integrated in policy discussion

00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,220
but for the seconds perhaps but yeah

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,960
yeah but but that also means that the

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,270
maintainer x' could do this

00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,280
administrative work to transform the

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:06,510
whatever the discussion I put in to get

00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:08,339
I think his point is that the maintainer

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,020
czar overloaded the the fun of all

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,530
problem here is the maintainer are not

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:16,290
doing or not that there is more

00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:18,900
maintainer work needed than is getting

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,490
done so pushing more work onto the

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,040
maintainer x' isn't going to make things

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,230
move faster the claim and I think it's

00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,240
true is that we have a large number of

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,580
things that are adequately seconded that

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,130
are not moving forward and that's the

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,600
problem we're trying to fix so adding

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,530
more tasks to the people who could move

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:42,180
things forward I don't think it's going

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:44,130
to help I guess my question is is the

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:47,310
the obvious solution to this is more

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:51,300
maintainer x' of course are are there

00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:52,980
any other solutions um that we're

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,890
considering are we basically sitting

00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,840
here looking at what do we do to get

00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,700
more policy maintainer is that really

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,550
the question of this Boff is how do we

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,590
get more pies no the question is basic

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,600
question for me is lasa

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:10,550
it's the only way we could do other ways

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:15,180
so basically I mean I plan to call this

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:16,770
off later on going other things for us

00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,780
to be done in Debian and I think yes I

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:21,090
have some of them so I'd like to find

00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:25,380
people there but the question is is it

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:27,750
only things that we reasonably need are

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,450
more maintenance or as a service or do

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,950
we say well but we poles it also slowly

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,830
the questioners are moving the right

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:37,260
direction and so that'sthat's basically

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,940
the question for me and not because I

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,590
would like to avoid to say yes I have

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,630
sees ideas so I'm just doing it and

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,520
pushing it and giving robots a chance to

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,710
review what on what I'm planning but of

00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,710
course if nobody else has ideas I'm just

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:52,680
looking for more but whatever maintain

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,780
us people helping to maintain us you

00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,640
don't need to be a whatever long years

00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,980
have been developer to be able to do a

00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,910
lot of useful work on the policy

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,870
especially on cleaning up the patches

00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,280
already exist today yeah I actually have

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,660
a slightly different sense of what I

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,160
think the problem is um

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,050
at various times in the past we've had

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,300
sort of enough warm bodies looking at

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,760
the proposed bits of policy but there's

00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,740
almost a different skill set or a

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,390
different personality matrix or

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,890
something required to be the person who

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,080
actually commits a bunch of those

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,940
changes and it almost feels to me like

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,740
the thing we're missing is someone who's

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,260
sort of willing to be a strong policy

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,330
editor right now yeah it's that it's

00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,580
that sort of last yes okay we've passed

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,370
all the gates now you know let's

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,900
actually put this into policy and the

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,160
problem is you don't want that to happen

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,890
totally willy-nilly

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,110
because even if there's been good

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,170
discussion around elements of policy

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,150
they're still sort of how to put this

00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,160
exactly there's still sort of an element

00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,470
of style or something associated with

00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,600
sort of that final gating of what

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,090
actually gets merged into a policy

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,320
document and well did he I understand

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,750
your point about you know we shouldn't

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,340
be afraid to let things into policy that

00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,050
turn out to be mistakes that we end up

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,420
having to take back out on the flip side

00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:09,960
I've always liked the fact that our

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:13,210
policy sort of trailed best practice and

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,860
that your policy in some sense was the

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,870
codification of sort of everything we

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,970
had learned that was actually good about

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,350
the packaging process and about making a

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,390
system that really works well and

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,390
integrates together and we don't let

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,980
policy sort of lead implementation so

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,750
there's a there's a bunch of sort of

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,030
balancing bits in here and it has not

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,470
been surprising to me at times when we

00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,400
were in a situation where it seemed like

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,200
there were people who were paying

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,120
attention and commenting on proposed

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,300
policy elements but that some of them

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,520
just didn't actually get there there are

00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,260
some people in this world and we we

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,150
certainly had the pleasure of having

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,370
some of them involved in our recent past

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,770
who are really really good at sort of

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:54,700
bringing things like this to closure and

00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:57,990
it's not a skill set everybody has fully

00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,160
Aikido set so yes

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,440
partners and others I'd say are a few

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,720
patches which are not so hot

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,460
Essam this really very important to make

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,350
sure the wording is okay so some

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,210
petrified range a serie when it looks

00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,250
most UK and if somewhere it's not

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,440
perfect we can trust worship an

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,480
enhancement later on so I think you need

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,830
to find the balance but it's not a

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,530
surprise that the people who actually

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,750
policy uploaded I mean we're at

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,760
sometimes worse loss and miss were 2 TC

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,950
members on the four members list of

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,760
maintain us it's not necessarily a

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:33,640
surprise for it so yeah part on the

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,200
other hand is finding someone who is not

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,650
as deep in the project might be quite

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,840
helpful as well I think what at least I

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,270
think we need to slide our because we

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,780
don't have a chance otherwise so get on

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:49,930
it so Morgan yeah

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:54,670
don't have a second microphones on well

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:57,100
so I was a t-t-tech carry buff yesterday

00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,930
or the other day and I remember them

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,260
saying we don't have a lot to do other

00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:08,380
than finding new members would this be a

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:10,420
possible area work where we could debate

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,680
because I'm from others to answer

00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:16,570
because I won't be the course along

00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:20,230
anymore well the Constitution says we

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:22,840
can six one one the question is whether

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:25,540
it makes sense if you take a look at the

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,870
project as a general thing for us to do

00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,960
it

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,820
I kind of see that as last resort like

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,100
if the Debian policy process is so

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,130
broken that the only recourse recourse

00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:39,040
we have is get the TC do that

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:41,260
administrative work and not to dismiss

00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,020
any of that work but that demonstrative

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,970
work nevertheless then we might get

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:52,060
involved but I really see that as last

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:56,230
record and it shouldn't be that way i I

00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:58,720
think I would be hesitant politically to

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:03,070
do that that said I agree with Dalia

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,040
that that if that needs doing um you

00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,270
know if all if all else fails I

00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,640
absolutely agree that it's worth doing

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:13,360
and I should go and you know twist my

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:17,500
arm the reason I mean politically

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,360
hesitant is we had some people who are

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,850
fairly heavily involved in the policy

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:27,580
process recently fairly upset about a TC

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:30,670
decision and I think it's nice to be

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,890
sensitive to that I think it's also nice

00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:35,890
that if we are gonna do a bunch of

00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,540
policy work there's a chance that there

00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,260
will be disagreement about something

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,320
that

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,690
happens and it's nice to have the TC one

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:48,760
level removed to better handle that

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:52,930
disagreement and so yes I absolutely

00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,730
agree that how the TC do it is a fine is

00:23:52,930 --> 00:24:00,100
something that is better than not having

00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:02,860
it done but I think you you know it

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,290
would not be my first choice so now with

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,600
bhisma maintain policy maintain a head

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:10,360
on i would taste of course everyone who

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,730
isn't TC right now is somebody who i

00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,800
would be loved to be a pokémon's a

00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,890
policy because i I know they quoted

00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,750
however I can understand the reasons

00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,990
we're not doing so much sir I also have

00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,390
been used to be not being a keeping a

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:28,600
bit of distance from policy with my TC

00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,300
head on things will now change but yeah

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:41,530
so I can fully understand you that I

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:44,680
think Martina was a microphone okay so I

00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:46,630
think other things otherwise I think we

00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,520
seem to pull it out really - we need to

00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,960
find people who are simplifying people

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,020
and thinking about a splint or whatever

00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,000
else is helping us well maybe one last

00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,280
word about the the teach involvement I

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,710
think what we've basically said is that

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:03,520
the TC as a body involvement doesn't

00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:05,950
make sense unless dot dot but involving

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,870
the TC members in discussing that the

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,730
the virus patches and and and all of

00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:12,430
that totally makes sense and we should

00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:16,450
probably as individuals get involved but

00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:19,540
not in front line I think getting input

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:21,550
from from appropriate people and I think

00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,260
lots of the team members are appropriate

00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:26,140
people for different parts of the policy

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:28,390
is a very good signature to but

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:31,750
something else I suppose is what life in

00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:34,450
the process so I I appear but only do

00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,760
not be good if the TC members or the T

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,770
as a body puts lives applauses however

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,820
it probably lots of cases where the

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:46,080
input would be quite valuable so just

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,940
ask this because it's something where

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,710
I'm surprised it didn't come up and and

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,830
I'm pretty good at kicking at elephants

00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:56,890
in the room

00:25:52,830 --> 00:26:03,010
so I will note that in the last year and

00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:04,300
a half we've kind of found a couple of

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:09,880
people who've walked away from the

00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:14,080
policy process frustrated and upset is

00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:17,430
that actually so I guess I'm surprised I

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,510
think we should ask ourselves whether

00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:21,670
like talk to people who might be

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,960
potential new contributors and ask is

00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,760
that an environment you'd feel

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,400
comfortable working in or just does the

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,810
you know level of hostility and some of

00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,700
the discussions make it harder for you

00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,700
to contribute there I don't I don't know

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:37,300
what the answer is I know for myself it

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,950
would that that is not a part of the

00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:43,720
project I would really enjoy jumping

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:44,860
into um but maybe it isn't maybe for the

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,350
people who'd be willing to do the work

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:52,330
it isn't an issue um if it is an issue I

00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:55,120
think we should work on fixing it yes

00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:58,210
it's up in my mind for the moment but

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,490
that might be very long so it's really I

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,620
mean see are things which are again non

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,470
hostile environment like this is a Pecha

00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,670
which was just second and nobody

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,590
disagreed and so also we can just apply

00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,720
it I think that's a non hostile

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:13,150
environment and say I'm more it's a

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,250
difficult discussions and if somebody is

00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,630
going to say I'm going to work on policy

00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,030
but I'm keeping out of all those

00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,980
difficult discussions a puppy still well

00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,720
it'd be very great so I think what we

00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,030
should do is speaking up for most people

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,530
and saying you should choose which part

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:31,450
of policy bosses you want to take it

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:33,340
trust this or this VC is a non-hostile

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,400
part or are you willing to take as a

00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,630
hostile power so yes sir why do you

00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,650
think you're going to be able to tell

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:43,000
which ones are hostile I mean like you

00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,500
will notice that some more investigate

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,530
hospital you could say okay I'm topping

00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,870
is this one okay which might be okay if

00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,250
we basically if you have the set of mind

00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,240
to say it's okay to just stop working

00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,710
with buck

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,480
because it's getting hostile now in some

00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,460
other age might take over or not that's

00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,290
something else and if there's a feel oh

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,120
I started with service taking care of

00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,620
that were now ready to finish it I think

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,760
it's okay to say this is getting too

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,490
hostile I'm not taking care of it

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,940
anymore

00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:12,090
so and then yeah perhaps it might be

00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,530
better to trust share our sources people

00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,030
who don't mind about being hostile

00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,670
comments or all that had happened not

00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,680
have said have had session debian so

00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,210
that say experiences that takes a

00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,190
hostile ones and the other ones takes a

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:27,990
not so hostile ones or at least under

00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:29,340
CEQA I get hostile trust an idea that

00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,710
layer depends for me all the people who

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,060
actually doing the work I prefer so I'm

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,810
not saying you need to do a system that

00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:39,180
way about whoever feels comfortable with

00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:42,620
or what we should do whatever is

00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,620
comfortable the people doing the work

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,070
okay

00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,440
one silly at the idea about recruiting

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:54,270
would be to user abuse of the fact that

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,250
the TC the TC terms expire and we have

00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,350
multiple people in that room that have

00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,940
seen or will see their

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:02,910
TC term expire and we should probably

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,480
talk to them about being becoming policy

00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,660
maintainers

00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:10,650
so you want to source the policy

00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:16,740
maintainer from the TC team its to new

00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:23,130
people per year there's one right behind

00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:24,900
you you could start with I think we

00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:30,780
could play to an odd amount of mao-a

00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:37,950
policy you're absolutely determined to

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:40,670
have me not involved in I said oh we can

00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,670
find out later on

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,040
[Laughter]

00:29:51,550 --> 00:30:06,080
you can choose whatever you would like

00:29:53,810 --> 00:30:08,050
to play so you reverse engineer the

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:15,050
rules

00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:16,880
that's what Linton is about anyway I

00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,430
think I should start to get more funny

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:24,320
but I don't think we get it further

00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:26,270
points so so yes so I would propose to

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,190
just close the session here

00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:31,250

00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,900
youth who was not saying so much also of

00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,460
the ones who were saying much would like

00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,620
