	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,150
so what we want to do here is to make a

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:11,309
quick tour tour explanation of what key

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,880
signing is I know many of you know it

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:22,170
very well

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:23,850
I see this a who is here for the first

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:32,340
time taking part of her key signing

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:36,719
party ok several people okay a you you

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:40,070
did send well I know we cannot go case

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,750
by case but we are starting from the

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:46,550
assumption that you got the file from an

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,579
evil the the the file that he put in his

00:00:46,550 --> 00:01:00,379
people that we an orc space and it's

00:00:50,579 --> 00:01:00,379
something yep

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:23,790
yeah it should work now I'm resetting my

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:25,320
outputs once and twice the surrender now

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:32,160
okay let's go with your computer it will

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:34,980
be easier well okay a he has some one of

00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,570
you not downloaded a file from people

00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:42,980
Debian org slash tilde an evil slash

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:47,370
something the /k a speedo dot dot txt

00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:50,910
somebody didn't download it okay people

00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:54,090
that didn't download it really really

00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,940
really really really really should think

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:01,170
over if they are participating in the

00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:05,400
the key signing or they should wait to

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:09,240
to like properly understand and get the

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,030
get the the procedures because this is

00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,890
well something important for each of us

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:19,709
and we need you to already know that the

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,040
file you have is valid what we're going

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:24,540
to do now is to check if each of you got

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,780
exactly the same file

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,920
the thing is we're not just certifying

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,330
each other in person we're not

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,239
exchanging thing fingerprints but we are

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,239
agreeing on a document that already has

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,550
a magic number that magic number is the

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:50,100
result of a cryptographic operation done

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:52,380
over the whole of it right so yeah I

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:58,950
think so yeah I think that will be the

00:02:52,380 --> 00:03:03,000
the best idea a so people that that have

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:07,170
a their key signing party

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,620
sheets printed a please start from that

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,530
side on what each one of you reading one

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,300
digit of the shark preferably not will

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,590
print out perfectly from the show that

00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,250
you're calculating on your computers

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,250
that you calculated yep so

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:32,450
so it pointed someone against our yeah

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:36,980
top left Jeremy okay going this way who

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:39,020
is the first one to have I know but but

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:43,210
but we can only check those people that

00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,210
do have it then

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:29,530
okay next okay

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,200
keep it coming keep it coming

00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,640
a/c

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:17,960
7:3 bd1 hey so I will reasonably assured

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,160
that this is the right number I think I

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,890
missed one okay the reason for this and

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,040
the reason to do more II suggested to do

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,320
it in a distributed way is that often if

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,770
we don't have checked this number

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,780
ourselves for example you are not sure

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:39,740
if I did it because I was reading it

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:43,610
from a paper a I I did not check this

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:46,970
myself well the file may I have may be

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,280
different from yours or my signature my

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,730
my fingerprint on that file may be

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:57,470
different from from what you all have so

00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:59,600
once we have agreed on this well you can

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,370
later grab one of these papers please

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,500
remember to put your name on it so you

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,080
remember it's yours and what not and

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,320
this is meant to make it easier so you

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,410
don't have ten pages of the text with

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,530
you just one but this is no replacement

00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:19,180
for the kisses for the text you already

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:24,320
have that where each of the the

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:26,060
fingerprints are now what what are we

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,160
going to do we're not going to have a

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,250
tea signing party in the traditional

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,470
boring long sense we're not going to

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,390
start at you and checking each other's

00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,450
identity each one of us will have

00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:41,930
different criteria on which to sign the

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:44,180
the key of another person and the best

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:48,890
way to do this is not to just start

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:51,320
checking documents but to do so in well

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,330
- Chatta wait to get to know the person

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,660
but because that's the only way the

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,810
identity will really remain like a fixed

00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,730
to our brains

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:05,120
pollito doesn't trust anybody

00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:08,300
I know poor little bird but well we we

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,640
have to bear with him as the reason for

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,250
us to lock him around the world is that

00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:17,200
he's he doesn't trust us they're like

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,200
carriers to buy his own plane tickets

00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,460
well I was in the other session I was

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,460
telling about some ideas have been

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:29,840
playing with and I want you to consider

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:33,740
at least a although I did an interesting

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,760
observation to what I suggested a I

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:41,930
suggest you consider expiring signatures

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,090
say I I know some of you for a very long

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,820
time and I know that I will still

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:50,030
remember you in a long time but people

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:53,360
that we have not known so for so long

00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:56,180
well maybe we should sign for a short

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,490
short amount maybe we should sign create

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,270
signatures for three years that's what I

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:05,990
suggest and renew them later on what she

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:09,020
said is that a gpg doesn't really allow

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,850
for that so we have to really tribal

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:15,050
check that at some point but it does

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:19,870
allow for expiring signatures I think we

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:23,120
should do it and well my computer is not

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:28,810
be there enabled right now but maybe you

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,810
can there's a GPG option

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:51,480
he asks hurts ask expire if you say this

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,360
to GPG it will ask you how long do you

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,880
want that key to be a key signature to

00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:02,670
be valid for I have put this in my both

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:09,210
my GPG that stuff and my past

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:12,540
can you BG home gbgs cough so if you're

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:16,260
using half remember to use classic stuff

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:29,100
you remember to use it to do that as

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:30,870
well yeah yeah well a sorry yeah bill is

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,410
asking what's the point of explaining

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,150
signatures the thing is a I will most

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,800
probably remember your face ten years

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,390
from now even if I don't see you from it

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,330
from out to then but it's not the case

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:45,060
of everybody and as this is the source

00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:49,410
of the only link to the real world

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:53,370
identities we have a if you check in

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,890
your your what you have signed so far

00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,360
you will probably find many people you

00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,840
don't remember who they are

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:10,830
so you're still asserting their identity

00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:12,510
today a the problem with your assertion

00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,400
is just because I don't remember their

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,950
face in ten years it doesn't invalidate

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,470
the fact that I went to some effort to

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,080
validate the relationship between their

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,930
key material and their real-world

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,120
identity at the time we seen it so well

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,640
I understand your point about we don't

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,340
always remember people forever to me

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:35,460
once I've engaged in sort of the

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,560
protocol that I require for giving

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,370
someone a signature on their key I don't

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,590
see how time

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:47,950
it's that right I mean it's a personal

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:50,980
personal policy well what I showed in my

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,650
previous talk goes about how I think

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,050
these maps with a reality with with what

00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:59,020
we have seen in the evolution of our key

00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,210
ring but again this is not something we

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:05,110
will ever require this this is something

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,520
I suggest yeah my point was overlap with

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,810
what Peter just said but it also

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,220
includes a suggestion

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,440
so yeah first of all in the other

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,940
session you did say that your

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,280
interpretation of what a signature means

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,900
is at this point in time that person

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:21,820
controls the key even if I remember you

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:26,350
in several years which again I think is

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:28,570
likely it does not mean that I have any

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,780
evidence that in several years time you

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:34,450
control the writing key but in several

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,190
years time it has nothing to did control

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,970
of several years prior so instead of

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,800
having a time-limited signature or or

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,430
revoking those signatures I think it

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,740
makes sense

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:48,280
between now and three years from now to

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,260
teach GPG how at the users discretion

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,950
whether it had been adopted as a policy

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,870
or not to ignore all signatures and then

00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,490
we would still not necessarily have to

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,030
see each other but I would have to have

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,860
some way of knowing that in 2019 you

00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,440
control the key at that point but I

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,690
would not be your ID yeah I mean this is

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,150
yeah you're completely right and that's

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,700
part of what I was talking with sheesh

00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:16,360
right now I think Jonathan was say

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:19,000
wanting to ask so so yeah there's say

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,730
there's just the first time I'm like

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
widely floating this idea and I do

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:30,520
expect well several frictions to appear

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,520
with it but I think there's it's worth

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:36,490
exploring since there is some

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,260
disagreement about the validity not a

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:42,670
little either the usefulness of this

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,379
even with any key remains tkg's position

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,869
is

00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:49,889
a signature is an assertion that at a

00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:51,660
point in time all of his procedures were

00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:55,499
complied with in a way that he was happy

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:58,499
to sign the key but dkg from 2011 is

00:13:55,499 --> 00:14:01,019
different to dkg from 2016 and his

00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:03,179
policies may have changed and an expiry

00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,789
offers him the opportunity to to

00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,289
reassert that his procedures have still

00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:10,799
been met and he is still happy with the

00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:13,919
signature on that key which is a valid

00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,059
viewpoint I think the thing is that

00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,159
anyone who's looking at doing

00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:20,789
certificate expiry and I want to do the

00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:23,519
same to expiry the tools are terrible

00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:24,869
so the risk from my point of view is

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,899
that people start doing this without

00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:30,059
committing to being updating their

00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,589
signatures and reciting keys we will

00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,079
have a web that falls apart because we

00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:35,909
have all expired signatures so I

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:39,499
personally am not engaging in this a

00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:42,359
presence I can see some benefit to it if

00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:44,039
people want to play with it be aware

00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:45,720
that unless you make a concerted effort

00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,850
say you choose a three year expiry in

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,949
three years time you need to go back and

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,779
look at your signatures again or things

00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:54,119
start to fall apart even and unuseful

00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,889
ways so there is a commitment a

00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:58,049
long-term commitment if you want to

00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:59,279
engage in this there is some benefit if

00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:03,989
you want to be able to say update your

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,269
key signing policies in the future but

00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:07,979
time will tell and I certainly think

00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:10,139
that I'd be at ten years ago we're still

00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:11,609
cryptographically strong and therefore

00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:14,609
still valid as I had to fight these

00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:17,639
people and on whatever so it's a choice

00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:20,389
thing and that's an awareness or there

00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,350
are some potential benefits I suppose

00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:25,529
should you repeat the protocol of the

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,929
key signing process yeah a well as you

00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:31,199
suggested earlier maybe we can we can

00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:33,329
exchange the signature here for for all

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,009
to see for for the people who have not

00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:37,819
kind of complicated for me to sign

00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:37,819
people's keys them

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:49,470
the basics of the protocol are we all

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,690
agreed on this hash we all downloaded

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:56,760
this text file and calculated the hash

00:15:51,690 --> 00:16:00,170
in that can you well yes as I was going

00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,790
to say that's what I'm busy explaining

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,170
when you've downloaded that file you

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,970
check that your key appeared in it

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,370
correctly that the fingerprint of your

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:11,910
key was the fingerprint of the key you

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:15,240
control when you want to sign someone's

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,280
key you verify that their name matches

00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,960
the person you're talking to

00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,400
however you choose to do that and yeah

00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,500
people have different protocols under

00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,010
some people codes and documents um yeah

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,690
each person will have different trust

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,380
levels for example I was about to tell

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:36,660
you well a if we haven't crossed sign

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,310
yet you you're free to tell me well I'm

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,380
not saying signing based on this because

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,350
I don't have my passport on me most

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,290
people trust on their path on the other

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:49,140
person's Passport as I mean that that's

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:51,900
my only valid ID here in South Africa as

00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:56,010
a Mexican so I can just produce these

00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:58,080
two documents which may be sufficient

00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,620
for somebody and not for somebody else

00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,570
so it tells me are you okay by saying my

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,620
key based on this I'm happy to sign your

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,210
key without seeing those because I've

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,880
known you Grateful Dead concerts yeah I

00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:11,940
I often don't check the identity of

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,970
people I can already recognize but well

00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:19,250
it's a it's not a bad tool for for each

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:22,910
of you to set their own levels of trust

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,990
so you verify the person's identity and

00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,750
either using one of these cheat sheets

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,950
you note that they say they've checked

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,570
the fingerprints and they've checked

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,770
their keys fingerprints

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,540
I mean they've checked the signature of

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,190
the file the hash of the file now check

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,650
their key keys fingerprint of the file

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,160
and you put another checkbox in the bit

00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:46,170
that you happy with their identity so I

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:50,550
check that's a job I could try and use

00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:53,930
this document camera oh you seen these

00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,930
things they're very fancy Wow

00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:20,970
whoo okay Wow so this cop he belongs to

00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:25,650
stefano Rivera I have verified that that

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:27,900
hash is the correct hash I have verified

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,760
that my key is correctly in there and

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,950
have you verified that you I verified my

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,840
keys correct okay and you verify the

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,970
hash in this presentation of course I

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,040
ever tried the hash just some minutes

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:42,600
ago okay I know I didn't check it at

00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,520
this presentation I checked it before

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,470
but I I did check it

00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,530
goodness verify the fingerprint is

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,690
verified his ID at that point I am happy

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,510
to go open sign his key later which I

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,970
have to do offline unfortunately okay so

00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:00,570
I will try to get my computer to output

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:05,360
video by this thing because I can sign

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,360
your key from my home machine but

00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:17,010
shall we put that down

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:19,710
oh do you want that yeah yes I cannot be

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:24,510
there but well I think we're actually

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:27,900
five minutes overtime now no there's a

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:30,180
nice Bowl so if anyone wants to watch

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,610
gonna sign a key it's very exciting

00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:39,120
I really really this is like one of the

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:40,740
best bits of Debian but oh okay can I

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,670
make your suggestion that I thought of

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,750
as tweaked the long line key signings

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,690
but we could probably apply it here

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,670
somehow which in the past that struck me

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:54,060
that the problem with the long line key

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,710
signings is that the you forget the

00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,930
signatures from the weakest link in the

00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,220
key signing so someone that's a complete

00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,560
idiot and doesn't check anything will

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,990
sign everybody's key and it would be

00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,760
nice if the we raised the bar a bit and

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,460
made it so there is something closer to

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,290
the the most paranoid person standards

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,390
that are applied so if you have a long

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:15,270
line and when you saw someone's Aidid

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,190
was total nonsense you shouted out the

00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:20,490
number of the person that you weren't

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:22,950
going to sign then the next people would

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,980
be much more suspicious much more

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,990
suspicious of that ID so if you see ID

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,460
and you have a good reason to be

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,410
suspicious of it I think we should

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,940
collect that information because if

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,170
someone presents me with a dodgy looking

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:40,020
UK passport I will probably spot it but

00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,760
I won't spot the problem with I don't

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,620
know an Argentinean passport and vice

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,410
versa so we have some people that are

00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,870
quite expert at assessing this stuff if

00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,360
we collected whenever anybody actually

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,370
had good reason to be suspicious then

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,140
that might attempt to people not to

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,310
trust that ID after all even though they

00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,310
looked okay to them over time

00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:09,919
are you gonna hit enter

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,919
