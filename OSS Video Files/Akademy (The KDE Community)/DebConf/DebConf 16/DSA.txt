okay and this will now be the DSA buff

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,849
that was going to happen it means he's

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,849
nine sorry

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:23,400
welcome to the Boff this is intended to

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,350
be a Boff so we'll do a short

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,119
presentation at the beginning to talk

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,410
about the team and the changes in the

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,029
team membership and what we've done over

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,610
the last year and what we're doing in

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,680
the coming year and then we'll turn it

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,270
over to the Boff and we can answer your

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,579
questions and receive your comments and

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,230
suggestions and I'll introduce my

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,620
co-panelists in a moment when I go

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,620
through the team composition so I just

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,510
briefly went through the agenda if you

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,120
don't know who we are and what we do we

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,879
have a delegation from the DPL to do

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,680
these five things paraphrase from the

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,510
actual delegation text we maintain the

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,489
user database we maintain the Debian

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,649
infrastructure we run a bunch of the

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,449
core Debian services around

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,700
authentication authorization email and

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,310
some other things we coordinate with our

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,560
hosting partners and our service

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,020
partners so an example is UBC where I

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,409
work or fastly we're tall F works used

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,600
to work and of course we work with you

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,560
to deliver the services that you want to

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,820
have on Debian org infrastructure so

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,780
this is who we were and I don't know if

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,420
he's in the room

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,680
Faden stepped down recently so I'd like

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,680
to thank him for a service

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,010
and aurelion joined us so we suckered

00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,970
another guy in and he's been working

00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:50,130
hard on our stuff so with me up here our

00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:56,050
toll-f Martin Hector

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:57,550
Julian and Paul's hiding Peter can't be

00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,670
here because he's defending his thesis

00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,670
this week so soon he'll be dr. Peter

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,320
puffer

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,400
so looking back the things that we've

00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,700
been up to

00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,250
we've been on a bit of an MMA kick so

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,720
Bedell would like that I think we've

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,220
been trying to merge the Deb conference

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,860
for structure in its bit it's slow-going

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,960
so we'd like to ramp that up a bit

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,050
but some of that has already occurred

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,970
and we have merged that have been ports

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,400
infrastructure in so we've let go of

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:30,670
some legacy things like leaded lead a

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,620
Debian net and of course we have our

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,310
ongoing every year we refresh our

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:40,090
five-year plan and we're in year one of

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,650
our latest five-year plan so over the

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,890
last year we refreshed the security

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,110
mirrors and hardware's been received to

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,030
refresh the ftp master although the

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,550
function hasn't been moved from the old

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,400
machine to the new machine yet so would

00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:57,640
really like to thank HPE for that

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,290
generous donation in the last year build

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,050
the porter boxin we received more

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,610
machines for PowerPC arm and four MIPS a

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,769
bunch of that has been deployed at some

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,190
of the critical infrastructure necessary

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:12,160
for those ports to be available or

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,780
releasable and from the service

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,489
management perspective really there's

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,680
only two major ones that we want to call

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,720
out in our slide deck and that's the

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,480
transition of the majority of our

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,420
certificates from Gandhi to let's

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,850
encrypt Gandhi has been a great partner

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,810
to us and to open-source projects in

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:33,070
general so we should thank them for that

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,560
but of course we're big supporters of

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,989
let's encrypt and so we've moved all of

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,280
our expiring certificates over to let's

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:43,389
encrypt and we'll finish the rest of

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,670
them off and Paul primarily with Lucas

00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,079
or Lucas with Paul whichever direction

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,829
is more appropriate in terms of the load

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,629
of work

00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,980
worked on the service guidelines that

00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:53,390
are available in the wiki and we'll go

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,650
through a little bit of that here since

00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,079
there seems to be some confusion about

00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:03,349
why things should or should not be on

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:05,840
Debian org so moving forward on the

00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:07,970
mergers and acquisitions piece were

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,540
still interested in completing the dead

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:16,579
can't fork the wiki the mailing lists

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:17,989
etc and it given the various mail

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,729
threads that have occurred it would be

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,610
interesting to work with service

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:25,070
performance on replacements for alia so

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,479
people talk to book gitlab I talked a

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,130
little bit about why are we doing both

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,539
get lab and get not in the sense that

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,220
they're competing services but why are

00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:33,919
we doing multiple things of the same

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,020
flavor it would be interesting to try to

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,090
get a group of people together who are

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,030
interested in continuous integration

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:45,110
source code management etc to have this

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:50,630
as being a new service or replaces only

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:53,900
of infrastructure refresh HP e will be

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:56,210
donating a very large amount of hardware

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,810
that will be hosted at UBC we call it

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,909
the bite-mark equivalent so it'll

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,039
include an enclosure some number of

00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:06,680
blades and a lot of storage the intent

00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:09,740
is so that we can have redundant

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,680
services at either bite mark or at UBC

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,810
and not to be have a single point of

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,110
failure with with either one of the or

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:21,169
hosting organizations or the other our

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,720
next big ticket item for which we do not

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:26,840
yet have sponsorship so we might buy it

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,639
with Debian funds will be CD image it's

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,919
a huge memory machine with large and

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:36,919
fast storage after that we might

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,260
consider doing FTP master and CD image

00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,840
again meaning that both of those

00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,479
machines are enormously expensive and

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,300
large but also single points of failure

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:49,460
so ftp master is more critical of course

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,979
but having a second CD image means that

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,530
we could build a numerous cds in half

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,690
the time and finally we're interested in

00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,390
supporting the build deport or effort of

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,400
course and so

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:04,040
some more arms or more MIPS we could

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,170
talk about why we need even more and

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,230
some of the new stuff for example the

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:12,890
sparc64 potential donation from Oracle

00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:15,610
and from a management perspective we're

00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:19,820
working with the console server supplier

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,500
soon to be announced that will be

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,780
helping us get a consistent set of

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,160
hardware for remote management across

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,870
our various data centers so that we

00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,690
don't have to deal with different

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,980
console servers the next step of this of

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,170
course would be you know consistent

00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,820
power management consistent UPS is if we

00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:38,300
had those it's such a such a but all of

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,250
it is to try to lessen the burden on us

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,690
in terms of all right at that location I

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,460
have to dance on this foot and tap my

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,260
head this way in order to get to be to

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,480
the console

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,460
finally services we continue to work on

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,710
user juror LDAP I haven't done anything

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,240
last year Paul found a couple of people

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:57,920
to help out and in the Deb conte vein we

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,370
continue to do some of the video

00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,810
processing infrastructure and some of it

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,090
is not as ideal as we would have wanted

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,240
it so we're looking at ensuring that

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:12,830
this can be processed quickly and can be

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:16,490
stored quickly okay so that's our last

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:19,340
year and our year going forward this is

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,990
a bulleted list from the long text that

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,500
is in the service requirements for on

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,990
the wiki really the key points here are

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,480
from a DSA perspective the earlier you

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,840
engage us in your proposed service

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,360
design and the more effort you put in to

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,510
having a private and secure service

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,940
offering that is architected well and

00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,230
even if it needs to use new software

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,010
that software you put the energy into

00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,840
making backported packages then the more

00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:51,560
prepared we are to run it on debian org

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,560
infrastructure so we need three three or

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,560
four things really we need a team to be

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,960
in place it can't be a single individual

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,330
it needs to be using back at least state

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,600
and backported if not stable packages

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:10,039
because we want to drink our own

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,889
kool-aid effectively we want the

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,270
architecture to be recognized privacy

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,580
and security so for example we don't

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,319
keep Apache logs or we and Adam

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,509
anonymized Apache logs so we're quite

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,129
interested in making sure that users of

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,169
our services have their privacy

00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,059
protected so if your service isn't

00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,520
architected that way that becomes a

00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:29,629
stumbling block potentially and you need

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,189
to understand what your service

00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:32,539
requirements and articulate them early

00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:34,459
because we don't have an infinite amount

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:37,430
to sitting around we are getting a lot

00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:42,039
of gear from HPE it's true and that will

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:45,350
now make a bunch of hardware available

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,269
but you know it kind of kind of goes

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,500
like this in terms of feast or famine as

00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:52,880
to what's available at any point in time

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,980
so we when I open it for QA we can go

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,069
back to the service requirements port

00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,110
requirements there are some people who

00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:02,360
are a little bit confused about when I

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,699
write an email that says we have some

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,190
concerns as to whether or not that's a

00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:08,660
blocking concern no it's most of the

00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,220
concerns that we've expressed in the

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,040
emails recently are non blocking

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:16,040
concerns but there is you know there is

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,139
a red yellow green set of flags for

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,209
release architectures on purpose so red

00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,010
is certainly a blocking concern we have

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,720
yellow concerns non blocking concerns

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,050
things that should be rectified if we

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,329
want to meet our objectives for building

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,490
hardware so really the amount to

00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:33,440
independence from any particular vendor

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,139
independence from any particular hosting

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,959
provider hardware under our control

00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:41,029
hardware that is available or under hard

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,360
warranty support or post warranty

00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:47,329
support the idea being that we shouldn't

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,970
be dependent on a single provider of

00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:52,279
equipment or a single host er of that

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,750
particular equipment because if they go

00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,680
away if the relationship breaks down

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,089
fire occurs which has happened then we

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,130
don't have a way of supporting that

00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:03,440
architecture so we we apply that

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,699
principle to all the services we run in

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,350
Debian or against the bite-mark

00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:08,810
equivalent and we are attempting to

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:14,360
apply that principle to all the porter

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:16,220
and buildi boxes and so from a port

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,000
status perspective this was gone over a

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,230
little bit and the release discussion

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,890
earlier

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,800
but with a finer DSA perspective we

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:30,380
don't have any issues with AMD or i386

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,850
we have some issues with K FreeBSD in

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,530
terms of how the security archive works

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,380
there and that should either fold into

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:39,260
the regular stuff or move to ports arm

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,630
64 Armel and our mhf we have some

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,000
non-blocking issues and all of them are

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,350
improving fortunately the number of

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,470
machines that still require local

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:51,140
support has reduced significantly we

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,850
have fewer machines that aren't

00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,490
development boards and more on some

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,080
production quality boards we have

00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,610
insufficient hardware and that might be

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,570
a strange statement what I mean by that

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:07,250
is all the hardware is hosted at with

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:08,450
vendors that's the second the next

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,370
moment if it's efficient hosting

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,400
locations most of it is with two vendors

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,020
so if the relationships are those

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,520
vendors then we're still in the same

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,280
bucket it would be nice to have some of

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,470
these boards at other locations that

00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,610
aren't vendor controlled so this isn't

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,350
to imply that we have a poor

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,850
relationship these vendors this is me

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,480
wearing a very I'd like to be

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:32,690
independent of of any particular failure

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,650
point hat and that's why I mean I we

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,260
continue to say that these are

00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,730
non-blocking issues because the vendors

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,680
that are providing us with arm hardware

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:44,630
have been great MIPS MIPS l mips l 64 l

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,310
i gained some non-blocking issues they

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,260
are improving primarily the aging and

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,400
buggy hardware that was at ubc has been

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,500
replaced and is online now and includes

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,620
FP use so their ability to build

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,330
packages is significantly increased

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,280
PowerPC and PPC 6040 else I'm

00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,560
non-blocking again insufficient hardware

00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,780
in hosting locations and s/390 same

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,810
thing completely reliant on sponsored

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,250
hardware now for PowerPC iBM has been

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,540
great as well and we might get some more

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,050
hardware there and find a new home for

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,320
it

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:18,170
s/390 we will never buy an s3 90 so

00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,750
there's no way to onion turn the s3 nine

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:25,100
a yellow flag into a green flag short of

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:27,200
a lot of money so this is how to contact

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,180
us you can send us an email in private

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,770
it just goes to the team members or you

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,210
can send it to us in public at Debian

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,410
admit it's not archived but there are

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,619
other people on

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,089
Debian admin request tracker you can

00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:40,069
submit tickets for service I request

00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:42,259
rocker or you can come and chat with us

00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:44,629
in the Debian admin and IRC dot of T

00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:46,639
seed on that I didn't put Debian org

00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:50,899
there because I think there's an SSL

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,449
cert issue for the sands and finally

00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:56,899
these are some references that you can

00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:58,999
go to to learn more about DSA or the

00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:02,949
service hosting I didn't put up the the

00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:05,239
ports and that's it for our quick

00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:07,039
presentation because it's meant to be a

00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:12,889
buff and I'd like to open up the floor

00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:17,479
to questions answers and comments this

00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:19,279
is gonna be a short Boff okay alright so

00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:24,439
I want to go back to the requirements

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:26,059
for services so you said you want to dog

00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:29,089
food our stuff so you have one stop

00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:30,559
things from stable and back port but

00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:32,689
there's a loophole that because you

00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,489
don't want the service itself coming

00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:37,129
from the archive right because in that

00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:47,389
case I need route the service at me

00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:49,579
needs route to be able to upgrade we

00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:51,589
actually prefer people to at least for

00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:55,189
self though up the services that they

00:13:51,589 --> 00:14:03,079
come out of whatever the service

00:13:55,189 --> 00:14:09,909
provider is using brother didn't use it

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:09,909
okay no no okay no it's not it's my

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,869
should i okay yeah it should be better

00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:19,939
and I know it you're right that for

00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:22,459
anything we write ourselves or you know

00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:26,329
any we as in Debian writes ourselves we

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:28,309
prefer it to come out of whatever get or

00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:32,029
whatever versus a control system they

00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:35,439
use because that iteration cycle for

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:39,109
going through the entire archive is slow

00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:41,419
but any dependencies in you know Python

00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:46,149
modules or whatever we really prefer

00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:46,149
that come out of darker

00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:22,449
hello we're here to be beaten up by you

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:26,980
so that let the beatings begin sure it's

00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:28,089
only opinions at this point so he asked

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:34,300
if I could speak a little bit more about

00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:37,269
good lab yeah I don't have a preference

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,589
of one over the other my my chief

00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,059
concern is that I don't want to get into

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,490
the same position we are today with Ali

00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:45,160
off so we have something that is labeled

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:48,850
Debian org that isn't managed by us and

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,829
effectively has a single service owner

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,259
at this point and if that person were to

00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:54,639
choose to stop doing that service from

00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,860
our perspective it's something that we

00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,249
would want to shut down we really do

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:03,850
need teams to run services so that there

00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:06,370
is some health behind the service

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,379
ownership and it can tolerate people

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:13,300
coming and going as their interests wax

00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:15,550
and wane so any suggestion that we stand

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,050
up a get lab for me seems like a great

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,189
opportunity for people to get together

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:23,679
to talk about how to transition alia out

00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:25,389
that could take years but let's start

00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,490
the conversation about how we get people

00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:29,470
off Ali off and on to get lab if get lab

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,980
is the one that we choose to go forward

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,329
with and I recognize that get lab

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,769
doesn't do all the things that aliens

00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:37,240
does so but that's part of the

00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:39,879
conversation is what are the things that

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,110
Elliott does that can go away and what

00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,939
are the things that can't go away that

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,069
we need some replaced with get lab or

00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:52,329
add-ons to get labs or complements to

00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:54,790
get lab one of the things that a good

00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:58,899
lab doesn't give you is mailing lists do

00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:00,879
you think it's would be possible to use

00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:03,270
the main Debian infrastructure for

00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:07,530
mailing lists instead of

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,900
with the respect to that I'm still

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:15,030
having the list masters head on yes

00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:17,640
file backs against lists Debian Ark the

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:21,630
in the past

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:24,300
Alex Burt who is doing most of list

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:28,860
master nowadays is quite open to and

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:32,940
quite fast on opening lists maybe we

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,070
find a different way though in 2005 or

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,040
2006 I think there was the approach of

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:45,410
having teams Debian net or teams Debian

00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:45,410
Ark which more or less vanished hmm yeah

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:54,360
yes there was a proposal to move that

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,600
and into let's Debian Ark but the

00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,840
software is mostly not used anymore only

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:06,330
by a few very few small teams so maybe

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:08,280
yes we could talk to list master and see

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,560
that we get even more lists massive

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,940
because lists is also currently run only

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:22,020
by effectively one active person and

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:25,680
yeah that's it it would be really nice

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:28,290
to actually have the it be self service

00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,600
rather than having to go and ask what's

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:35,340
effectively a human keyboard to do

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:38,340
something for you so for example I run

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,250
simple at work and simply contained two

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,590
LDAP and the creation of scripts

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,500
straight the scripts to create lists and

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,970
purge lists are easy to make and you

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,610
could hook that into an environment

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,010
where the act of creating a new SCM

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:56,550
repository triggers the creation of a

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,750
couple of project lists so there's lots

00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,280
of ways of accomplishing it but that's

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,100
the conversation that I'd like to see

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,320
happen is is alius does these ten things

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,240
we only really need seven of seven of

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,720
them get lob does for how do we do the

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,720
other three

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,870
um did you ever think about moving to a

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,570
sort of more self-service kind of model

00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,130
for people running services so like you

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,690
have a cloud somebody presents their

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,919
service or coming to you and then you

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,450
decide is okay and gives them like a

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,679
cloud credential so they can run their

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,960
own service or something like that

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,700
because it seems like sort of the DSA is

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,530
more actively involved no I don't run a

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,049
service like I've never never proposed

00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:47,940
and when a service myself but this feels

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:50,970
like an outside team member or now I I

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,370
tried to set that up in the last two to

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:58,409
three years but I was actually lacking

00:19:53,370 --> 00:20:01,980
in time on that and had also security

00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:04,770
problems with some of those services not

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:09,240
properly talking SSL to each other

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:13,620
though in the end I stopped working on

00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:16,559
that maybe if we find time or if we find

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:21,830
a team to help us with that there we

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,830
could try to redo that I'm open to that

00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,860
are you talking about OpenStack there

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,860
okay

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:57,350
with respect to hardware I think we

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:59,450
really really should thank HPE for the

00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:03,020
very huge donation we are currently

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,970
getting from both the server as a

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:09,080
service that were provided last year

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:11,060
which we mainly used for replacing or a

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,200
security debian at our infrastructure

00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:18,380
and on the Houston apt coming donation

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,270
for the blade Center and the storage

00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,790
shelves and the switches and so on

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:25,040
what's coming which will be probably

00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:28,280
shipped the next weeks of the depp conf

00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:32,420
to lucas place and then luca setting

00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:36,620
that up yeah and there'll be there'll be

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:38,570
a public press release for that so we're

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,070
waiting for that second shipment of

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,750
hardware to arrive at ubc before we

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,280
issue that press release and hopefully

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,230
HP will also issue their own press

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,730
release I think it's very good news

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,930
they've supported both this conference

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:52,430
and DSA over the last two years in terms

00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:59,720
of the hardware so it's a great

00:21:52,430 --> 00:22:02,660
relationship because because this this

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,230
donation more or less doubles the CPU

00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:12,010
power be used for services at the moment

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:12,010
so that's a really huge donation

00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:25,550
you guys already mentioned aliasing

00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,700
lists masters are teams that need more

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:30,290
people there other services running on

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:38,780
their network that need more people to

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:41,210
help there are very few teams which

00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:44,180
actually turned down offers of help so

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:47,240
even though the owner at parks might not

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,040
actively be soliciting for help I'm

00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,930
fairly sure that if somebody shows up

00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,420
they would be happy to have more people

00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:55,640
help us and someone running a few

00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,500
servers on Damon hosts like Otto Peters

00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,180
I'm happy for people who like to join

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,620
and I think the same is true for all the

00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,050
teams that runs things on Debian if

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,720
somebody wants the showing control can

00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,340
actually make things better we I think

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,800
most of the core teams are very happy of

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,070
people join because beyond all of them

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,750
what's a lists auto breeders such just

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,690
mostly the same people so if I look now

00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,220
at who's standing there who was in the

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,870
committee who was the released team

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,590
who's on auto builders there might be

00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:27,200
some part of some overlap and it usually

00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:32,030
works the same for all groups if you

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:37,690
send patches often enough even 40 even

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:37,690
for DSA you might get just the correct

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,160
three idea signed and then just work on

00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:47,240
your own that's what we for example did

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,720
was Paul two years ago yet just to reply

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,430
your question they came to mine a couple

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,890
services like pass tracker maybe

00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:59,180
underdog do we have to shut down because

00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:04,160
there was lack of maintainer and HTTP

00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:06,470
revere which is truly useless we we

00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,150
really need someone to if we want to

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,020
keep it live we need someone to maintain

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,020
that service

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,950
not really a question I mean when I said

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,690
that not that I I don't know that

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,090
everyone wants patches it's just that

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,900
maybe we should be more proactive and

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:35,760
let people know explicitly that the

00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,800
teens need people to do specific stuff

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,990
in and publicize that use the

00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,780
communication channels to make people

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:45,180
aware that there's other ways to help

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:50,760
Debian that really need them right now

00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:53,190
besides baggage I've said there's a

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,080
couple of other ad hoc conversations

00:24:53,190 --> 00:25:01,890
around how I don't want to become the

00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:03,090
the DSA process guy but but I am but

00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,980
maybe we need the same kind of thing

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,530
that we do for packages for services you

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,870
know Ric intent to package or intent

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:12,690
intent for service request for help

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,400
orphan so that way it becomes much

00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,750
clearer and transparent to people that

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,400
you know what they want to build why

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,250
they want to build it who's running it

00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,640
we do have some space in the wiki where

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:28,020
people are asked to keep information

00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:30,630
about their service a small description

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,820
but also a way of contacting them should

00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,100
there be in a need arise because even

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,810
that stuff gets get stale so if you

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:43,470
formalize it a little bit more I agree

00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:46,650
with you that that would be helpful I've

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:51,450
been working on lately as we got an

00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:54,090
offer to host servers at the commercial

00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,940
internet exchange which also means that

00:25:54,090 --> 00:26:00,420
we then would probably run our own a s

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,760
and run BGP on our own and working on on

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:07,340
the technical details and that might

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:15,240
help us to get redundancy with one other

00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:17,520
currently also already operating hosting

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,180
locations so we actually have then

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,370
that's more or less the same hardware in

00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,790
in to hosting locations quite close to

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:29,660
each other and then

00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:41,870
getting more even more redundancy with

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:45,080
this hosting location I'm guessing that

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:48,020
the DSA is not maybe not the right team

00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:51,260
to ask but I was wondering about the the

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:54,710
bike shed surface is there anything

00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:57,440
going on on your side or more

00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:01,850
appropriate to ask another team later

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:06,590
this DEP comm how to ask that the P

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:09,230
monster team for that and they yeah it's

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,450
basically being run by them and they'll

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:15,740
obviously have to talk to the the

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:18,530
wannabe old folks and so on but it's so

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:22,550
far at least it hasn't there there's

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:24,980
nothing for us to do on it so that said

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,290
I would absolutely love to have like

00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:34,310
sheds happening you know before I die a

00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:37,190
long age HTTP Vidya what's the current

00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:42,950
state of things regarding newest CD ends

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:45,680
and mesh to be written right now we have

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,420
an experimental service called depth of

00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,500
the underdog which I'm going to speak

00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:54,530
about on Thursday it's out there it's

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:57,680
running we use it for significant parts

00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,890
of the Debian all infrastructure and it

00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:05,870
seems to be working well

00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:07,790
HP HTTP reader as mentioned lacks a

00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,850
service owner it likes somebody to

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:15,710
actually maintain it over time

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:18,050
preferably a team of some size so

00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:21,380
exactly what we're going to do with it

00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:23,900
I don't know but it's it's quite clear

00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,640
we can't have services that run for ages

00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,270
without anybody actually maintaining

00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,310
them at some point they get they don't

00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:33,110
they stop working they get security

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:38,420
problems because what's happening is

00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:39,760
that DSA is getting the requests why am

00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,610
I getting this

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,680
servus arrows on this HTTP read your

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:49,640
service which we actually do not run

00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,890
it's just running under DSA controlled

00:28:49,640 --> 00:29:00,890
on DSA controlled hardware but it's not

00:28:51,890 --> 00:29:06,290
us running that service Debian net uses

00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:09,740
a CDN and you can get source reorg and

00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:13,070
it gets it provides both the Debian

00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:15,560
archive and the security archive and the

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:18,740
debug archive and ports and ports so

00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:22,010
it's actually the most complete mirror

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:24,110
you can have from a redundancy

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,550
perspective we have two CDN providers

00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,680
that we can leverage although we've

00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:30,760
configured this only on one but we'll

00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,760
configure it on the other one as well

00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:48,730
is it going to deprecate HTTP video yeah

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,430
it could record upper carriage to sedan

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,380
we don't need anyone to maintain a nice

00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,000
drop it

00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,950
no but if somebody were to step forward

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,960
and want to continue running HTTP reader

00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,840
that would be good but I think that then

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:10,360
we get back to the alley of versus get

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:15,040
lab conversations are much smaller and

00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:17,680
simpler so it's the the main reason we

00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,870
don't want alias and get lab is that

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,870
they're both pretty big services if

00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,640
somebody wants to run to minor services

00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,350
which compete with each other that's

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,000
fine I don't really consider that a

00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,180
problem I consider it a problem once

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,280
they get to a bed size they want they

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:36,490
start competing for for a namespace such

00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,320
as getting a bit old for instance then

00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:42,910
we need to we need to work at that

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:51,310
somehow and but if you have some minor

00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:53,760
thing then that's why this idiom well I

00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:56,980
think it's a great idea

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,500
doesn't that make us rely too much on a

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:02,890
third party because I guess that a bill

00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:05,100
is like free for us now but I guess if

00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,990
we have to pay for the bandwidth for

00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:13,420
security Debian dot org will be like a

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:17,050
lot of money and it's why we have

00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:20,230
multiple CBN partners and to large

00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:24,010
extent Syrians or or or are becoming a

00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:26,680
commodity so it's as as long as you

00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:29,520
don't integrate too much with the CDE

00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,810
with with the chosen CD on partner then

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:36,490
it's fairly easy to switch to another

00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:38,470
one but yes it's a concern and it's one

00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,010
of the reasons why we still have also

00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,710
have the Mara Network and you know

00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:46,510
having multiple options here is fine

00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,030
that's at our current partner for this

00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:52,540
is heavily invested into supporting open

00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:54,690
source and a host pi PI that you know

00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:57,720
sorry pi PI Python

00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:00,560
and Sipan and various other free

00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,820
software archives as well so you know

00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,340
they're built in free software even

00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:16,230
though the actual platform isn't free

00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:17,940
such as the names of these Citians yeah

00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:20,060
one is fastly and the other one is

00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,280
MaxCDN both of whom were active in

00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:25,440
supporting the open-source community we

00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,450
had a third that we stood up for a tiny

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,200
bit for a test we just didn't continue

00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:33,120
but we could continue with the third so

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,770
we're believers in redundancy not only

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,390
in the hardware and the hosting partners

00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,610
for the hardware that we run the

00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:40,940
services our own services on were

00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:43,470
believers in the redundancy of the

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:47,760
third-party services to be redundant in

00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:50,460
our code so for example CDN or DNS

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:57,900
secondary DNS we have multiple partners

00:32:50,460 --> 00:33:01,050
for both of those services we have we no

00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:05,520
longer run that primary services for DNS

00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:07,590
ourselves we've moved that to to

00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:13,160
commercial a stake which were getting

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:13,160
donated for free it's working quite well

00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:24,710
anything that you as developers expect

00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:24,710
from DSA to to happen in the next year

00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:36,109
so we could just go back to sleep and

00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,789
okay well thank you very much for your

00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:48,760
time

00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:54,700
let me appreciate it

00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,700
