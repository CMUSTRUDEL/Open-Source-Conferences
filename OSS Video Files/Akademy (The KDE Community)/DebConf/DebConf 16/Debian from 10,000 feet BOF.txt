either for the project project whatever

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,440
they would like to discuss maybe you

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,840
could copy the for example all the

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,720
strings I put them at the beginning of

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,720
the document and review them together I

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:36,980
put the other ones I just read it yeah

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,299
so other things I identified for exam

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:44,519
2014 where the strong shared common

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:46,290
ideas and goals among contributors we

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,060
are clearly a project where everybody

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:54,420
but mostly people he agrees about what

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,400
we are aiming at widespread agreement

00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,030
with foundational documents and

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,220
procedures everybody cares about

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,430
Debian's and likes it if you talk to the

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,709
outside world outside the back off lots

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,500
of people are really big fans of Debian

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,269
even when they are not shooting it I

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,780
have a large active community of

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:20,040
volunteers and we value independence

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,540
quite highly and we don't compromise

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:27,329
with it so the other ones I just

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,680
continue reading but Neal point it's a

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:36,170
social contract as it went I think it's

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:44,310
kind of even put in what's line for

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:48,810
foundation documents you can comment on

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:51,329
views mine were so there was

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,900
independence and I scratch it off

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,900
because it was in your list already

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,100
there is

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,840
history the project we've been doing

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,750
this for over two decades now we have a

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,190
committed reserves perience and so that

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,489
her work is ruined sisters after

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,269
breakfast community it's to make sure

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,980
that the structure is still working

00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,060
having an organization with the good

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:22,240
processes and having

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:27,970
I mean trying to avoid organizational

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:33,639
blockers inside the project the large

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:38,910
community so that's obvious largest

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:41,770
number of derivatives someone is editing

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:46,230
it you can duplicate with line six but

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:50,230
yeah 96 yeah largest package

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,790
repositories and figures of you have

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,700
technical excellence and commitment to

00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,560
free software I don't think it's

00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:01,410
necessary to command them they are

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,410
simple enough so what's missing

00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:15,389
way to the microphone because that yeah

00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:28,979
but several people are asking for all

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:31,110
your doings above us just Debian has a

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:49,490
strong reputation for stability and

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:52,139
doesn't seem to be captured up there I

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:56,059
think a strength of the Debian project

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,599
is also it's non-binding to corporations

00:05:56,059 --> 00:06:02,580
independence okay

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:04,709
it was listed already that's great it's

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:10,110
just a way to keep still early morning

00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:12,779
know that abide do you see that we serve

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:17,369
a time of independence

00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:21,089
maybe we could yeah detail in which way

00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:25,079
we are independent we are also

00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:28,999
financially independent but only what

00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:31,999
our goals but in our philosophy and our

00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,999
finances

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:43,870
and I was gonna say we we have a huge

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,610
number of very dedicated developers

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,169
making it better but there is large and

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,210
active community which I just saw now

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,830
maybe dedicated put that in there

00:06:49,210 --> 00:07:06,009
something like that because it's amazing

00:06:50,830 --> 00:07:14,979
what we do I mean seriously I think it's

00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:19,210
easier for the other so we have one so

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:22,599
once I identified back then one the

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,460
first one is the fact that we are one of

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,430
the few remaining large community

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,409
projects like I would say true community

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:34,000
projects but many other free software

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:39,000
projects that are kind of polluted by by

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,849
companies and I don't see pleased that

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,340
that much present in that younger folk

00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:48,669
who've met many developers employed by

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:59,380
companies to work on Debian but till the

00:07:48,669 --> 00:08:03,330
mainly contribute scroll down they

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:06,070
contribute to Debian with Debian heart

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:14,259
not with fair say collabora

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:19,300
art or whatever was a company HP the

00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:22,300
second one must be the the general post

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:26,490
Snowden Oct to watch some big corporate

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:32,760
players we are clearly seen as being

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:35,399
always with big players and we do that

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,159
twice I think it was mine

00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:45,510
means I didn't copy them because it's

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:49,950
honorable things on weaknesses cloud

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:52,529
service is about so yeah Zach made it

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,630
work at DEFCON 14 if I recall correctly

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:58,500
about which is different definition of

00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:02,399
free services cloud services and he made

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:06,830
a point about all the computing moving

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:10,740
from workstations to the cloud the

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:14,880
question was about how to make sure that

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:18,839
people still use free things there what

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,959
is about free services and also how to

00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:25,890
make sure that we are still relevant

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:28,500
like for example so there is the on

00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,760
cloud service I'm not saying it's clear

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,890
that you should the package it or

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,180
something but just it's something that

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:39,440
exists it's not packaged yet today in

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:42,600
Debian and got removed for some reasons

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:48,779
so somehow we are not enabling our users

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:52,980
to easily install such software and they

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:55,829
may use another instance publicly

00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:04,860
available for free and we don't know how

00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:09,089
its installed how is the how their data

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:12,510
in the service private or whatever so

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:17,630
the subject was about be made making

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,630
sure that we are working on

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:29,000
packaging those services also about

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,870
making sure that debian is easy easy to

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,910
install on the cloud platforms so for

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:39,830
now we still don't have maybe we fixed

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:44,209
it a bit but not exactly

00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:46,940
we don't have installers officially

00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:58,490
promoted by the project for like Amazon

00:10:46,940 --> 00:11:01,880
etc but our installers needed for Amazon

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:05,990
or other you just take image like ami or

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:09,440
some Google cloud image or or other

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:13,250
image like image of existing already

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,620
installed Debian casual installation and

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,360
and you just use it you about Amazon for

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,390
example I know there are multiple buyers

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,880
yeah so which one do you pick which one

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:26,390
has been promoted by the project which

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,920
one we have Debian images I'm not sure

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,700
whether they are officially blessed by

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,190
their named

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:35,450
Debian we have Debian squeal and on our

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:41,660
download page we only advertise easy

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:46,220
images and not the cloud things yet yeah

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:50,470
so there are no wiki what's okay so I

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:54,380
when i'm using debian on ec2 on amazon I

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:59,079
usually click create new instance and go

00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:03,860
to marketplace put dead young and and

00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:08,060
and just and just start this Debian

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,850
image so but at the same time I was

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:14,450
today at the azure presentation

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,829
and they collaborate they are doing

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,040
something really interesting like

00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:23,270
preparing every time building new amaz

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:26,540
new new tab young Debian images for a

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:30,960
stretch for wizzy and for

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:35,010
and for Jessie which is not the case for

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:39,720
example for for easy to for easy to we

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:43,800
only get new a new images when when we

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,880
release new sub list for example 8.5 or

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:52,380
something ladies so this means that we

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:55,100
and also we don't get relevant testing

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:58,230
images in easy to which means that

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,300
working with testing some of the new

00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,850
packages on Amazon is quite different

00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,640
quite difficult

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:08,460
I'm not sure what that guys in it with

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:13,850
Google I think we agree in the technical

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,850
status my main action was about this one

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:22,470
so what's being done and make sure it's

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:26,190
on the official download image page not

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:28,620
on some wiki page okay there will be pop

00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,930
for the cloud yes two hours or something

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,080
I don't know Steve is working on that

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:36,150
with his CD image hat I have to make

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,710
sure that the cloud the OpenStack images

00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:42,210
are being built by the official yeah

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:45,480
yeah no question I'm not sure what's the

00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:48,540
current status about that but at some

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,480
point it was quite so as a quite

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,420
difficult discussion about what does

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Debian image means on such public guys

00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,770
what's what are you allowed to including

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,900
the image by default even if it's not in

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:10,280
stable will easily think there is no

00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:14,460
original which gets the the criteria to

00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:17,370
is applied to each and every public

00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:21,000
cloud we have images for and not so sure

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:28,770
okay for now we don't advertise public I

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:31,660
mean official images so maybe maybe it's

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,939
applied but

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,180
yes maybe I should put the link about

00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:37,180
that

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:52,620
maybe just go on with the next item is

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:54,089
zero this way yeah it's only not only

00:14:52,620 --> 00:15:01,800
about French Arabic speaking countries

00:14:54,089 --> 00:15:06,149
actually it's about also Asia Africa

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:08,100
user from Africa Latin countries etc and

00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:11,250
make sure that for example we go there

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,760
make some talks I mean the project can

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:20,550
fund that so we have some very present

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:25,320
activity we have our project presented

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:30,810
in conferences there I know that a few

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:33,410
developers good for Sofia which is great

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:38,450
and we should be doing that for other

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:43,410
conferences it's a promotion effort

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:47,850
basically what do you see as a main loca

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:50,790
for improving just because we're going

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,920
to conferences is nice but it seems to

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,100
me that at least when I got involved

00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,110
main way people got involved wise by

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,470
because one of their friends wisely

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:04,709
working there so it's quite hard to just

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,089
describe a new geographical location

00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:08,459
just because you have nothing in the end

00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:10,140
but at least where where you go when you

00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,450
go there you have the opportunity to

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,060
meet people so you can encourage them to

00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:19,459
I mean talk to you even by mail that

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,459
later mentor them

00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:36,209
some comments off the internet

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,779
Jason's been making a quite a few posts

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,129
unfortunately it doesn't seem was

00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,490
streaming very well at the moment so it

00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:46,170
has been recorded so these may or may

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,980
not afford to be non via agenda

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:52,740
continuing the definition of free

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:57,459
software promotes its work within Debian

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:59,759
we taking sax talk and Debian DC 17w

00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:04,449
near the Dark Ages of free software

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,970
yeah we've covered most that considering

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:11,049
transform of the official website Debian

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:14,079
two org with less textual in textual

00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:18,069
interface to generate more visual appeal

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,419
and thereby facilitating access and read

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:24,250
content to the general public and

00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:26,530
potential collaborators trying to

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,900
attract more users new collaborators and

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:32,610
developers through the above two points

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:37,659
as well as other possible activities

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:43,690
please communicate in a yep I think

00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:46,179
we've covered was being asked for good

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,720
someone with access to is simply take a

00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,720
few notes

00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,479
[Music]

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:10,580
oh well maybe dancer tonight well Damien

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,620
is given at the middleman basically

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:20,450
where the interface between upstream and

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:22,400
uses 0r moves to waste application

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,930
building solution where basically we

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:31,370
would not no longer be needed I think it

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:33,710
makes sense for us to have our say in

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:37,280
this move and maybe embrace it rather

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:40,240
than refuse to accept it and continue to

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,880
keep our influence on the ecosystem

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,480
there I took this example I'm sure there

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:56,840
are other other similar cases that we

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:59,870
could find well we have at least our

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,000
upstream guide which is sort of our of

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:09,350
Officer recommendations for upstream

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,250
developers so maybe it's not well enough

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,250
advertised as well

00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:27,679
okay so I try to identify actions I mean

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:31,230
to do and to act on the opportunities

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:35,519
like doing some advertisement work for

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:39,809
the cloud services or images etc do we

00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:42,019
have ideas for the other items on the

00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:42,019
list

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:59,540
so for example for the website I don't

00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:59,540
know the status of the www team maybe

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,200
it's keeping up keeping up with bug

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:15,990
reports and stuff but not really bigger

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:17,670
things okay so basically nobody is

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,470
blocking it we are just looking for

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:21,720
volunteers to do the work like

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,670
converting the Sevilla stuff to get

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,690
which has been on the to-do list for

00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:30,330
years but nobody was yeah I do know that

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,070
the designer that we recruited this year

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,870
for Deb Kampf one of the first thing she

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,060
said is who the Debian website really

00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,590
needs some work which she has had no

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:41,310
time because we've had her working on

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,540
Deb comp but she might be recruited we

00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,790
did have a slight problem with getting

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:48,720
her to do free software tools so there's

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:52,130
some work there but but it's possible

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,130
and she clearly has skills

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:07,280
so about new contributors from countries

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,680
outside North America and Europe maybe

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,160
that's something that should be more

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,790
widely announced a sponsorship program

00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,260
for developers for gd's to go to

00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,970
conferences elsewhere ever to give talks

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,700
about the Gion tutorials about the gun

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:35,780
packaging that would have to be a good

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:38,450
use of do we have enough manpower if we

00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:41,630
would get I don't know few dozens of

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:45,880
contributors at which would need to be

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,880
mentored and guided at least initially

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,070
it's luxury problem to solve the day we

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,660
have thousands of contributors so I

00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:07,250
don't worry we will find enough work

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:14,240
freedom but sometimes it's touch I mean

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:16,280
that's the mushy stuff where you have

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,500
the montage saying what they are working

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,880
on Debian the mentees include other

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:28,070
interests in Debian and it helped to

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:29,630
make to start and they even managed to

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,320
find new volunteers for the committee so

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:39,230
it's really working minutes so the group

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:42,050
of persons so maybe there was the idea

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:46,010
of doing a welcome team actually in

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:49,970
Debian which could help people start

00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:53,000
doing things in Debian sometimes people

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,400
are don't know who to contact to act in

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,510
some area of the project so if you know

00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,770
already those guys and if

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:08,050
they've been enough you could do this

00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:11,230
first step related to that but I might

00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:14,800
give more of the weaknesses I think one

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,660
problematic external impression of what

00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,310
how you can contribute to Devon is that

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,380
you absolutely need to be a dependable

00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,320
Oprah I think we still haven't managed

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,810
to fix that and people all quite often

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,760
come and say well but yeah you know I'm

00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:35,040
not so DD so dot dot something excuses

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,040
but it's mostly our fault to probably

00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,830
come I take issue with that

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:44,650
can I take issue with that one I've not

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:47,110
been a DD I'm now a DD you but not

00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:50,890
uploading but that only happened a week

00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,810
after last year's DEP comp and that was

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,190
only because people were sort of say

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,800
look it's about time you actually went

00:23:54,190 --> 00:24:01,030
through the process I've been involved

00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,800
in the project for ten plus years no

00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,890
real issues whatsoever we contributing

00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:12,310
without being a DD it's purely an excuse

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:16,180
not to do something I don't think we

00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:18,580
disagree okay I I heard it is slightly

00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,830
definitely some my apologies well I mean

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,120
I I'm not saying it doesn't work I'm

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,220
saying there is an external perception

00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,010
that you need to have these sticks in

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,780
your profile to be able to contribute

00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:32,680
maybe my impression of this external

00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:37,090
perception is wrong but I'm glad it

00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:40,600
works it works fine there's plenty of

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:43,900
people around here today there's a lot

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:47,140
of the local team on on T DS I've been

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:49,960
doing it not awful lot on this because

00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,090
they've been to him but he's been

00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,530
suggested by friends and people that

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,470
have been working on it this is really

00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:58,800
cool to work on and becoming a DD will

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:03,720
be further down that line but it's not

00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,720
not necessarily seen as a stopping point

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,900
okay someone else want to comment other

00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:22,830
opportunities or should we move to their

00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:26,600
weaknesses yeah so just for the

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:30,149
this one highlighted other apps I

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:35,090
suggested maybe it could be part of the

00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:40,860
odd map because it's a wide archive

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:45,480
change and it fits there we then we only

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:48,929
need a driver for the idea what about

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:54,600
the liver CPU architectures who added

00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:58,889
that ok I added that like the question

00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:04,440
extra is actually what from Debian can

00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:06,889
we do - well everyone created four and

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,889
so forth

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:13,740
mostly that's referring to risk V

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,779
there's also the superhitch architecture

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,159
that's patents have expired in their

00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:22,950
reviving it as an open-source

00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:24,570
architecture yeah the problem with the

00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,309
risk away at the moment is the patches

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,500
aren't upstream yet and they're still

00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:37,909
revising their baby hours and stuff like

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:43,039
that okay on this one the lanista scope

00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:43,039
was about you know it was boutiques

00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:53,929
wasn't you well we haven't yet seen that

00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:57,049
year so it's through the portion T oh

00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:59,820
okay it's never coming just so you know

00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:01,169
think about mobile instead what's

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,940
actually happening as the desktop is

00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:03,960
going away entirely so don't worry about

00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,090
the year of Linux desktop

00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,779
who cares anymore do you worry about

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,779
mobile though

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:23,360
okay okay let me let's move to witnesses

00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:33,360
ready that fan was moving to witnesses I

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:36,570
already fixed yeah so some of the things

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,640
that were identified in the past is this

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:42,090
passion of manpower lack of manpower and

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:46,250
core things lack of interest in

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,250
contributors to non technical tasks

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,169
fragmentation lack of common technical

00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,820
practices in some areas fact that the

00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:56,010
fact that packaging is difficult to

00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,650
sleep it's the use of packages standard

00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:03,140
interface standard software distribution

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:06,299
mechanism it's difficult to get started

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:09,540
as contribute or lack of Passau

00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:12,890
requirement this connection from

00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:16,009
upstream for many packages

00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,009
[Music]

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:29,760
who is that who digs again I mean I

00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:32,820
think we have a teacher now who's under

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,130
35 since I mean it didn't happen since I

00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,590
don't know maybe ten years so it's a

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,990
good site good sign that you have

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:42,900
younger people the project well it's

00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,549
kind of this usual thing is that it it's

00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,910
common for us to think that we're

00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:49,260
getting old and we're maybe not looking

00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,940
correctly and we might just be missing

00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,380
that the young guard is actually coming

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,870
and there are actually people that are

00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,280
young better contribute but I still

00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,490
think the first part of the stand

00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,770
sentence that the H average is growing

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:03,299
stands and that's my dear weakness I

00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:08,130
mean it used to be a project for the

00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:09,720
20-ish people and now it's yeah we all

00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,679
have a bar that closes at 11:00 and we

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,480
are happy with it speaking speaking from

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,160
another open source project that went

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,410
through this same process I can tell you

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,570
it is a problem if you don't welcome the

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,669
new generations it means in another 10

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,020
years you're dead but this actually ties

00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:27,030
into the earlier thing we're talking

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,460
about small events in regional areas

00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,440
it's not even not even as big as a mini

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,330
dev Kampf even smaller

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,299
Ashish did something awesome which was

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,980
open hatch comes to campus he would

00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:40,350
connect with local user groups and run

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,720
it doesn't take even you know maybe if

00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,860
one Dede could go or even just someone

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,620
who kind of knows a little bit about

00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,919
Debian could go you can spin up these

00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:52,740
very small University events that get

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,410
university students excited about the

00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:59,600
project and that's probably the best way

00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,600
to get very young people involved

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:17,989
I could also in touch with the with my

00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:17,989
academic background in the past with the

00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:30,299
professor teaching teachers who wanted

00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:34,080
to do short internship and we could have

00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:39,720
a program within Debian for to have

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:43,229
people from other colleges to work on

00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,470
small tasks and it could be way to get

00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:45,470
in

00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:57,630
No okay talking about universities I

00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,890
remember when I was student we had some

00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:03,179
Linux user group locally now when I'm

00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:06,300
speaking with people who still keep up

00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:11,520
with my former University now its dotnet

00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:15,150
user groups from mobile programming some

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:18,020
gaming but I'm not sure if Linux user

00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:21,210
group even exists at my former faculty

00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,429
so that that might be the sign of the

00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,080
times changing and that might be also

00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:28,050
the one of the reasons that we don't

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,390
have new blogs because the because my

00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,460
first contact with Lino's was at the

00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:35,820
University and we we were exchanging

00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,860
some ideas we were exchanging some we

00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,230
were discussing about these draws flame

00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:45,090
lime in there I think we also have to

00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,500
update our speech when we are trying to

00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,300
reaching out to new users and

00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,460
communities because we always start by

00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,040
saying I could do for example the

00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,650
packaging tutorial but people are not

00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:58,800
interesting necessarily in packaging and

00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:02,240
we have to date our speech to find a new

00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:04,530
interesting tasks to do in the project

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,100
which will be appealing and interesting

00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,100
for our young people

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,740
so if if there aren't Linux users groups

00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,350
on campuses anymore is it because we

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,270
it's already a done thing and it's in

00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:30,860
the people are using it in the

00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:33,300
engineering programs or is it not oh

00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:38,310
yeah I'm own left to have a son in

00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:40,890
college and the connecting his computer

00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:43,950
to the internet you needed Windows or or

00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:47,000
Macintosh you know if you wanted to run

00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:50,340
Linux you had to run your own network so

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,390
but I know a lot of engineering programs

00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:56,580
are already using Linux so you know it's

00:32:54,390 --> 00:33:00,540
it's not only about the users groups

00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:03,510
it's you know do we have attention of

00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:08,520
the faculty and in incorporating Linux

00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:11,310
into the into the curriculum yeah I

00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:14,310
think that we are at absolute bottom

00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:17,730
bottom of the curve currently because I

00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:20,340
think that systems operating traditional

00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,740
operating systems courses are becoming a

00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:25,470
bit less relevant because nobody what we

00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,800
preserve not so much of a need for

00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,810
people with certain skills on the market

00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,090
at least probably less than 10 years ago

00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:38,100
because everybody is either a Linux Mint

00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:42,110
just works and at the same time not so

00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,110
many people who identify the need for

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:48,660
DevOps or managing large infrastructure

00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:53,240
skills which are more a mix of systems

00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:56,700
programming and she said meaning and so

00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,910
nobody is really teaching about those

00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:03,150
skills at the moment we can hope that

00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:05,370
will fulfill changes because many large

00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:09,389
companies run we large infrastructures

00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:11,159
rather need for people to produce a turn

00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:19,260
sometimes it is quite hard to find on

00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:23,069
the job market if I may your and your

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:25,319
idea so it seems like we have two

00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:28,049
problems one is the lack of role models

00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:30,059
of somebody who come to aspire like

00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:32,460
faculty using Kleenex and showing that

00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:35,099
you can do cool things and also lack of

00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,960
view like Linux now is seen as operating

00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,690
system yet another operating system like

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:44,760
like Mac or Windows or whatever and it

00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:49,710
it mostly works so it's not it's not

00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:54,269
seen as students and new fresh blood is

00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:56,970
not feeling they need to tinker with it

00:34:54,269 --> 00:35:01,380
and from this tinkering we had we had

00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:05,190
new new contributors so so we would need

00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:08,099
to find some idea to refresh indistinct

00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:11,730
I don't know maybe returning a little

00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:14,670
bit to the crowd maybe show them how to

00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:17,009
manage some few instances on the cloud I

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,950
know I recently got email from Google

00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:24,089
that they are providing some some

00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:29,119
credits to run some Google cloud on in

00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:29,119
academia so maybe get from this angle

00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:37,410
because when it comes to the new

00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,769
packaging I'm not sure if that's really

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:43,500
pressing issue we have over 50,000

00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:46,019
packages and it might be more more

00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,519
problematic now or orphaned or not

00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:49,519
really well my 10 packages

00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:59,470
staying with your academia theme

00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:03,010
certainly in the UK we're finding a lot

00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:08,740
of the colleges are demanding submission

00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:10,450
of tasks and reports in a particular

00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,599
system in a particular format and

00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:17,200
they're all demanding the neo document

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,609
in Word format or whatever there seems

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,290
to be a lot of effort has gone in to

00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:26,579
prevent it being submitted from from

00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:31,420
anything other than our office 365

00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:36,119
generated device almost as if and I were

00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:38,920
being carefully pushed out deliberately

00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,089
the universities don't want to take a

00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:49,890
submission of an electronic document

00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:52,780
from Libre Office even for PDFs they

00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:56,890
don't accept other things I mean like

00:36:52,780 --> 00:37:00,819
did you know they've now got that

00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:02,380
plagiarism certainly in the two

00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:07,060
universities I've had caught up with

00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:10,930
recently demanding document in a word

00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:15,119
format they run it through their anti

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:17,560
plagiarism scripts so it's expecting

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,980
somethings particular it then goes and

00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,230
processes it so what you've actually got

00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:26,890
there is freedom is being constrained

00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:28,720
intentionally to to provide a service

00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,700
which you must go down a particular vote

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,030
so they're expecting the students to be

00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:37,000
running on on Windows box or running on

00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:41,680
Mac so it's a tutoring problem among the

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,640
universities yes don't see if their

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,830
budgets are getting spoiled

00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,360
yeah but it's big a bit budgets being

00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:51,200
constrained but of course freedom is

00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,700
also a big constraint as a result still

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,620
I think this issue is a bit different

00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:59,390
from the one before the fact that people

00:37:54,620 --> 00:38:03,730
cannot use UNIX based systems at

00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:07,310
universities one problem the fact that

00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:10,340
University isn't teaching that much

00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:14,390
about the importance of linux-based

00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:16,940
systems for UNIX systems is another

00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:19,280
issue Amina so the one you mentioned

00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,320
applies to everybody at university the

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,120
second one he applies to capital science

00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,650
students in terms of recruiting

00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:35,900
contributors we mostly care about the

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:37,220
second group of people with also yeah if

00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:41,510
it's going to grow we're going to need

00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:42,920
to appeal to more than just our

00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,260
potential developers we could have to

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,510
appeal to our end users and our end

00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,280
users need to be everybody else so it's

00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:58,310
a larger piece of logic group of people

00:38:49,280 --> 00:39:02,120
to a building can rafael comment on the

00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:09,710
before the last one and clear decision

00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:14,960
processes are also really yeah mother

00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:16,640
sorry kind of assume that it's a little

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,800
bit self-explanatory especially the

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:25,160
first one but I guess it's it's the huge

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,140
picture or circle around how do we

00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:31,000
progress how do we make progress in the

00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:33,380
project and often there come some

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,590
controversial decisions that need to be

00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,870
made and some teams are really good at

00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:41,060
doing that now communicating upfront and

00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:44,570
then making the decision and just moving

00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,980
forward with it but it's not clear how

00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,840
that works how its expected from

00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,510
everyone in the project and for instance

00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,540
if if I wanted to drive a certain change

00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:55,120
in the project it's not clear um how I

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,859
even would get to the point of

00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,789
identifying who can make

00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:02,079
decision without going to a dr and i

00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:04,299
guess it ties in with the second point

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,140
that i made there the reluctant 'no

00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:09,220
story

00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:11,799
entrepreneurial initiatives which may

00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,779
well fail i have this feeling that and

00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:16,420
they're being we're we're all very

00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:18,369
protective of what we have of our brand

00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,619
of our project of our pride and

00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:23,049
everything and yet at the same time if

00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:26,349
we don't take risks and try some stuff

00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:29,049
out we're probably not going to be able

00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:31,109
to advance a whole lot and i've i've

00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:34,690
noticed a very strong decline in

00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:37,119
innovation capacity in the last decade

00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:40,769
in debian and maybe that's partly

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:44,200
related here so sort of embracing this

00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:45,759
this sentiment that it's okay to try

00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,259
something and if it fails then we'll

00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:50,499
just you know pick up the pieces and

00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:53,019
keep going rather than fearing that it

00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:55,569
might negatively affect the brand debian

00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:58,450
because if we're perceived to the

00:40:55,569 --> 00:41:02,910
outside as a as an innovative project

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:07,450
that try stuff i think that's gonna be a

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:10,200
better image debian even if some of them

00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:14,970
fail then if it's the sort of stagnant

00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:18,489
project so is it about promotion of

00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:22,119
individual projects well pretty much

00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:23,259
anything um it could i I was thinking

00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:25,720
when I wrote this I was thinking about

00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:27,489
the Partners Program for instance where

00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:30,220
some of this entrepreneurial freedom

00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:31,599
would be very helpful to have but I'm

00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,569
sure that it applies to many other

00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,009
things you know events probably less so

00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:37,720
the technical stuff I mean you're not

00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:41,769
gonna be like entrepreneurial about the

00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:43,869
technical innovation in some ways or we

00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:46,859
do have processes there but there's a

00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:49,509
lot more around I take for instance

00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:52,180
website design yeah I mean one of the

00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:54,069
reasons why we we do have an update

00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:57,279
website it looks better than ten years

00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:59,170
ago but there have been a couple of

00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:01,089
people trying to like you know make it

00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:03,039
mobile friendly responsive design and so

00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:04,839
on and so forth and while I'm sure that

00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:08,790
like a lot of people will be in favor of

00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:10,860
that the sentiment in the project

00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:13,620
if I had to describe it like that it's

00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:16,200
more like very very skeptical of the

00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:18,350
whole thing and so therefore when

00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,310
somebody approaches this they go like

00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,750
you know I don't really want to touch

00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,490
this project even with a broomstick

00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,950
because I'm afraid that I'm gonna get

00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:29,220
backlash whereas what we should have is

00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:30,960
is a a community where if somebody says

00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,430
I want to work on the website everybody

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,840
goes like yeah that's awesome we're

00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,400
looking forward to having your designs

00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,610
and then we'll provide feedback and so

00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,800
on rather than you need to know you are

00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:43,860
very conservative with what works

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,300
already and that that's also good I'm

00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:50,760
not saying that we should like start

00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:52,830
failing everything right but is sure

00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,210
that when we have new initiatives we

00:42:52,830 --> 00:43:01,430
tend to ask too much questions that

00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:05,580
eventually discourage the person who was

00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:07,860
instead of for example making a test bed

00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:12,390
so they can work on and show it to the

00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:16,230
people but failure and experimentation

00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:21,150
should also follow with some post-mortem

00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:23,640
or assuming that is felt or or post some

00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:27,540
roadmap for doing this like for example

00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:30,510
we have Debbie Android which was the

00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:34,560
result of google Summer of Code two or

00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:36,710
three years ago but student finished

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,410
this and this application was not

00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:44,610
touched in three years already so it's

00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:48,540
now obsolete it doesn't display

00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:52,710
correctly some of the box and it has

00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:55,380
only below 100 users so when you put

00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:58,940
Debian into Google Play Store it's one

00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:01,710
of first hit and it's not really good so

00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:06,300
should we try to do something with it

00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:08,120
like rewrite it with modern Android

00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:11,970
[Music]

00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:14,890
guidelines or I guess this goes a little

00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:17,569
bit with our social media presence or

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:20,390
because in my opinion if it would work

00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:23,269
it could be good good first point for

00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:26,960
somebody some Debian user to subscribe

00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:29,650
to some packs to so to to show what are

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:33,559
the version of some interesting packages

00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:36,710
we and at the same time a little bit

00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:40,009
less than our burden own on webpage

00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:45,140
because if some if somebody can look it

00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:50,019
on mobile application then then it's

00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:50,019
more modern more or hip for something

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,290
any other comments

00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:09,819
first

00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:26,920
so

00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:29,920
innovation capacity decline so looking

00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,540
at the first threat is or a second at

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,490
the end of the desktop and we already

00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,200
talked about cloud images under

00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:39,430
opportunities I think we should talk

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:42,609
about Debian on devices as a real

00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:45,940
opportunity if you look at BeagleBoard

00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:49,570
you look at raspberry pi there they're

00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:53,890
both using Debian today I think that's

00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:56,380
an opportunity you know if you look at

00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:58,990
the display case out front you see all

00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,180
those robots I'm willing to bet they're

00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:06,430
running something some type of embedded

00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:09,520
Linux so if you really think the desktop

00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:11,880
is is diminishing you know you have two

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,109
fronts to focus on the cloud and devices

00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,109
so we should really be looking at both

00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:31,290
we have only a few minutes left but

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:36,170
someone want to comment on some of the

00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:36,170
threats this tradition of my dad's

00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:55,359
if I won't be want to comment about that

00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:57,009
we have insider information that's what

00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:01,269
I was discussing was a reddit guy who

00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:04,690
told me well se-young many parts of the

00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:06,640
lower stack GCC and what's also after

00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:09,609
stacking genome everything and if where

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,499
that were to die we we would have many

00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:17,249
problems because well dinners would work

00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:20,109
much ross i mentioned for example that

00:47:17,249 --> 00:47:23,049
well right that there's a lot of laptop

00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:25,390
testing and many of the drivers actually

00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:29,890
do work because right at engineers fixed

00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:33,180
them I don't know how much truth it is

00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:35,799
but I think it's believable its

00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:43,539
brightest involvement there is important

00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:46,150
and well so it's a sort of not very

00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:48,160
realistic threats but still it might be

00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,739
nice to have more devilish people

00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:54,969
involved in the lower stack level where

00:47:50,739 --> 00:48:00,869
reddit is heavily involved so that

00:47:54,969 --> 00:48:00,869
equality disappears we have people left

00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:11,869
I want to comment on the on the

00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:15,400
containers as a solution to deploy

00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:19,190
applications and services sorry what

00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:22,220
okay which is identified that the as a

00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:25,700
threat but you could also look at it as

00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:28,930
an opportunity at work we are

00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:32,780
maintaining so a debian derivative

00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:36,200
internally based on stable so we have

00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:40,430
the old stable releases as well as

00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:42,950
testing many users are asking for a back

00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:49,070
part of some applications from released

00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:54,020
when an earlier release and what we

00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:58,270
found simpler is to have some process

00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:03,650
and programs to easily get applications

00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:05,750
run in containers from newer stable

00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:08,480
releases so it's technically very easy

00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:11,390
you just have to install a shoot and

00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:16,700
sell the packages there and make some

00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:20,630
scripts to run the application so it's

00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:22,790
easy to do and it's a way to say the

00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:28,069
people okay so if you manage to package

00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:31,280
it in like in testing you are not first

00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:35,359
to wait until it's released a stable to

00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,400
use it you can use it from today and we

00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:44,710
don't have such tools yet I mean Debian

00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:44,710
if so if we one minute okay

00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:54,980
yeah just work on some tools form

00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:58,700
containers it's a new technology and we

00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:01,070
didn't take advantage and we only look

00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,780
at it as a threat that could be an

00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:04,790
opportunity to make things simpler to

00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:08,240
distribute I think that generally we are

00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:12,260
not really and embracing all the new

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:15,920
ways to distribute software up to that

00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:18,470
potential one thing that is clearly

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,900
changing is that people want to use

00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:24,020
different versions of software and just

00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:27,350
use backports everything in back doors

00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:29,119
are not really a solution because most

00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:33,170
of the packages in median don't add back

00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:36,820
bolts one idea I've been playing for for

00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:41,800
a Bandhan admired for a long time is

00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:44,450
trying to do automatic backporting I

00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:48,710
wonder how many of our packages would

00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:50,420
just work if we just put them on the for

00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:54,920
the target distribution and provide them

00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:57,980
as a untested stuff to users most of our

00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:01,430
users just do that from source and we

00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:02,869
are out of time so I'm stupid but that's

00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,580
something that way if you're interested

00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:14,440
in working on that I'm interested in

00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:14,440
