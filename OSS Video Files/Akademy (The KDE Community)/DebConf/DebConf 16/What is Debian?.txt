hello everyone um this panel started

00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,620
because Bedell suggested that panels are

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,090
awesome but I think we're going to rope

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,900
him into yet another ones equality

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,509
another conference

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,880
it also started because I'm failing you

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,400
to open source software and hardly I'm

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,730
very new to Debian you won't believe it

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,289
and I'm really confused about how Debian

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,019
and open source and all of these things

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,599
fit in video said he could give a talk

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,420
but then I realized that people are new

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,219
to Debian and open source and really

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,710
from the discussions in the paws days

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,719
even people are long not new anymore

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,040
still have very conflicted views and

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,500
different angles and different entry

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,989
points so what I hope to achieve through

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,760
this kernel is a conversation between a

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,829
lot of very interesting people but also

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,809
conversation from the audience

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,700
whenever you don't understand something

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,800
or when you have a different opinion so

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,289
we can really cover the whole space or

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,239
as much as we can about what is Debian

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,600
and how does it fit into the open-source

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,969
movement and before I ask the panelists

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,339
to introduce themselves how technical is

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,799
this audience how low should we start us

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:14,479
or that anyone is absolutely new to

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:21,150
Debian and software other than meat okay

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:24,000
right so after I couldn't lie at least

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,820
so so can I start with Steve can you

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,689
introduce yourself we work our way down

00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:33,030
Beadle John Neil and Alison I'm just a

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,470
newbie on that gopher around here and

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,600
then we start with the most basic

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:41,579
question what is open source okay so

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,470
whenever you don't over mic please run

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:48,360
the mic hi I'm Steve McIntyre I got

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,390
involved in Debian back when I was still

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,920
an undergrad just under 20 years ago I

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,899
haven't quite worked out a way to escape

00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,119
yet I have been DPL for a couple of

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,040
years as hope will you'll hear this

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,649
there's other similar experience around

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,299
here I've done all kinds of jobs in

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,099
Debbie and I still keep on finding new

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,090
and interesting stuff to work on and new

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,069
people to talk to

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,210
it's really good funding and Steve

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,580
you're really involved in open

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,760
as well that's like a carrot isn't a

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,710
little bit involved an open hardware war

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,430
case of Andy keeps on press ganging us

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,380
to help make his project work and again

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,950
that's that's really good fun it's it's

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,900
another thing to play with Thanks I'm

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,610
video I tell people I made my first

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,350
personal contribution of source code to

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,840
what we later started calling free

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,940
software in about 1979 and I've been

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,940
actively involved in one or more

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,770
projects ever since I started working

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,880
for the old hewlett packard test and

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,470
measurement in summer of 1986 and

00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,230
despite a couple years of being off on

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,390
early retirement and a little waving to

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,740
and fro as the company has split and

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,590
recombine and all that sort of thing

00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,390
leading me to briefly work for one of

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,790
the spin-offs i've been involved with

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,720
the company now pretty much for all the

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:09,330
time since 1986 announced it as a fellow

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,680
in hewlett-packard enterprises office of

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,330
the CTO where my principal

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,240
responsibility is to articulate the

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,690
company's open-source strategy like

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,100
steve i was once a DPL some of you may

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,390
or may not have noticed that I was on

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,700
the Technical Committee for a little

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,680
while as well I've been very involved in

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,780
infrastructure things in Debian since

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,060
the earliest days of my engagement I

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,580
have to admit that in recent times I've

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,620
mostly been involved in helping other

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,110
people figure out sort of what the point

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,820
of Debian is in their context why I

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,250
think they ought to be using it instead

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,380
of something else I do still maintain or

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,120
try to maintain or do a really bad job

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,640
sometimes of maintaining a handful of

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
fairly important packages but other than

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,030
that I have no official rules anymore

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,030
which is kind of interesting and cool

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,330
I'm John Sullivan and the executive

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,210
director at the Free Software Foundation

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:07,690
I've been at the FSF since 2003 which

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:13,000
was also the first time I use Debian and

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:14,560
I became a Debian developer in 2010 but

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,450
became executive director at the FSF

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,110
shortly after that at which point just

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,030
about all of my free time evaporated so

00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,460
I have not forgotten to do as much work

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,890
in Debian as I hope to but I still do

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,990
try to find ways to contribute plan to

00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,370
take this week in particular as a chance

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,430
to fix some of the long-standing

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,630
problems with my packages in addition to

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:40,300
people wouldn't learn about all their

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:41,560
interesting projects and they'll

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,960
probably think it's fair to say I'm the

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,540
least technically knowledgeable person

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,520
on this panel so what got me into free

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:53,020
software had a lot more to do with the

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,930
distaste for provide Terry software

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,820
being forced upgrade over and over and

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,050
having to buy a new hardware that in

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,540
order to keep up with the latest

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,390
operating system and then also I have a

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,380
background and creative writing and was

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,570
engaged and a lot of collaborative

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,980
projects on that side of things which is

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,570
another point of interest for me and

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,740
Debian is just that idea of and free

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,450
software in general is the idea of

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,850
collaboration working with other people

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:22,120
to produce something great so there's

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:23,710
space for us non-id people in after

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,940
starting as a Debian user and after

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:30,820
starting at the other side cool coat my

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:34,840
name's a new McGovern and I've been

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,400
involved with Debian since about 2000 or

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,419
so worm something I found in that

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:46,419
various different roles from security

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:48,419
team press lots of release management as

00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:51,300
well so a number of the releases were

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:55,090
kind of a I saw helped along with those

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,300
until fairly recently I was a Debian

00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:02,040
project leader fortunately I found some

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:05,169
other poor person to take on that rather

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,750
illustrious role for those who are

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:09,940
watching the recording or or online he

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,020
sat in the audience so it's his fault

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:19,210
now just blame him for everything you're

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:23,320
very successful yeah yeah exactly

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,690
so I I have an action I I didn't manage

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,820
to I think for the past seven or eight

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:32,740
years not to maintain any packages in

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:34,540
Debian at all which means that less work

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,270
personally for me and those things go

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,220
wrong but you have also I think along

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,070
with be Dell been involved with various

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,180
other organizations around free software

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:48,160
as well so software in the public

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:50,110
interest which similar to Conservancy is

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,440
a nonprofit which helps support other

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,900
projects so it's been seen quite a bit

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,270
of the good the bad and the ugly of of

00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,830
how free software communities and then

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,830
Debian has all grown up over the years

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:10,030
so I was a free software developers in

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,820
the 90s and Debian was my first linux

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,470
distro also in the 90s a few years later

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,840
a few folks came along with this name

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,060
open source so when I use the word open

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,350
source I actually mean the same thing as

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,150
free software but I know that's not true

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:26,980
of everyone just for me they are

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:29,560
synonyms let's see I have never been DPL

00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,400
of Debian but I have held DPL like roles

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,930
in a couple of other projects so

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,030
currently I also work at EULA Packard I

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:40,210
manage a team that does all open-source

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,280
development and I'm a president of the

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,250
open source initiative as well as on the

00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,100
board of the OpenStack Foundation and

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,280
the Perl Foundation I don't get to write

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,440
a lot of code right now but every chance

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,110
I get I do some you know weird little I

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,820
don't know contributions statistics

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,460
tracking per Python code just to keep

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,670
myself and going entirely insane but I

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,260
think once I you know move on you know I

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,570
always think eventually I you know I'll

00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,060
be on the open-source board for maybe

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,490
three more years and then in all three

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,320
uptime it's my last year organizing deb

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:21,790
conf so then i'll free up time and I'll

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:23,080
get back to code will see miss everyone

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,830
else that's mentioned when they joined

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,520
Debian I am joined Debbie in the fall

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:31,550
1994 actually and before the first

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,100
stable release so it's been a while

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,110
cool I joined debut last year very good

00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:40,160
thank you very much okay so now is your

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:43,070
chance to be eterna fide in a quipped if

00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,990
you could write in a shortish quote what

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,170
is debian and how does it fit into the

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:52,310
free software movement what would you

00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:55,430
say you want that to be short Twitter

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:57,410
tweet okay hmm maybe a little bit longer

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,990
well the clipping quote is life's too

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:04,220
short for a secret source software I've

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:06,800
used that on before it's not there so at

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,110
some point somebody wrote it up as

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,690
Debian is an association of individuals

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,910
who have made common cause to create a

00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,160
free operating system and I actually

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,930
still really like that I think if you

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,700
disassemble that and sort of look at

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,400
what the pieces of it say and what it

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,250
means that there's an awful lot captured

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,080
in that relatively short assertion an

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,440
association of individuals it's not a

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,630
company even if many of us have the

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,570
luxury of being employed full-time by

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,450
companies to do work that's part of or

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,610
related to debian the reason we're here

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,380
is largely not because of that

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,120
employment we've been able to figure out

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,370
how to get paid to do what we love as

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,800
opposed to you know doing something just

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,780
because we're being paid to do it

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,610
and I wouldn't in that sense pretend to

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,560
speak for everybody but it's been my

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,360
observation that in the main that's true

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,790
and certainly of the folks who you know

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,410
make the effort to come in some cases

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,850
very far around the world to be it

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,560
something like DEFCON for every year no

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,730
matter where it is I think that's very

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,770
true who've made common cause we've also

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,830
have agreed to work together fairly

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,420
early in the history of the project when

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,750
the number of participants started to

00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,420
grow we ran into this problem where the

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,460
casual informal communications with each

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,610
other wasn't sufficient to ensure that

00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,650
everybody had a common core shared set

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,020
of core values and sort of all agreeing

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,790
on what we're trying to do that led us

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,850
to draft this thing called the social

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,010
contract which at the time was kind of a

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,390
new idea in the IT world I mean the

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,370
notion

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,650
she had a project that explicitly made

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,260
sort of a set of commitments to its

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,180
users it doesn't seem so strange now

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,740
lots of other projects have done similar

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,340
things but at the time it was sort of

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,260
novel and in the process of that we

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,750
realized that we kept saying free and we

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,980
had to define what that meant which led

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,430
to the creation the Debian free software

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,830
guidelines as almost an appendix to the

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,780
social contract a necessary thing to

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,420
explain what we meant in our contract

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,850
and then you know later that was picked

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,990
up and modified somewhat to become the

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,320
basis of the open source definition

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,390
which OSI has ever since used as the

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,020
litmus test for deciding what is and is

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:22,380
not an open source license which it

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,750
means that Debian has had this sort of

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,820
significant role in helping to define

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,090
where some of the intellectual

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,620
boundaries are that sort of constrained

00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,930
sort of where the edges of our community

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,430
are to create a free operating system

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,100
our free software I don't remember

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,590
exactly what the phrasing was but again

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,210
the emphasis on free and the fact that

00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,950
it was you know more than one program

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,380
it's an aggregation of a lot of pieces

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,970
to you know to create an operating

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,780
system that a lot of folks could use and

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:54,370
then later someone other than me

00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,650
asserted this notion of Debian the

00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,380
universal operating system I picked up

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,690
on that big time when I was writing my

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,110
platform for my second attempt the one

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,360
that was successful at becoming GPL and

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:10,450
I'm tickled that even today that is a

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,250
meme that still shows up frequently in

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,010
people's conversations about dubbing the

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,170
notion that we can be and should be

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,230
whatever we collectively are willing to

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:23,020
work on together and it doesn't matter

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,180
whether that's a great operating system

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,670
for really huge computing infrastructure

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,530
which is part of what my employer is

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,170
interested in these days or whether it's

00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:35,590
the cool new thing for something deeply

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,030
embedded which lots of us have had the

00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,520
opportunity to play with various devices

00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,280
over the years they really can you know

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,460
the the fact that we support as many

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,590
processor architectures and as many

00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,930
native

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,690
languages and as many other things as we

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,790
do makes us somewhat unique in the free

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,940
software world and all of those things

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,520
together in my mind make this a really

00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,160
unique really special really important

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,200
community and the things that we decide

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,770
the decisions we make the technical

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,150
choices that we deliver in the software

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,450
that we package up and make available

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,710
end up having really widespread

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,450
implications and ramifications through

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,180
all of the free software the world

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,010
thanks can I get the rest of the panel

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,790
opportunity to add to that and then we

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:25,640
can take a round of questions coming

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:28,730
there's also quite a significant social

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,350
aspect to Debian which we've passed on

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,040
to a lot of the rest of the free

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:36,710
software open-source world we have been

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,450
famous various points for for having

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,600
flame wars on our mailing lists and

00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:45,350
having really deep disagreements but

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,030
we've also kept a you know many hundreds

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,340
and now into thousands of contributors

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:54,680
working together on the things that

00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:57,080
matter we've helped with guidance for

00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,050
younger projects for other projects as

00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:04,040
well over this time we've demonstrated

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:08,390
how you can actually focus on just

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:12,320
producing a really good cool system but

00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,910
that we then not only a weak packaging

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,220
up pieces of the stream with we're

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,800
developing our own technical solutions

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,460
and then we're giving it away we're more

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,440
than happy for hundreds and hundreds of

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,480
other groups to just take the pieces of

00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,210
Debian that they like embellish with

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,010
their own changes and pass on themselves

00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,660
you know we're not jealous of what we do

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,760
we absolutely we're over the moon that

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,880
we can share it and they can continue

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,410
sharing it's really really awesome to

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,410
just be part of such a big community

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:51,990
I so I think in addition to these

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,240
elements of a community and an actual

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,580
software project and kind of a set of

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,240
really important documents I think that

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:02,100
for me a Debian is evidence that I don't

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,900
have a short 50 way to say this but it's

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,280
evidence that that's something that a

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,680
lot of people say could never have been

00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,630
done got done and can't continue to be

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,470
done you know and this is something that

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:15,300
I that really I connect with strongly

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,280
both from the FSF and being a

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,040
contributor to Debian is that you know

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,810
we're pushing the envelope in technical

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,100
terms you know having the same operating

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,630
system run on so many different

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,700
platforms and to serve so many different

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,140
purposes that it can be the same

00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,000
operating system the power as a server

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,300
and as like a really flashy a nice

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,560
desktop for a computer user that's using

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,770
their computer just to get other things

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,210
done besides write code and also the

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,370
commitments you're doing all of that

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,290
with just free software you know how

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,390
many manufacturers are telling us well

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,890
you can never have a laptop that doesn't

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,680
require some proprietary software you

00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,940
can never do these things with all free

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,370
software you can never certainly never

00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,350
do these things without paying people to

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,970
do them you'll never get just volunteers

00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,600
and people doing this out of the

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:03,330
goodness of their own heart but you know

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,800
they seem to be wrong and it's a mix you

00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,620
know people who are being paid to do it

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,830
and people who are doing it just out of

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,610
love and fun and I think that

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,380
demonstrating that all those things are

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:19,560
possible one could be successful was an

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:20,190
amazing thing about what Debian is it's

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,380
not mine

00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:28,310
but I've heard the Debian project

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,990
described as a bit like making sausages

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,370
as in they're very very tasty but you

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,480
don't want to look too closely as to

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,480
exactly how they're made

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:45,800
so yeah but part of it spicy sauce yes

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:48,850
yes and part of it is I think we have to

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:52,300
remember it's the debian not as a

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:55,250
product as a just generating the

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,740
operating system it is as a project

00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,420
itself so it's not just being able to

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,180
put together this very operating system

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:07,459
it is the way that you have thousands of

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:10,430
people who work online and were

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,020
distributed in a way that hasn't well

00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,420
certainly when it first started was a

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,120
very rare thing and everyone being able

00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,670
to pull together and similarly as part

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:24,050
of our social contract is that we do

00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:26,420
this all in the open and we don't hide

00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,490
our problems so if there's bugs they're

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,550
all open anyone can see them anyone can

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:34,550
see where the issues are and certainly

00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:43,690
the reputation of some of our mailing

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:46,700
lists like Debian developer times is

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,410
simply an example of I think you have in

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,820
other organizations as well where

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,450
there's arguments it's just we don't

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:56,510
hide them we are open and we allow all

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,700
our users and the community to see and

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,590
then be able to also get involved in

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,480
that process as well so that that's one

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:06,890
of these all key things behind the the

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:10,160
project itself for me agree with

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,960
everything they said my perspective is

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,270
odd for a long time I've ended up

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,000
working in open source as ecosystem so

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,410
it's not just like one specific project

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,690
I've done deep dives and one specific

00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:23,120
project but debian is fascinating

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,800
because it is a specific project with a

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,710
specific culture and community but it's

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,740
also in a sense all of free software and

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:33,290
open source because it is an

00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:36,290
intersection of a massive amount of code

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:39,380
from a massive amount of diverse

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:44,990
cultures and coding styles and languages

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:47,780
and projects and and it serves an

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,530
important function of making sure that

00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,560
all

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:54,800
that works together you know like just

00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,240
having a language that's free software

00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,580
okay that's fine but it's just a

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,350
language floating around by itself

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:04,520
actually turning it into an integrated

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:11,150
system is a massively complex problem

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:12,980
but I I i think probably before before

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,020
Debbie and folks would have mostly said

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:19,430
oh you would need a big company managing

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:21,230
that that's just not possible so and I

00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:25,520
think it serves as an important example

00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:27,140
of how to make software usable and I

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,700
don't necessarily mean usable and the

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,990
sense of pretty design that is important

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,460
to we need more of that but that that

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,410
sometimes usability is about the

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,180
plumbing part and it's not it's not the

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,740
fun part it's not the shiny features

00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,590
part but it's about really getting the

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:47,000
plumbing right and and keep keeping on

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:49,220
maintaining it yeah I was gonna say I've

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,620
also heard Deming described as an

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,570
instance proof of the validity of the

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,540
free software collaborative development

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,650
and engineering model and it's kind of

00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,540
interesting there a couple of other

00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,980
things not just sort of foundational

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,400
documents but a couple other interesting

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:08,540
things that Debian chose early on

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,310
because of the intellect or insights of

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,100
some of the early key folks in the

00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:15,500
project that have been observed and in

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,240
some cases copied by others our

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,150
preference based voting system for

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,330
example oh how I wish the United States

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:27,140
presidential election use the preference

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,220
based voting system you know there's a

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,980
lot of things the rest of the world

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,260
could learn I think from some of the

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,030
things we've done because while we have

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,310
occasionally had serious knockdown

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:39,110
drag-outs about technical in some cases

00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:43,100
even cultural questions within the

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:45,140
project we have the structural mechanism

00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,480
to deal with them we can have nasty

00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,400
discussions we can disagree with each

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,260
other strongly on technical on other

00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,060
matters and at the end of the day we can

00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,730
put forward a set of alternatives and

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,970
vote on the

00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:59,460
and almost everybody goes yeah okay may

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,990
not be what I really wanted but we sure

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,200
know what the consensus of the project

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:06,840
is now let's just carry on and that's

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,940
something I think the world at large you

00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,410
know other projects have looked at and

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,470
there's there's lots of things like that

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:17,130
I think others could learn from so the

00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:19,010
thing that I'm wondering slightly off

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,390
the topic here maybe the things that

00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:25,560
take a round of questions okay pick that

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:27,690
up one of the things that really

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,850
attracted me to Debian when I first got

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,390
involved only it only ever got stronger

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:35,840
is the idea that because we have a such

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:39,000
a large group of people working together

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,890
with some agreed constraints what you

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,930
know in our foundational documents and

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:46,740
some of the designs of the system we

00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:48,390
have we can between us make what's quite

00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,160
clearly the best operating system on the

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,880
planet the most flexible the most

00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,380
powerful in almost every respect yet we

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,000
can get we can all contribute if they're

00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,240
bits and pieces that don't work the way

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,590
you'd like them you can help you can fix

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,020
things if if they're books

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,520
equally though are these several

00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,680
thousand other people who you may not

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,090
have met yet but you can trust them to

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,830
basically do the right thing they're

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,730
your friends they're people who want to

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:16,650
work with you so it just extends your

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,600
capabilities that much further just

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,020
because we can all share in in all of

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,020
our effort

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,920
as a question

00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:49,719
so when my then-girlfriend Joe and I got

00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:50,139
got first got together she had a Windows

00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:52,109
laptop

00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:55,269
look now this is this is not uncommon

00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:58,619
she was coming around regularly and my

00:22:55,269 --> 00:23:01,539
housemates and and I he he's also a DD

00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:03,909
we were both hacking away on all that

00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:05,499
tops and running things after a few

00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:08,049
weeks coming around whatever she

00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:11,799
complained so why don't your computer's

00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:14,559
crash what's wrong what am i doing and

00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:16,299
then after a few more weeks and we

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,070
explained Oh No you might struggle with

00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:20,169
this you know we'll happily show you she

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,789
was a little bit taken aback about this

00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:24,700
totally different way of doing things

00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:26,859
and then eventually we got her a new

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,059
laptop we installed Debian on it she's

00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,399
been using it ever since

00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:34,659
absolutely hates anything else it just

00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:40,779
works she's now going through the non

00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:43,149
uploading debute and Debian so whatever

00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:44,769
yeah she's going through the process

00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:46,749
right now here we go man on uploading

00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:48,339
didi she is one of us she just hasn't

00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:53,320
hasn't filled in all the paperwork yet

00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:55,029
right so some are wife and kids are all

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,979
Debian users I'm on the first out of

00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:59,799
country from my parents and and due to

00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:03,549
weird twists in earlier parts of my life

00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:05,799
their Mac users and every time they have

00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:09,549
a problem I just apologized says I have

00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:11,139
no idea how to help I could spend all

00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:13,149
afternoon telling the funny stories of

00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:15,039
how my wife and each of my kids ended up

00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:17,429
running Debian each for different

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,629
reasons and with different motivations

00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:21,249
suffice to say they all came to it in

00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:23,739
relatively natural ways and I don't

00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:25,299
think it would occur to any of them not

00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:27,279
to want to run something else right now

00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:29,109
my son's about to head off to university

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,239
for a mechanical engineering program and

00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:33,339
he knows that he has to have his laptop

00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:34,640
set up to dual boot windows because the

00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:37,820
university uses a

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,380
mechanical CAD stuff that's made

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,910
available to the students for free while

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,590
they're students and it all runs on

00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,990
Windows and he knew he had to do that so

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,420
we've helped get the machine set up for

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,190
that but he was absolutely insistent he

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,750
was not going to school without a debian

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:57,830
instance also available on the machine

00:24:50,750 --> 00:25:01,220
because he needed a real computer too it

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:03,559
seems like people close to me and my

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,299
family seem to be beset by the kinds of

00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:07,340
problems that are plaguing us as a

00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:09,610
broader movement which is very specific

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:13,850
requirements for proprietary software

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:15,290
for school programs professional and so

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,059
that's one place where I draw

00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:20,720
inspiration to try to work on fixing

00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:23,809
those things but you know I try to do

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,470
helpful things like run services for

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:30,260
friends and family using Debian main

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:33,049
normally so that they can not rely on

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,250
Google as much and still have some of

00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:36,230
the same features that they would get

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,610
from doing that so I try to help fill in

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,400
you know host websites where people help

00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,410
them set up their WordPress installs so

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,240
those places where free software is way

00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,620
ahead and then just try to you know keep

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,470
a list of all these challenges we have

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,850
to tackle all the educational online

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,850
school programs that are starting to

00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,290
require proprietary software or at the

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,090
very least you know proprietary plugins

00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:59,059
and browsers in order to work and then

00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,650
both in FSF and as a I've been

00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:07,220
contributor to try to help get those

00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:09,200
problems solved and so my partner she

00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,600
works for the same organization as me

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,049
collabora we do free software

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:18,669
consultancy so everyone at work uses

00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:20,780
Debian every day on their desktops and

00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:22,520
no you first I think the first one is

00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:27,440
here is your laptop it is running Debian

00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:30,470
congratulations so but I think the sort

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:35,080
of interesting one is sunny a bit

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:37,160
broader which is exactly where Debian is

00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,059
because it's in a lot of places that

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,040
people don't expect either dead things

00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:46,190
that eventually come back to Debian so

00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,660
our Debian or Debian disk or derivatives

00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:52,300
I was giving you a

00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:55,670
talk at Lynn its targ in in grass and

00:26:52,300 --> 00:27:01,120
the guy who was organizing it said let's

00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:04,550
go to his lap and he does genetic

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,170
sequencing for diagnosis of cancers and

00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,000
various other things and the actual

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:11,060
sequencing machines are all actually

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,830
running Debian or if you got a flight

00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,170
here certainly from Europe then it's

00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:17,270
highly likely you touch day the air

00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,400
traffic control was running a debian

00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,620
base it was very interesting actually

00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,340
years ago I got invited to do a customer

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:28,370
visit to a major airline in Europe and

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:30,410
our field sales guys were curious as to

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,450
why I had been invited because they said

00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:34,070
they basically don't do any Linux we

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,300
think they've got to Red Hat machines

00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,370
running Oracle or something but

00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,040
everything else is something else and I

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:43,580
right yeah it was something else it was

00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,990
all Debian they weren't bothering the

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,490
sales guys about it because at that

00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,170
point in the history cutting the company

00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,000
didn't officially support that as an

00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,980
operating system on the servers we all

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,270
know it worked and we sold a hell of a

00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,160
lot of hardware to a lot of people who

00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,510
are running it but you know I got

00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,860
invited I spent a very pleasant day

00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,380
wandering around and learning all the

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,480
crazy things that people were doing and

00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,400
we're just expecting it to work and it

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,980
was fun riding the trip report up from

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:11,900
that trip my son's going through a

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,090
teenage rebellion phase where he has

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:18,530
rejected the Linux he was raised on and

00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:20,420
now has Windows sometimes you do have to

00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,870
give him room to grow up and discover it

00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,100
for themselves no I mean most most of my

00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,410
close friends both technical or

00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,410
non-technical use Debian or a derivative

00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,980
of Debian my family

00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:38,030
Mike's siblings and my mother are very

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:40,850
Mac oriented I've introduced into things

00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:42,860
but my dad was was very into Linux so I

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,720
don't know it seems to Barry it's a it's

00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,640
a mixed bag but I do have the experience

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,340
of very very non-technical folks who are

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:54,050
completely comfortable on Debian or

00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:55,820
other Linux distributions and I'm not

00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,580
using David yet but I do have an a bunch

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,530
of artisan and I was hoping to install

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,110
Debian yesterday but I got distracted

00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:08,210
like August oh you could probably find

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:10,340
somebody to help you sometimes it's got

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:12,440
its finally got the Debian sticker on so

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,280
so you're half way that it should get it

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,080
yep

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,690
there's also Windows partition on day

00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,910
and my work works in Microsoft Office

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,290
and we spend about half the day everyday

00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:25,400
waiting for documents to stop hanging

00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:28,970
nevermind that I tell them about things

00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:31,070
like waiting so I think it's just a

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,680
exposure thing and I want to agree with

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,690
Peter that there's there's the user face

00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,370
but there's also word-of-mouth and the

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:40,040
more technical stuff and I think it's

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:41,570
superficial to just focus on and I think

00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,130
I guess it was Neill saying it's sort of

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,050
interesting that Debian shows up in

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,640
places you don't expect and a lot of

00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,620
folks not know about um I've talked

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,590
about this in talks at other Deb cops

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,810
before but some funny little stats a few

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:58,880
years ago actually when Martin Luther

00:29:53,810 --> 00:30:00,470
Mayer was BPL HP at that time came up

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,360
with an interesting product called

00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:05,240
Debian gnu/linux with HP telco

00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,970
extensions and it was sold in a bundle

00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,410
with a night a Neum based server and

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,420
there were two really interesting stats

00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,490
to me about that product number one is

00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,470
the number of systems of that that we

00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,900
sold to the three customers who bought

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:20,750
them who happen to be OEMs for all of

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:24,500
the telcos in the world bought more

00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:26,450
Itanium processors than the at that time

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:30,050
estimate of the size of the Itanium

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,340
market so that one product sold more

00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,620
than most people thought that whole

00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,300
market size was and the second

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,950
interesting stat is I was told by

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,870
someone definitively in the middle of

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,700
that era that one-third of all mobile

00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,650
phone calls in the world every day

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,560
touched one of those systems somewhere

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,850
during the call process and the

00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,500
interesting thing is those are all

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,600
running on private networks they're not

00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,910
on the internet or somehow externally

00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,080
visible and the kernels that were built

00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,210
for them at all

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,580
you know we're required to have lots of

00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,870
nines of uptime reliability because they

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,240
didn't want to boot reboot those

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,310
machines for ten years and that's an

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,720
interesting set of requirements it's the

00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,850
reason that when we were first in

00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,770
titanium enablement in Debian I knew

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,600
every time we uploaded a kernel package

00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,250
to Debian that it had actually survived

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,370
all of our torture testing in the

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,200
it was probably the most robust Colonel

00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:21,080
builds that you know existed within the

00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,730
distro you know that's an interesting

00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,290
little fact of history and I have no

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,120
idea how many of those I mean it hasn't

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:30,070
been 10 years yet so I bet you a bunch

00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,070
of those systems are still running but I

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,570
don't want to think it but you know

00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,890
they're all at remote cell sites so it's

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:38,450
probably the thing keeping the

00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:41,630
electronics warm on the top of the

00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:43,220
mountain in the winter I used to use a

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:45,620
90mm server to dry my hair in the

00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:48,170
morning in the basement for that another

00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:51,230
story I just have such a Marilyn Monroe

00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:55,210
image right now executive server and

00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:57,560
your head when we were first doing a

00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,150
Linux enablement on them they sent me

00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,490
one of the prototype servers and the

00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,100
base port management processor firmware

00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:06,760
was very naive it ran the fans full

00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,760
speed all the time

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,000
you

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:10,470
every day in mind Thursday dad in so she

00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:20,609
had the schedule a while she was here or

00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:22,589
delegate someone the thing that Debian

00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:31,799
should be what Debian is not currently

00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:34,910
and should be are we going to write so

00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:38,819
I've got a reproducible answer from Andy

00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:41,549
do we have anyone backing that up that

00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:45,299
one mildly controversial answer I guess

00:35:41,549 --> 00:35:48,030
I'll go for so official Debian Debian

00:35:45,299 --> 00:35:51,440
main is 100% free software

00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:54,359
Debbie Anna's of projects still supports

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,089
non-free software as required for its

00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:00,180
users so I think we think about what

00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:03,650
Debian could be it could be in the long

00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:07,220
term a way to make non free non-issue

00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:10,400
that's one thing that'd be cool a

00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,400
question over here

00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:21,470
languishing in the darkness of it I said

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,470
it's dark over there nobody could see

00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:01,320
so I'll answer the first one of those

00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:03,780
because that's quite easy I still have a

00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:07,020
Nokia n900 running my mo a Debian

00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,820
derivative it's an O it's the most it's

00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:11,070
the best phone I've ever had because it

00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,900
happens to be a little ARM based Debian

00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,480
computer that happens to know how to

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,730
talk to USM and stuff

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,420
I'll let somebody else answer the harder

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:23,730
question well the easy question I'm

00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,980
carrying a company provided HTC One and

00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:28,890
eight that's running a build that I did

00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:31,020
myself of an older CyanogenMod with a

00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:33,510
number of interesting tweaks to change

00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,930
some of the security profile I was going

00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:38,940
to answer a red phone okay I've got a

00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,320
not yet X I think where's gray or

00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,530
someone who never seen my phone before

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:48,720
it's a parent to a good friend that

00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:50,940
works I'm using a samsung galaxy note 2

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,030
which runs replicants which is the

00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:56,340
flavor of android sponsored by the FSF

00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,470
which removes all the proprietary bits

00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:03,090
which means it's lacking some features

00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:06,360
like Wi-Fi and GPS and Bluetooth 3d

00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:09,120
graphics acceleration but I can tell you

00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:12,180
it makes phone calls sends receives text

00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:14,820
messages and fulfills my need as a phone

00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,920
everyday just fine so we're of course

00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,180
trying to fix those remaining obstacles

00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,890
and get the missing features implemented

00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,020
but in the meantime encourage people to

00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:24,710
give it a try the project is sponsored

00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:28,500
really as developed primarily just by

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:30,150
two main people and he's got the system

00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,760
working on several phones so imagine if

00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,200
two more people join him and did the

00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,730
necessary kernel work on those phones

00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,670
that we might actually have more

00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,510
features and more supported devices

00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,310
besides helping that project I think

00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,920
another good way forward because I also

00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:45,630
missed the 900 and the open moco in the

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,690
days when I was able to run a can your

00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:50,520
Linux system on my phone is I think we

00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:53,520
need to think about portable devices

00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:55,140
that are approximately phone size but

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,369
just to have working Wi-Fi with free

00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,500
software and then promote

00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:01,900
open Wi-Fi networks and mesh networking

00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,930
because no matter how free we get the

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,970
user space on any mobile phone the

00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:08,500
proprietary gsm firmware is gonna be an

00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,519
obstacle and attempts to replace that

00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,160
they're gonna run into big-time

00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,450
patents trouble so I think we need to

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,640
push on all fronts we should make them

00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:18,009
cause the patent trouble even we should

00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,839
also work on communications workarounds

00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:22,240
using what we have at our disposal yeah

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:24,160
even without the patent issues the

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,259
problem we have there is that the

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,119
hardware manufacturers can produce new

00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:30,519
devices faster than we can keep up with

00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:33,069
them and so to have to be able to

00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:35,019
actually go by a contemporary device you

00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:36,670
either have to just decide you're gonna

00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:38,470
live without a bunch of functionality or

00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,720
you have to decide that it's okay to run

00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:43,000
some sort of a hybrid software stack on

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:50,259
it we obviously are all sort of picking

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:51,970
different places on that continuum so I

00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:55,630
have variety devices a game through F

00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:57,819
from the n900 to the n9 also have an

00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,619
iPhone interesting we'd be important

00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:03,069
doing things like porting GStreamer to

00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:08,259
it so actually some of the stuff we do

00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:10,839
is replacing bits which are proprietary

00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:12,880
with free software and then the aim is

00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:15,700
to try and eventually lead towards the

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,220
place that we will eventually as as as

00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:20,259
John and I'm sure a lot of most people

00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,119
around this room is is we will live in a

00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:24,279
world where there is all entirely free

00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,980
software and we won't have to rely on on

00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:29,470
anything like that are we there yet

00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:33,519
nowhere near if you speak to any of the

00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:36,220
open hardware guys Vandy or detail in

00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:38,109
particular the level you get it's not

00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,349
very far before you reach something

00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:43,390
proprietary in hardware so it's

00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:45,430
somewhere that I think we would all like

00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:49,359
eventually to get to will we get there

00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:52,289
soon who knows I'm rubbish at predicting

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,289
the future in technology

00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:57,029
so embarrassing I have a moto X with

00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:58,709
stock Android on it and I've drawn my

00:40:57,029 --> 00:41:01,199
pragmatic lines with the phone should

00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:02,159
work but I will put in a plug for where

00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,140
I volunteer at the Free Software

00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:08,159
Foundation is in the respects your

00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:11,579
freedom program so what what hardware we

00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:13,380
use every day does matter but advocacy

00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:15,839
can make a much bigger difference in

00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,390
what hardware is like in the future and

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,179
really taking the steps to go in chalked

00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:25,649
Intel about how AMT is blocking having

00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:28,199
fully free laptops you can make a big

00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:30,299
difference over time I'll also say

00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:32,189
having worked on Ubuntu

00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:34,619
the first Ubuntu mobile and the

00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:37,499
beginnings of the Ubuntu phone it is not

00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,179
trivial to create interfaces that work

00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:42,719
well in mobile but it's entirely

00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:44,549
possible and I think Debian could

00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,919
attract a community of people who have

00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:48,569
the design skills and the technical

00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:52,409
expertise to do it we don't really have

00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:54,779
it right now but I think we could that's

00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:57,329
a great closing point does anyone want

00:41:54,779 --> 00:42:02,399
to another closing statement before we

00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:04,380
end in a minute I'll just reiterate what

00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:06,329
I said yesterday for the benefit of

00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,429
those who aren't in the room for the new

00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:10,439
people session um please if you have

00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:12,689
other questions particularly if you're

00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:15,839
new to the community or your student or

00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:17,909
whatever don't be it all afraid to come

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:19,979
and poke any of us anytime you see us

00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:22,409
during the week and ask a question or

00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:24,929
you know see if we're available to have

00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:26,399
a conversation because a large part of

00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:28,499
the reason many of us come here is

00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:30,689
precisely that to have the opportunity

00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:32,789
to meet new people talk to new folks

00:42:30,689 --> 00:42:35,249
about what we've been excited about for

00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:36,839
so long and help ensure that this

00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:39,169
community grows and flourishes in the

00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:39,169
future

00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:45,970
yes exactly I learned so much at DEFCON

00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:48,100
fits awesome well thank you very much

00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:50,020
for being on this panel and personally

00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:53,350
as a newbie thank you very much for the

00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,690
support and advice it's amazing thanks

00:42:53,350 --> 00:43:02,789
for helping us be here

00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:02,789
