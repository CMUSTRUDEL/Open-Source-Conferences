okay welcome to today's somewhat

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:13,080
foreshortened live demo session we've

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:15,150
got two entries the first is Thomas

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,570
Langer mystify okay

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,779
Thank You Metis so I want to show you

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,630
today the 5cd the the different things a

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,240
fine City can do first this is the web

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,210
page fine it's a fully automatic

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,059
installation and as you see you can just

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,149
download in either image there or if you

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,670
go to the five city submenu there are

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:49,559
several flavors yes

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:51,750
what zoom in Oh zoom in yeah okay so you

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:57,020
see there are different flavors of the

00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:00,480
CD and with five we can we can install

00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,359
ubuntu debian and other things what I

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,360
now do is I start a virtual machine whoo

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:12,060
and boot the CD and you will see a

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:16,619
simple grub mini and then we select the

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,110
client installation and it asks for a

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,350
user in the password but it's this is

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,590
only because it will wipe the whole disk

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,930
so after you enter the password install

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,009
you could not blame me to say oh my disk

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,780
was wiped so far is putting up and then

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,950
we have a nice menu where we can select

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,820
what we want to install my first phi

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,500
installation the first thing is just a

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,960
very simple debian system without any

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:53,340
graphical user interface you can select

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,189
the xfce or the gnome desktop you can

00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,030
also install sent to a seven or a boon

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:02,399
to on this CD we have all packages that

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,009
are needed for the xfce and the Gloam

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,310
installation so if we want to install

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,739
CentOS or Ubuntu it will need network

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,950
access to get the packages from the

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,890
network

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:18,700
but for gnome and Xfce we have all

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:22,690
packages on the ISO image we have a

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,959
short description at the bottom what

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,480
this will do a fancy xfce desktop and

00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:33,400
then and there will be an account

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,340
created then I just have to enter it and

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,900
say go on and then you see the normal

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:45,489
file installation first the the this

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:48,630
will be partitioned and then the

00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:51,519
packages will get installed and then I

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:55,120
do not have to do anything the rest is

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,799
just working fully automatically if I

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,769
also supports network based

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:02,799
installations and if you want setup the

00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:05,319
file server for the network installation

00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:08,319
you only have to use two commands for

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:11,920
creating this iso image so this is very

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,760
nice to have the same process for the

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,470
network installation for CD installation

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,630
you can use it for bare metal for

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,940
virtual machines for setting up change

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:25,230
food environments yeah it's always the

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:28,299
same process with the same features and

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,459
that's what I want to show you and it's

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:33,010
also very quick if you have a fast

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,819
machine and this virtual machine has its

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:39,790
disk in RAM so that will be very fast

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:45,340
maybe we are under 100 seconds to have

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,620
the xfce desktop installed yeah any

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:55,180
questions so far

00:03:46,620 --> 00:04:01,180
well this is running why do you call

00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:03,190
it's my first fence or not yeah I think

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,230
I will call it clout in it in the

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,049
Enterprise version where you have to buy

00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:11,760
licenses so but in the community version

00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:14,799
it's called my first fie installation

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,070
the is this using apartment for the

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,310
partition no FAI is not using the Debian

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:25,010
installer at all it can it uses the

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:28,490
preceding thing but what we use is

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:30,410
and fs routing so we made our change

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,960
with the environment this is the running

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:37,100
system during the installation and there

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,350
we wrote a script that reads some FS top

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,290
like configuration file and then

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,110
executes the part at commands so we are

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:48,140
not using the new depths from inside the

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,050
Debian installer we also have for

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:54,710
example battery FS support or LVM rate

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:57,350
so as you can see oh it took 150 seconds

00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:01,280
normally it's like 105 seconds

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,650
everything went fine I added a stop here

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,690
normally we could just say okay finished

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:11,380
reboot so one more typing return into

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,960
reboots goes back to the graph menu and

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:18,350
the the main entry is boot now from the

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:23,080
first partition of the disk and when we

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:27,680
do this we get the normal crap entry and

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:31,220
then the machine starts and you will see

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:37,820
the desktop I've created an account

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:39,880
called demo with the password FAI yeah

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,240
it's a demo

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,730
it's an unsecure demo and what I edit in

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,670
this configuration normally I do not

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,550
install by before by default but in

00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,950
this configuration I added the package

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,950
game so it was also installed and this

00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:00,290
and I could redo this also with the

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:04,340
gnome desktop and it would do the same

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:08,600
thing very fast and for me what's what's

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:10,760
very important that you can use Pfeiffer

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,770
for the different things so for bare

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,250
metal for the virtual machines the

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:19,160
change route CD or USB stick as I said

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:23,180
only two commands and you create the

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:26,030
bootable ISO we can also I've once

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,400
created a live CD so this is an

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,220
installation CD but you can also create

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,250
a live CD with five and currently I'm

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,710
working on the enterprise version and

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,600
that's really very easy because we have

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,210
everything in fie so

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,440
we can also create cloud images in maybe

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:49,760
in a week or two so that's it

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:51,260
another question yeah you mentioned the

00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,030
enterprise version can you elaborate on

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,800
pricing and licensing and stuff like

00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,800
that yeah it's it's very expensive

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:09,770
yeah a B or two so sort of this yeah

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:16,390
another question how hard is it to

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:16,390
customize yeah

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:26,180
the configuration files these are all

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:31,130
text files and they are divided in the

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:33,410
drift different in the different parts

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,990
of the installation so first we define

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,270
some classes we have like building

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,520
blocks in files so you can define a

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,970
class web server or department a

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,610
department B and then we have a

00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:50,660
subdirectory this config as I said

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:54,260
already the disk config file is is

00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,420
similar to an FS tap so we are where you

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,760
just described I want a primary or

00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:04,190
logical partition the size of the

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:06,470
petition you can define what what is

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,560
parsing this and turning it to a little

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:14,810
particle this is our own Perl script

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:17,810
that is padding this one yeah it's a it

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:21,670
should be very easy for the user so and

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:24,440
even the the LVM I think she is the LVM

00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,420
example if you once read an example I

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,850
think you could just write down your own

00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,740
configuration and for selecting the

00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,680
packages you just write the name of the

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,950
packages into an txt file that's it and

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,169
in the end the customization script we

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,539
use mostly shell scripts but you can

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,720
also use your puppet cfengine or

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:49,100
whatever configuration management script

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,070
that you are using or I used to in so

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:55,130
it's very flexible but yes the more

00:08:52,070 --> 00:09:01,810
partes to do the customization script if

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:04,579
you have very elaborated environments

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:09,440
okay that's it

00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:20,060
one more question No okay then up to the

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:22,130
next one thank you yeah so the actual

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,310
the main presenter for the next live

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:28,579
demo isn't he he's in Korea however his

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:33,139
glamorous assistant Bremner will be

00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:36,800
helping and you know standing in for his

00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:44,209
presence I'm trying to fill time while

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,690
he's setting up oh yeah you know within

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,660
reason

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,399
everybody should submit lightning talks

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,120
there is a session on Thursday there is

00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:56,060
another live demo session on Friday

00:09:52,120 --> 00:10:01,370
please send mail to is lightning real at

00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:05,029
Def Con org the address is also in the

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:11,660
announcement mails every day please -

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:14,360
I'd really like some Lightning talks you

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:18,040
know we just never ready the check and

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,040
it was different before but never mind

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:39,870
okay here we are you know you can yell

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:43,400
but really as soon as it stops breaking

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,400
you yeah sorry

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:53,370
remotely Sean written and locally david

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:55,500
remnar something something okay so um i

00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:00,810
guess some of you use emacs

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:03,420
i see i think anyway yeah you know who

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,570
you are so there's this thing called

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:09,090
melba which is sort of like the Wild

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:16,350
West but it has lots of useful packages

00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:19,020
in it 3192 packages it's sort of the

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,540
anti debian they always package from get

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:26,540
master they don't care about licenses a

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:32,400
lot of other blah so we wrote some tools

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:36,390
Sean and I to make it easy to confine my

00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,180
windows and bring these packages into

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:43,080
Debian after passing through a human in

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,590
the usual value-added way that makes

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,920
Debian worthwhile so sean is gonna walk

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:54,350
me through how to use the tool that he

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,760
wrote so by giving me things to type on

00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,530
IRC and I'm gonna bravely type them into

00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,940
my computer and this is going to be

00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:10,170
entertaining if not educational so

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:13,220
possibly go wrong I mean assuming Korea

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,220
is still on the Internet

00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:29,230
right well I don't think Sean's the

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:31,239
missile-launching type but okay what

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,589
could possibly go wrong I think somebody

00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:34,589
already said that so

00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:47,470
okay it's a little hard to see here let

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,430
me get rid of IRC and we'll bring Sean

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,079
back in a minute

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,660
oh I should split the window the other

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:58,329
way that would be smarter okay

00:12:52,660 --> 00:13:00,790
oh that's probably naazy inducing let me

00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:03,339
bring back the IRC all right so now we

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,910
have our see up above and my blind

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:09,910
following of Sean's commands down below

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:13,809
okay so I just cloned this repo from

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,660
github which is where most of this these

00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:20,019
projects live now Sean is in a minute

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:25,179
going to tell me to change into the

00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:28,119
directory that I just space and time

00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:40,959
it's a tiny whiny thing as dr. who would

00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:43,869
say I'm I'm done Sean the IRC has a lot

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,809
of like okay that's confusing

00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:53,769
I don't know how botnets manage this I

00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:55,749
can barely control one computer okay so

00:13:53,769 --> 00:14:01,410
we're just messing about a bit because

00:13:55,749 --> 00:14:01,410
this repo is slightly messed up

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:14,390
okay so so Shawn for whatever reason

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,430
wants me to make a master branch based

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:22,880
on the tag 4.0 and that this is his plan

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:26,950
for accomplishing that I mean there's

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,950
probably other ways to do the same thing

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:41,300
okay so great best light plants I told

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,560
you this was gonna be entertaining all

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,410
right so now he's answering your

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,690
question which luckily he's answering

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,250
the same way I did so so that we're not

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:56,600
contradicting each other that would be

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:58,010
embarrassing hey even sorrier okay so

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,490
I'm pretty sure I know what he's gonna

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,490
tell me next

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,100
okay so this is the interesting part so

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:16,310
we're gonna vote this tool who's used eh

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:20,870
make pearl one Nico thanks okay Walter

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:24,320
thank you thank you okay so this is if

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,350
you think pearl and Emacs are both scary

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,600
horrible things this is the tool for you

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:32,540
because it's a repurposing of the pearl

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,340
tool to package Emax things so I mean

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,930
Shaun did a bunch of work but he started

00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:42,850
with th make pearls so alright so

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:47,480
probably easier so and it has an option

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:50,900
which says use the options most suitable

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,070
for the for the Emacs team don't see now

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,510
he's getting head of me I'm talking too

00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,580
much

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:58,550
alright so that didn't give too much

00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:01,220
output itself to say dude you're a

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:05,420
Debian maintainer you should actually

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,770
look at the output of this tool alright

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,350
we're gonna have to pick up the pace

00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,350
here less comedy more action

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:23,950
okay so I just committed the blindly

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:35,200
committed the output of the tool which

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:36,990
is of course a terrible idea yeah okay I

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:46,660
hope we don't run out of time here

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:51,790
cuz he has this whole quilt idea well

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:55,780
the tension is killing me here I'm

00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:59,340
tempted to cheat alright so the point is

00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:10,110
is that upstream screwed up as upstream

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:17,350
does okay so he says edit edit by hand

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:25,240
what using what an editor oh yeah I

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:31,090
forgot that Emacs does that uh where

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:33,610
though I could use said from within

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:37,660
Emacs yeah that'll be funny all right is

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:41,560
there any other so there's sounds like

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:44,820
just the one but let's be sure I missed

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,820
the important one of course

00:17:51,820 --> 00:18:07,690
upstream you're making me look bad

00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:07,690
okay yes okay so I I think I got it

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,740
not yet that's a good point

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:37,620
okay so then where's my show all right

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:42,860
so what was my this is problem the

00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:53,130
package source packets source - - commit

00:18:42,860 --> 00:19:00,990
MIT I have no tarball help me out here

00:18:53,130 --> 00:19:14,990
guys what maybe I can just build it

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:18,720
anyway okay so that more or less worked

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:20,640
and the thing that Sean wanted me to

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,620
point out is that we've build

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,040
infrastructure to make sure it runs the

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,020
test suite so yay running test suites

00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,840
and this is so if you use these tools

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,610
it's always run it build at running the

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:41,070
upstream test suite or it does its best

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:43,050
anyway so we built a package and I'm not

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:47,250
going to type s you do inside d-max

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:49,400
sorry there's only so much trust in the

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,400
world

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:04,270
so I'm installing the the package that I

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:08,350
just made if I can remember my root

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:16,180
password so all of you shoulder surfing

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:28,870
on me stream help me out okay so um can

00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:30,790
I have 30 seconds right so so one of the

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,530
things about the packaging tools is that

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:36,940
you don't have to edit your dog Emacs or

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:39,280
anything so now I can if I could

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:42,130
remember the command let's go back to

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,940
the other screen what am i running help

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:58,080
oh yeah right

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:58,080
Thanks avy go to character character l

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,580
okay so I don't actually know how to use

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:08,080
this package but you can see that it was

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:10,330
doing something right so all right we

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,730
went from git clone to running the

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,860
package in ten minutes and I could show

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:35,500
you the packaging is not too awful so

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:37,410
I'll stop on IRC from Sean don't ask me

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,620
anything hard

00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:44,140
okay sorry comment to the speaker I

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:47,230
think that must be for Thomas I don't

00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:52,460
even know what a desktop background ears

00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:56,840
any offices sure it's possible to change

00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:59,810
the desktop background but I think I

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,970
don't know how to change it because I do

00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:05,030
not use a desktop on my machine

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:08,060
I guess there's some gnome config

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:10,610
command that you have to execute and

00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,460
then give it the the new image that it

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,590
will put on it and but normally you

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:18,620
would do this command inside the

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:21,260
customization script of five so if you

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,780
know how to change the background in

00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,820
gnome you can put this command in the

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,850
script and it will be executed during

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,350
the installation but please ask the

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,830
gnome people how to change the

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,830
background

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,780
in summary can you just summarize what

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,980
you've done

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:57,130
sure and how you got from the git

00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:02,860
repository to the sure

00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:06,060
so the first step actually which was

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:09,520
invisible was we wrote some debhelper

00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:16,780
extensions so there's an extension

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:19,960
called D H alpha which basically does

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:23,220
all the build time stuff that we need to

00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,820
make it easy to package Emacs packages

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:32,020
yes so that's in in testing by now and

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:36,100
we'll be back ported soon the tool that

00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:39,670
I demonstrated today generates a

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:42,700
skeleton debian package that uses uses

00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:45,100
this helper tool I don't want to

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,550
minimize that but both both pieces are

00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,550
important

00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:02,620
thank you very much reminder to those

00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:05,780
just tuning in now live demos Friday

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,790

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,900
available ten minutes each
