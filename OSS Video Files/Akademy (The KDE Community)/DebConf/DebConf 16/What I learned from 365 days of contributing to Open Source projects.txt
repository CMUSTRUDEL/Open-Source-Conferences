my name is leta every Anson's I'm no

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,330
pass or developer have been part of that

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,580
PHP madman development team for a few

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,219
years and I'm working on some other

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,800
projects I will talk about my experience

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,430
of committing to an open-source project

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:25,650
or per source projects for 365 days in a

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:29,910
row so first of all I'll tell something

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:32,820
about myself I really like statistics so

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,590
the chart you see in the bottom is a

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,590
project I'm working on now to visualize

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,870
what's going on in the build process

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,320
like jet-like Travis the thing in the

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:51,149
top is something about the language

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:55,050
different languages you I commit YouTube

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:59,219
and solid per language or operating like

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:02,520
a programming language but the thing

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,270
this talk is mostly about is about the

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:11,460
number of commits I did on github so

00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:13,530
let's get started but I returned from a

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,330
holiday without taking any any laptop

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:24,509
just just relaxing not thinking about if

00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:27,659
about developing or doing anything I had

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,549
done commits tricks before so when I

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,140
returned I just wanted to want to do the

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,820
same thing and I didn't really make a

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,070
plan I just thought well I will get

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:41,340
started and see how far see how far hold

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:45,659
it so just to make sure what what is all

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,790
about this means committing to I to make

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,700
making at least one commit to an

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,700
open-source project that's hosted on on

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,090
github in public repos so the private

00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:02,850
repos don't counts any any type of

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:05,149
contribution so reading from both commit

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,149
to

00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,380
okay

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,950
and I'm doing this in my email free time

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,230
so during my day job I don't work an

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,660
open source so in evenings and during

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:27,600
weekends and during holidays I'm writing

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,950
software so if you want to do this if

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,430
you have to do a long streak and commit

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:36,960
every day you need a bit of a plan you

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:41,910
need to be able to do commit every day

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,500
so muscle loss is basically these events

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,030
all the time you have if you have

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,870
internet or not and the kind of

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,520
infrastructure that is I mean are you

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,890
working at home if your full development

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,670
sets or are you on the roads and you

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,440
just have a just a few smartphone or a

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:03,000
small laptop with no internet

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,850
connectivity so typically when you have

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,390
a lot of time we get that we get a free

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,800
afternoon at home if your your PC at

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,030
home you have plenty of time so you can

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,489
work on on bigger things like

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:20,400
implementing a new feature or trying to

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,800
figure out why by something doesn't work

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,310
and try to fix it or work on a bigger

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,600
probe projects a bigger feature try to

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,810
split it in two I'll do some invasive

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:35,480
investigation try to split it in smaller

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,480
tasks that you can work on later on I

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:42,390
found out that if you're traveling you

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,580
spend multiple hours on a plane or on a

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,040
train you can do some stuff as well

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:51,049
yes plenty of time you can't go anywhere

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,519
but usually you don't have internet so

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:56,060
I've done quite a bit of refactoring

00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,239
that during those during those times and

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:02,580
it's also great great time to improve

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,110
your unit tests I just write unit tests

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:11,670
I don't need internet to do this

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:15,750
so another typical typical one is a busy

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:23,220
day so you get home from work you have

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:24,510
something if you have limited time you

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,300
have something planned for the evening

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:33,630
so you just want to get something quick

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:35,760
done like fixing some coding style doing

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:40,080
a translation doing a translation you

00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,990
can also do i've using just using your

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,960
smartphone using a rapid web based

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,600
translations of some projects I also

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,620
kept a list of small tasks that I knew

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,140
that take much much time I for

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,890
emergencies like what all gets to that's

00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:01,260
in a moment I also notice that that's if

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:05,160
you take some time to fix coding style

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,690
and improve code quality and write more

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:13,770
tests that your code quality actually

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:16,190
improves because so I kept going on was

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:21,510
at WonderCon sixty-two days when I

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:25,740
talked to a guy called Josh who pledged

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:30,930
to do a 360 to do to do a commits every

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:34,020
every every day for 365 days in a row to

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,410
an open source project his idea was to

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:42,390
if you do a commit every day then it

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:44,790
will surely advance open source at that

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:50,060
time okay why not let's try it let's see

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:52,740
how far I can get but until until then I

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,280
had just been working on open source

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,729
during between holidays so when I went

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:05,570
on holiday I didn't really stop

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:05,570
contribute contributing contributing so

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:14,870
they're not to think about in the summer

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:26,229
I I went I went on holiday so had to

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:26,229
plan - so what do

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:38,030
so I went on holiday and I needed I took

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:41,990
my laptop just to continue my streak so

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:44,600
I was a climate take so during the day

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,970
was I was a busy climbing rock and in

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,550
the evening we saw socializing you see

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,870
by campfire talk to some people have

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,050
dinner

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:57,590
so had some small small commits some

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,180
small tasks set up for that week I must

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,970
say it has been a close call in a few

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:07,100
days was one day I was ill another day I

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:08,270
almost forgot to do my commit and it was

00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,780
another day I had a technical problem

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:16,160
where I couldn't figure out how to get

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,930
it to get something to work so I at some

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,180
point was five to midnight before I

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:23,710
before I made my night commit for that

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,240
day so but in the end I succeeded I

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:30,550
returned from my hole from a holiday and

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,200
I still had my streak going so

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,620
experience some difficulties visit the

00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,270
at work already mentioned I had a hard

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,550
day at work at home you don't want to

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,410
think about program but writing software

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,120
you just want to relax and do do

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,300
something else

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,830
so that's right then you just have to do

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,810
that one commit just took a little

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,560
request to get your streak going

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,510
sometimes you have other things planned

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,210
an evening you go straight from work to

00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,280
dinner and go watch a film or something

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:07,039
then you have to have something lined up

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,599
as well - I do that day sometimes you

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,639
get stuck on a problem you're working on

00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,139
you start working on problem and it

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,020
turns out that the API you're working

00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:17,300
with it's not doing what you expect and

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,370
then at some point you need to get your

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,860
sleep and you still haven't committed so

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,470
you have to find something to do that

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,030
day as well also find out found out that

00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,220
you have to commit to a master branch of

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,940
a project so if you're working on a

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,260
feature branch then that commit doesn't

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,770
count until it's merged into master

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,959
branch so if you're sure that it will

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,900
get into master it's not a big problem

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,580
to

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,410
to merge Italy the round that's if

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,230
you're not sure that will happen and you

00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:50,700
have to take that in account we when you

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:52,230
commit traveling is it can be a bit of a

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,400
problem as well I just mentioned my

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:58,320
climbing trip sometimes it's hard to

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,790
take a laptop or there's no connectivity

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,370
or and related to that is time zones so

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,690
if you're traveling if you stay in the

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,270
same time zone there's no real problem

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,090
because the day is still the day but if

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,470
you go to another time zone you have to

00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:16,170
either switch your laptop to the that

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:20,970
time zone and then I remember I try to

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:22,590
remember that you will not not miss a

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,140
day because because of the time

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,880
difference or if you keep your laptop in

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,710
the same time zone but then you have to

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,050
remember what time your what time of day

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:36,870
it is at at home so that you you commit

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:40,590
in time so it was one time I was in

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:44,130
California and we had went for dinner in

00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:46,080
the evening and then at a time until

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,510
nine o'clock anymore in the evening I

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,880
guess to do my commit so I had to rush

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:55,530
rush back to my hotel to do my final

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:58,410
commit for daddy so there are some some

00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:01,740
things that saved my streak I already

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,840
mentioned the easy tasks task list I was

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,900
doing some translation for a for a

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:11,580
project of a friend of mine that I could

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:14,010
regularly do some work on and add some

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,990
some small issues that that were easy to

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,370
fix

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:24,360
so commit time and push time is not the

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:27,480
same thing so I spent some weekends in

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,090
in the forest in France but no internet

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,070
connectivity so I did my commits while I

00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,500
was there and when I got home I pushed

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,240
them so the the time that I committed

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,200
them counted another time when I pushed

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,870
it to internet to push it to the repo

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,870
also found out I the thing I did when I

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,310
was in a week we can't influence to do

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,230
two commits

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,750
just before and just after midnight to

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,930
put it there it took me 20 minutes

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:58,350
to do to do two commits and that covered

00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,990
48 hours was I could carry on for the

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:04,230
rest of the weekend and then issues and

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:08,730
pull requests counts as a as a

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:13,770
contribution in Inc it in a github so I

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:16,740
tried not not to rule to tutor stone

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:22,520
them too much but I think maybe one or

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:28,020
two days of my 265 were actually just an

00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:30,650
initial early as she reported so let's

00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:35,030
talk about cheating it's easy to cheat

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:37,950
so you can just create a bogus commit I

00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:41,160
open the text file put some put some

00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:43,290
gibberish in it you can even automate

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,380
this you can create a script that just

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:49,380
that just creates create that file for

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,240
you even side you can change the commute

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,600
time of your commit so you can saw a guy

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,980
who created the script to make commits

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,900
four thousand days in a row and just

00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,460
pushed it and chose that on get up and

00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,589
the other two thousand a commits tweak

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,870
and it didn't sigh probably spent half

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:06,089
an hour making it script or something so

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,610
that makes you wonder about the value of

00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:15,900
a streak I you can easily cheat you can

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:19,589
easily easily faked it so you probably

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:21,480
ask did I cheat well maybe I I didn't

00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:23,580
really I didn't cheat in that we didn't

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,040
use these these these techniques I just

00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:30,330
mentioned that I sometimes used issued a

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:32,400
pull request or or filed an issue to

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:38,120
have to have my commitment for that day

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:43,020
but I didn't go further than that so

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,720
amazing Josh was a mentioned who we

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:49,170
started the idea of having a year-long

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,460
commit streak I've got to meet him when

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:56,640
I was in California and he told me that

00:12:52,460 --> 00:13:00,500
what he started his committee started

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,120
doing his commits every day for six days

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,640
6866 days in a row and then he went to

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,440
Burning Man

00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,120
and on day one of birding - yeah I

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,290
didn't really feel like I was the

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,360
atmosphere of Burning Man

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:17,940
so it didn't really feel like continuing

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,430
his streak while he was there and when

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:24,839
he got back why I didn't really want to

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:30,120
continue so well for him it didn't work

00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,860
doing doing a commit everyday so I took

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,420
talked to some other people as I read

00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,570
some blogs about by other people who

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:40,110
were have been doing a considerable

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,790
considerable streak and most of the

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,570
people said they were relieved it was

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:50,580
over so some of them most of them ended

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:52,770
by accident so they forgot to commit and

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,260
then the number that the the street

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:58,860
number was at zero so why it happened

00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:02,220
and they didn't just you're glad that it

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:06,839
was over and so that started me thinking

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:10,110
when so it feels like kind of a burden I

00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:14,550
have to continue and and do it every day

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:16,950
and get get X it yourself I some days it

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,930
goes easy other days you don't feel

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:23,209
really feel like it so what sort of a

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:27,270
thing even is this a good thing to do so

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:31,200
in the end I pushed on and I reach my

00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:34,380
300 to 65 65 they commit streak actually

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:42,570
I went on until my next holiday so I

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:45,870
reached 452 days so let's get to what I

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:50,190
learned from it so one commit leads to

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:54,930
another so even a small commit like fix

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:58,080
fixing a small type or or doing some

00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,550
some code quality changes it's you

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,150
notice stuff you notice something you

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,130
see that as a comment is wrong or you

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,709
see that some function can be can be

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,660
refactored so by just looking at your

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:12,620
new small change looking at your code

00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:15,360
you see that things can be improved so

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,709
the next committee comes easily actually

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,829
and doing one committed day

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,449
creates a habit so not to offer two or

00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:24,850
three days but the mode you get two

00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:27,129
seven eight seven or eight days then

00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,290
yeah you want to get on you want to want

00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:30,790
to get the you want get you want to get

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,839
to thirty days you want to get to ninety

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:36,160
days and at some point you want you're

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,949
afraid to break the streak

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,809
you just want to go on and you just keep

00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:42,879
in mind on okay if I stop today then

00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,769
left have to spend two months ago two

00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:52,959
months again to get to the same level

00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:55,139
but also contributing to a project you

00:15:52,959 --> 00:16:03,459
should do it because you like it

00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:06,069
so if you just try to follow the metric

00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:09,189
I'll let you keep that key that number

00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:13,860
going then you're not going to do you

00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:13,860
not go to succeed and then then I

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,819
noticed a similar thing in Trinity

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,519
sports when you do it when you do some

00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:27,009
running it's nice to track your progress

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,839
just to see how you're improving but if

00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:30,970
you start to live for the numbers and

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,339
you always want to improve and run

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,519
faster and run longer then at some

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:39,279
points you will get injuries because in

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,769
Ewell's you'll just focus on only

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,749
improvement not not on the on the joy

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:46,389
you had for doing for doing the activity

00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:48,819
so it is it's a similar thing with which

00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:50,740
with writing software compute

00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:53,589
contributing to a universe or

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:57,069
open-source project used to you should

00:16:53,589 --> 00:17:03,040
do it because you like it and not just

00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:06,140
to get that number so will not do it

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,589
again I guess not

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,059
well it doesn't say that that I didn't

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:15,980
it was an interesting experience it was

00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:18,970
interesting to see how we have to cope

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,740
mentally with with getting yourself

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,490
committed every day at the bad days

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:28,940
where it was hard to to find a committee

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:31,880
to do that day but in general I enjoyed

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,830
my drug enjoyed my projects I made some

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,110
huge progress in the things I was

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:41,330
working on so it was a good thing to do

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:43,490
have to keep doing it for our four-year

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,820
long two to two rights no that's up to

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:50,750
you but maybe one year of committing is

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:53,240
a is a maybe bit too long maybe do it

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,980
within shorter stretches but the most

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,840
important thing I find is that you

00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,690
should find the balance between doing

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,650
the work and taking breaks so taking

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:07,040
taking breaks here is a is important too

00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:10,340
I read a blog about one guy we

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,740
recommended that the streaks have her

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,140
get up it's not a good thing so we were

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,780
just in just during the weeks and in the

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,320
weekends it doesn't do anything I just

00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:24,440
relax and enjoy his time with his family

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,830
so I recommend just take regular breaks

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,200
because you will enjoy writing software

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:31,549
and it would be a pity if you get a burn

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:37,250
out just because you keep pushing that

00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:39,860
that metric so things I do to unwind is

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,770
just going to nature to go walk or go on

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,419
holiday climb a bit so that's something

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:47,090
you should do as well or do something

00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:49,400
enjoyable so I'd like to thank the

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:54,710
people I got some inspiration from from

00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:57,370
and that was the life to say so we have

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,370
you have questions

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,650
would you say there have been cases

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,360
where you would delay a commit or right

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,460
occur but not committed yet so that you

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,360
would have your next day commit more

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:28,470
easily I thought about it but I never

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:35,040
did it I what I did but I did do so at

00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:38,070
some point was I provided a research

00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:41,100
before so I when I was going to write a

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,200
function or implement something I found

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,260
I tried to figure out how to do it and

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,490
then write write the codes I did it

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,070
right in the code on the day were

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:59,880
actually bitter committed but I did some

00:19:50,070 --> 00:20:02,160
preparation in only 400 some cases how

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,040
many different projects we contribution

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,780
to was that one primarily in the couple

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,030
of commits to some matters or was it

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,990
spread out among a bunch of projects I

00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:16,230
think it was about five or six so I was

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:19,020
still doing a bit for PHP much at that

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,480
time I was working on the on Android app

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,460
and I started the new projects in the

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,260
same period I was doing some translation

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,970
work for another project and there are

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:32,310
some small thing small projects I did

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,670
fix a small block 4 or fix it up or

00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,670
something

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,269
hi do you think that the quality of the

00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,250
code that you write has been affected

00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:46,860
while trying to maintain a commit streak

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,629
if it has improved or degraded in

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,090
quality just because you are trying to

00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:55,559
maintain a streak well I think it has

00:20:51,090 --> 00:21:00,269
improved was that some days it was

00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:03,600
easier I had some statistics running on

00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:05,700
code quality so on some days we had just

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,220
a little little time I went through that

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:13,440
list of problems that had tried to fix

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:16,080
fix those so also when when I was on a

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,220
longer trip races going on going on a

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:23,990
picnic going on a plane or or entrain

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:29,220
for a few hours had time to actually

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:31,769
improve some tests and so if I wouldn't

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,019
have done that then I probably would

00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:37,909
never have gotten to the to be proving

00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:41,240
those to improving the code quality

00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:41,240
other questions

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,750
all right so I just have a final

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,600
question um what advice do you have for

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,480
people starting contributing to open

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,130
source I let's say students or someone

00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:00,790
who has in contribute to open source at

00:21:54,130 --> 00:22:03,210
all how do they get started that's a

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:06,910
good question

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:10,780
blog is what most people I guess most

00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:16,180
people starts at least I did put ribbon

00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:19,540
into open source is by discovering a

00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:22,300
backing in software they are using and

00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,850
you notice something or you like if you

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,110
like a piece of software and then you

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,690
think eh maybe this feature would be

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,850
nice or this bug this this thing bothers

00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:34,450
me and then you're getting contact with

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:38,380
I get into contact with the community of

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,630
that project and then you found out how

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,540
they work and then that that's that's

00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:46,750
how that's at least how I rolled into it

00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,520
just by liking a piece of software and

00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,940
wanted to contribute to make it better

00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,140
and then for the community I contact

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,900
community and they will they will a

00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:59,620
gradual on what's the best way to start

00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:04,360
contributing contributing Albertans ask

00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:06,810
