	00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,980
right good afternoon I'm going to try

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,650
and turn this into discussion as much as

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,880
I can because you can hear my throat is

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,369
suffering already i'm jonathan i am one

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,840
of four of the debian account managers

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,789
and when i asked who was doing this out

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,930
of the four of us a few days ago the

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,529
answer was well you're the only one

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,320
there so have fun so here we are so what

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,450
I'm going to recap very quickly for

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,190
people who aren't involved in this

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,800
process at all who's who and who ends up

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,020
in which bits of the process and then

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,250
there is some news that we have if

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,500
you're already involved in the process

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,670
because Enrico has had a burst of

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,489
activity recently and rewritten

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,340
everything under the world and then we

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,079
can never discuss anything that anybody

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,430
wants to bring up or that I managed to

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,920
pick on people to talk about so so who

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,900
is completely new to this isn't involved

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:12,240
at all give me a wave completely new

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:15,470
that you don't count okay so it's so few

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,700
so so so who's in the process we have

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,680
several teams in several different

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:26,250
groups of people who take a part in this

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:28,590
so the account managers and then there

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,030
are also front desk involved in doing

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,159
the administrative work to make all the

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,250
things make all the wheels go round we

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:40,110
have here is a suit here from keyring

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,189
Johnson and gonna is anybody here from

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,790
front desk I can't remember if I'm

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:46,110
always expecting anyone know so keyring

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,360
maintainer

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:53,000
put the keys in and applique ring as we

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,000
as we need them to and then we have

00:01:53,090 --> 00:02:01,560
Debian maintainer x' are you here any

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:08,190
debian maintain is not developers just

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:09,539
maintain as one yes okay one or two if

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,300
you're unfamiliar with the term the

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,709
Debian maintainer is has limited upload

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,040
rights on some packages

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,329
so they're not of Debian member as in

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,209
the formal sense there's no voting

00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:26,670
rights or or or archive wide access but

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,709
you can have limited rights and the

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,120
intention is that you can get used to

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,980
doing some uploads with some packages

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,370
build up some history and then perhaps

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,579
become a DD later on and we have Debian

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:45,329
developers who are full members and they

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:47,040
can be uploading but for some years now

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:48,389
we have also have non uploading

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,220
developers the only difference is that

00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:51,810
uploading developers can upload things

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,060
and non-voting developers cannot upload

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,569
things it's it is as straightforward as

00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,299
that so a DD nu as we call them has all

00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,010
the voting and delegation and rights and

00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:07,200
so on that are not loading developer

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:11,489
does so do we have non uploading

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:15,299
developers at all handy and uploading

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:22,650
the Ripper's and if I haven't caught you

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:27,859
yet who did I miss out okay I'm not as

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,859
ill as I thought sorry

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,980
application managers are Debian

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:40,340
developers who have some experience in

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,340
the project and who take an applicant

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,140
and guide them through the new

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,459
maintenance process and decide whether

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,870
they think that they were going to

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,340
recommend them to become a devoted in

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,500
developer and then report back to the

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,069
account managers and then finally we

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,299
have contributors who is everybody else

00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,040
who's not involved because if you're

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,690
contributing to develop Debian you are

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,160
by de facto a Debian contributor so we

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,900
would normally expect that you're a

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,489
contributor for a little while and then

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,989
you're and then when you decide you want

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,280
to join the project formally you're an

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,280
applicant for a little while and you

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,859
might go on to become one of the one of

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,090
the three categories of member that we

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:23,639
have if you have been a Debian developer

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,250
for a little while then either you will

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,300
volunteer or I might hunt you down and

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,650
say you want to be an application

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,780
manager don't you because I have a queue

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,430
and I always have a queue so if you are

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,020
sat in here and you're a DD and you have

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,430
been for more than about three days and

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,620
you'd like to be an application manager

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:41,630
please come and talk to me because there

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,630
is a queue as there always is

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:54,660
all of these processes are now handled

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:59,040
by the nm Debian org database and

00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,560
website that goes with it so Debbie and

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,030
maintainer x' has for some years has

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,130
been handled by Annabelle almost

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,470
exclusively but it's always been a

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,790
long-term goal to follow that into the

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,900
rest of the processes and that's now

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:14,730
complete so if you have if you are used

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,370
to the nm website you'll find that there

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,020
are new style processes and the old

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,400
style ones that are in progress will be

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,040
completed but then they'll be archived

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,200
new start processes take lots of the

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,600
work out for you because you don't need

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,400
to do the SC and Deema agreement anymore

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,200
you don't need to get a declaration of

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,700
intent from your applicant you don't

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,660
need to get their login name and you

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,250
don't need to get their forwarding

00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,780
address and you don't need to make sure

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,310
they've got the biography because the

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,910
website will enforce all of this before

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,500
they even reach you so so if you're an

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,880
AM or if you're thinking about being an

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,940
AM but think that sounds like an awful

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,020
lot of guesswork we took it all away

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,170
it's fine you'd have to do anything

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,170
anymore

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,340
new style processes are much quicker to

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,380
take place in the few that we've that

00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,940
we've been doing because the

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,670
administrative work is already out of

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,500
the way so as an application manager

00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,620
what I'm looking for when you when you

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,920
recommend or or don't an applicant is

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,170
that you can find sufficient evidence in

00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,720
the archive or in there or in their

00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,430
social work that they're doing good work

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,650
and they're doing it consistently and

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,300
they are a good social fit and if all

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,510
those boxes are true then there's very

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,620
little you need to you need to you

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,030
should find that you're needing to

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,570
discuss with them you should be able to

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:32,100
find most of that activity already if if

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,420
there isn't evidence like that in the

00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,130
archive that's probably an indication

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,850
that they're not ready to be a full

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,800
developer yet they're so new pro new

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,600
start prices a lot are lovely and if ng

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,010
and if you're applying in the future you

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,690
will be on a new style process there's

00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:49,290
only a handful of evolved ones still

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:51,240
left to run there is one exception to

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:56,870
this which is collab mate access which

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,220
is still a manual process because it

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:03,330
automating it probably involves screen

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,610
scraping fusion Forge and and nobody's

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,800
really felt very enthusiastic about that

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,890
to date and it's probably dangerous as

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,510
well so we are still handling collabing

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:17,640
requests by hand signed mail to front

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,090
desk I am a W maintainer mode to get to

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,820
collaborate or I am a DJ no sorry Aditi

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,350
has collaborated already or I am working

00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,020
with this person and I'd like them to

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,380
have collab mayn't access and it'll be

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,380
turned around

00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,790
if you're feeling enthusiastic we could

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,430
do with some help with documenting all

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:46,350
this because documentation is not a

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:48,210
strong point so updating some of the

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,669
wiki pages which talk about old

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,650
processes and talk about mailing front

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:55,260
desk for lots of things and so on need

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,840
tidying up documentation on the main

00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,790
website could do with harmonizing so

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,990
that there are there are places where we

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,650
talk about three or four ways of doing

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,180
things and if you were an application

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,410
manager at the moment we could do with

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,050
more people on front desk because

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,030
there's a there's a natural graduation

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,400
from front desk to account manager but

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,910
then we don't really have many people

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,100
coming through at the the other end of

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,390
that chain front desk is quite

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,540
interesting you'll meet lots of you'll

00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:26,010
meet many of the applicants who are

00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,570
coming through and you'll also get to

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,280
know the developers who are working as

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,660
as AM quite well

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,700
so it's an interesting it's an

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,659
interesting job that you do not need to

00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,550
make judgment decisions about applicants

00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,830
it's purely administrative so you don't

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:44,810
need to worry about having to have

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:47,280
difficult conversations with people and

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,760
at the end of the process you check that

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,470
all of the applicants details are right

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,570
and that their applications ready to be

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,880
to be reviewed and and and that's about

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,410
all so if you fancy be in a front desk

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,560
remember please come and have a word

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,120
with me and if you're a developer and

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,560
you think that you might like to be an

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,110
application manager you're also very

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,520
welcome to come and talk to me I could

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,510
probably do with one on

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:17,190
- who are prepared to do non uploading

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,810
applications which are because they're

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,450
less technical it's less easy to get a

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,160
ground on what somebody's up to so you

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,060
get to know the applicant a little bit

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:31,590
better with those and we could always do

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,120
with new uploading AMS as well you don't

00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,680
necessarily need to be exclusive to one

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:42,540
or the other I can feed you whichever

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:48,300
you fancy doing next so if you're in the

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:49,920
process now how are you finding it or

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:55,080
perhaps I should rephrase that who's in

00:09:49,920 --> 00:10:08,940
the process now one how are you finding

00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:11,640
it I'm still in the old process yeah I I

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:16,730
hope for the new process because the old

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:20,280
one was a bit complicated and yeah such

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:22,200
too much things around I would have

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,770
preferred to be in the new process of

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,230
venom but it works how long have you

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,580
been in your process

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:35,790
I applied officially in February okay

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,840
activate a few months for my advocacies

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:46,490
and now they are just sorting out the

00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:48,930
rest good February to June or July

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,790
getting your advocacies and getting into

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,130
an application manager is is probably

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:56,790
about the kind of queue were at at the

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:59,820
moment what I'm hoping and when would

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,830
like very much is that we can speed up

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,540
the next part of that which is working

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,110
with your application manager and the

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,390
making a recommendation yes

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,490
I've completed the new process two weeks

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:15,320
ago going took seven days and it was

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,320
awesome that's much more line

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:29,310
Tania I'm in their own process and

00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:32,730
husband eight months so alright like I'm

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,920
on the old process and has been eight

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:40,740
months can I like start again with a new

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:44,880
one you might as well finish honey hurry

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,709
hit but um so to be clear the the the

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,560
new star process gets lots of the

00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:50,820
administration more streamlined but the

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,240
time you spend on your application

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,639
manager will will still depend on how

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,690
much your involvement is already and how

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,300
much time you have and they have ideally

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:06,949
in a matter of weeks is good for that

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:11,459
stage eight months did you say he's

00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:13,889
getting on a bit so let me know about

00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:15,240
the process and let's get some movement

00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:16,320
on it because we can probably if it's

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,730
been that long already we can probably

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,750
just get some boxes ticked again you

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,870
finish for the old timers can you

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,779
explain how the new process makes is so

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,850
much faster yeah what what's what's the

00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,480
magic behind the new process that makes

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,480
it so fast

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:51,530
so I'm going to borrow I'm going to

00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,660
borrow high-voltage for this I'm

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,450
sure you won't mind and so here is the

00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:00,140
details that we need to collect for him

00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:02,090
in the advocacy's okay block sorry in

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,160
the requirements okay block at the

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:07,130
beginning there or of course all not

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,470
okay and so the reason this is quicker

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,000
for the application manager is that lots

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,670
of this can be done by the applicant

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,680
themselves so the key consistency checks

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,790
for example are done by the site as soon

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,250
as you apply and you're giving your key

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,110
fingerprint and it says yes or no so you

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,880
don't need to run key checked or SH

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,910
anymore you don't need to check these

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:35,420
signatures on it because you can see it

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:38,450
all straight there the advocacies matter

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:41,420
less as the a.m. but as a front desk

00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,730
what we were doing is keeping an eye out

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,380
for the advocacies and as they arrive we

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,000
mark them okay and then they move on to

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:52,250
the next step of the process and again

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,230
these are automatic so as an advocate or

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,910
an applicant you don't generate mails

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,460
and sign them anymore you feed all the

00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:01,700
data straight into the nm site which

00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,730
makes it much more streamlined the deem

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,040
of agreements similarly use you the

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,330
applicant will be prompted for the text

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,630
that needs to be written for the nema

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:14,030
and they sign it and feed into the site

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,010
and the site checks the signature so all

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,690
of that administrivia happens before

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,370
your applicant even gets assigned to you

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,550
so you can chop that whole section out

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,310
of the house of the template you can ask

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,480
them again if you if you're feeling like

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,900
you need to spend a bit more time with

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,900
them but

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:46,760
so application managers how are you

00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:51,800
getting horn have who's here let's start

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:55,340
with that okay we for keep your hand up

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,000
if you heard from your applicant in the

00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,230
last three months

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,190
keep your hand up if you heard from your

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,190
applicant in the last six weeks

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:13,880
no kicking them in person does not count

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:18,910
because I can't see it

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,910
did you hear from the last week okay

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:30,830
okay okay I've timed this really badly

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,620
that's quite good I'm pleased about that

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,990
because because the process has a

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,020
reputation of being torturous for

00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:41,450
application managers and applicants and

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,850
we're gradually shedding that reputation

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,560
but I still I still see places where

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,970
people say oh no I'm not in the process

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,320
because I've heard it's terrible it

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,400
takes three years and then I get nothing

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,800
out of it in the end anyway

00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,120
so if it may say something on that

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,040
because I keep oh I have heard that

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,750
before I applied to become a diamond

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,140
developer which is something like ten

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:05,480
years ago and actually a little depends

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,330
a lot on Balcer application major and

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,650
applicant I've had an applicant who

00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:14,330
finished all styles as was in C days

00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,520
which means I got five two males per day

00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,450
from him with your answers yes it's

00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,030
possible

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:22,790
it depends on both sides so if one of

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,700
the sites starts not direct feedback but

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:28,700
late slave may wait for whatever for two

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,290
days two weeks two months you're dead so

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,150
that's a very important thing if both

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,600
sides in the keep taking you to could go

00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,610
fast with the old style but of course as

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,290
always you get the bad news not from the

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,870
one who is working fine but from the

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,760
other ones so it would be nice if it

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,100
could get rid of it saying it's it's

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,050
slow but I'm not convinced to the live

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,030
works by change the process but we need

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,160
to tell the people it's important to

00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,810
keep on it's important for the m's if

00:16:52,160 --> 00:17:00,170
they can't do it as I say something

00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:03,500
about it yeah they think one of the

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:08,030
points that I that have taken long for

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:11,150
me is when when it was not clear the

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,520
person should be accepted I mean the one

00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,310
time I two times have rejected somebody

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,340
one time it took me several months for

00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:22,430
well for for him to accept that he was

00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:25,010
not ready and and well I I just deferred

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:29,060
it and it remained like an open process

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:36,740
to be reopened for many years until it

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:39,530
was finally closed just I mean so had

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,660
been cases where it's very difficult

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,820
because it's um I mean it's a case which

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,890
is easy so if an applicant is perfect

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,930
you can just vote for them some so all

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,100
those things

00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,200
applicants I learned more from the

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,090
applicants an applicant for me so yeah

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,130
so as his cases says the case of it's

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,130
obviously they're not ready which has

00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,560
flied to Fonda says forget it come back

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,900
in a year it's also easy but source who

00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,460
are mostly lady who are it helps even

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,370
that you're not technical ever saw

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,780
yes understand all of horeb in works

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:13,190
technically but you're bloody sure

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,870
Savage has be a total amount of of

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,450
issues for the blood check this

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:20,810
shouldn't be developers sees as a heart

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:23,300
was really hard to deal with and yeah I

00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:25,010
saw a few names that came to my mind and

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,930
it's that's not an easy one

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:39,290
it stinks it goes in old people nerve so

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:41,240
yeah in those cases working out how to

00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,010
say D it to the applicant you're not

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,990
early ready and I don't want to carry on

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,220
with you and not to make it feel like a

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:51,890
rejection and I'm quite happy for those

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,830
cases to come back to front desk and and

00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,640
we can the account managers can can do

00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,640
the ridge

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,659
deferment if you like in your place if

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,230
it's a pretty face

00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:06,929
- if it's becoming a problem - to do the

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,640
human side of it you said before you

00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:10,679
would like more account manager learn

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,110
about becoming everyone who is account

is anybody thinking of applying oh yeah

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:05,110
sometimes it's actually also a little

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,570
bit hard to decide from from application

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,120
manager side if the people already so

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,620
you have brilliant people you know from

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,860
the first May there would be a brilliant

00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,660
DD and you have I never had this you

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,080
have that you have one which are clearly

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:22,960
not ready but you have also something in

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,890
between which you say yeah I could work

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,940
out I think one thing which could be in

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:34,540
you serious kind of matrix or kind kind

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:37,480
of idea about questions we ask what we

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:40,480
expect is overly also maybe as

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,510
application manager get some get around

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,200
the same level what is acceptable not so

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:59,230
I'm not sure I am especially hard a.m.

00:20:47,200 --> 00:21:01,620
or not or I don't know some guidelines

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:11,230
for aims to

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:12,790
decide if they are near the benchmark

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,380
I've scribbling on here which is a note

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,890
to myself to come back to this at some

00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,450
point

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:21,250
but yeah the the question templates are

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,290
quite useful for aims and but of course

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,809
there's no cost bonding answers because

00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,370
because what we don't want is for an

00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,960
applicant to just go snip the answers

00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:35,860
and there they go look I'm gonna Maisie

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:38,850
didi so I wonder if some some kind of

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:43,179
indication of all of those technical

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:45,640
aspects for a Em's only would be useful

00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:47,230
and also some at some kind of indication

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,840
of what we're expecting socially which

00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,640
which i think is more where you're where

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:58,240
whether where the difficulty is on those

00:21:51,640 --> 00:22:01,090
I think I'm thinking and thinking mostly

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,610
of the PMP the policy and procedures

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,700
parts yes yeah those are more the

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,679
judgment that the social judgment part

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,480
Tuscan skills it because it's a

00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,169
technical thing is easier to evaluate on

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:18,010
those zones yes I'll come back to those

00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:21,220
is somebody in IRC I can't see my window

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:24,000
in this resolution and I don't know what

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,000
somebody just asked me

00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:46,890
to incumbent from Iasi no format for

00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:49,240
basically it has been suggested to say

00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,710
it sounds like fun tests ought to be

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,390
looking at applications have been more

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:59,200
than a month of ping is a application

00:22:52,390 --> 00:23:01,929
manager yes and we found that when that

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,270
can happen that that's a pinging the

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:07,900
application manager or the applicant at

00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:09,940
the same time can be enough just a nudge

00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,580
the process back into either either

00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:16,210
being coming back to front desk or

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,770
thought of finishing off the difficulty

00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,740
for us there is that we're currently

00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,030
struggling for front desk time and so

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,400
that isn't happening because it's

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:28,690
because it's not so crucial so having

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,920
AMS progressing up the front desk would

00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:40,170
be a really really great thing at the

00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:42,670
moment and there's a link into the

00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:45,100
Debian wiki just appearing in the

00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,440
minutes you probably might find useful

00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:53,530
for that so it's called front desk slash

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:56,320
a.m. tutorial and I pretty sure it will

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:59,610
need some work but maybe maybe your

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,610
experience is valuable there as well

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:16,860
I was you're gonna say something good

00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:27,510
wait so is anybody thinking of applying

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:33,990
oh good okay thinking maybe not to just

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:35,940
might get press-ganged it was somebody

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:39,110
to somebody wait on that good okay

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,110
expect them actively

00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:53,840
yeah so I'm very new to Debian but it

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:56,059
looks very interesting and I think I'm

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,279
not experienced enough for that now with

00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,840
a bit more experience I hope to apply

00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:09,890
for this and get through through the

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:11,809
process would you do you think you would

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:14,120
want to take a technical track or o or a

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:15,440
non-technical track I'm sorry do you

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,299
think you would want to take a technical

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,070
view or or a non-technical I would like

00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:24,230
to help with translation because I'm not

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:30,139
a native English speaker but I would

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:33,649
like to help with technical as well so

00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:35,450
the Mary I have a little question

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:37,820
because I don't know the answer for that

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,440
so we have the uploading disease and

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,500
non-diplomatic disease you have a

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:47,809
process to go from non uploading to a

00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:51,260
protein DT it has happened it's manual

00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:52,549
because because it happened when we

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,070
weren't expecting it so we have a

00:25:52,549 --> 00:26:03,799
resource but it yes it really should

00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:07,179
advertise it graduating from DM to DD is

00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:09,830
trivial and that's self service

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:11,570
graduating from non uploading to upload

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,529
it year and second graduating from non

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,870
uploading to uploading is

00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:17,870
straightforward but we but we do it

00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:20,779
manually what we currently can't cater

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:24,049
for but are going to need to find a way

00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:26,720
to soon is people who are an on

00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:28,639
uploading DD because they don't because

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,139
they do do some technical work but don't

00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:33,559
want to be able to access the whole

00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:35,149
archive but do want to have DM on some

00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,460
packages so they can upload just those

00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:40,399
and that breaks us at the moment

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:43,399
completely so that if there is enough

00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:44,870
demand for that then we we are going to

00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:46,970
need to find a way of automating that at

00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:49,399
the moment we can kind of do it with

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,640
some fudging manually but it's not very

00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:54,670
pretty in the database

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,380
anyways it's obvious that some who needs

00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:58,240
to be some way from debin developers

00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,930
become uploading ones so that's not a

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,970
question

00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:02,860
so Asura's ready to greet the process I

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:06,010
think so non uploading is already an

00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:08,140
huge exception so to make a huge

00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:09,250
exception and a small step for that I'm

00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,320
not sure if it's Lilly did some

00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,330
automation or just shouldn't be handled

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,040
manually I said Pat beans per previous

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,680
years and I think we have seen that

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,600
happening so you have I not yeah at the

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,610
moment it is just not enough demand for

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,330
it to do it automatically manual is fine

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:28,750
for now we have a 18 non uploading

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:31,530
developers 800 uploading developers so

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:35,340
if one of them wants to bother us did

00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:35,340
doesn't really add much overhead

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,630
actually my question wasn't about the

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,820
technical side just to say people that

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:48,460
it's not written I mean in the stone

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,250
that you can still change or access

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:53,590
later in the future which is was not

00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:56,920
very clear for me it was the case or not

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,620
that's on but basically if somebody says

00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:02,050
I'm not sure if I'm already let's say

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:04,450
Technic enough to become a developer my

00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,700
recommendation is to something to work

00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:08,260
there confirm it or we can help for

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,390
example committing patches committing

00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,460
translations which trust doesn't need to

00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:15,850
be anything inside sure if you have to

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:17,680
like exercise to get archives to

00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,320
something like Japan maybe maintainer

00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,600
there could take care of packages and

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,920
after you have done it a bit you were

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,720
more familiar with step you and you were

00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,000
more familiar with the procedures you

00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,100
also could more easily show that you

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,410
have done useful work so if you have

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,240
done lots of good patches anybody base

00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,250
oh yeah obviously he has done good

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,290
things for two or three years for C

00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,840
packages so we know it works so it's

00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,770
much easier so if you're unsure to start

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,820
working on it

00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,890
and don't think too much about

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,200
procedures procedures little follow if

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,670
you done good work you know of at least

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,800
one case was I'm going to became a

00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,720
developer uploading developer without

00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,700
having ever maintained a package because

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,340
he has shows that he actually has the

00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:01,560
skills does it so yes that works the the

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,750
the key to

00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,820
what applications that we just get over

00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,680
and done with is that your am can just

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,030
go and have a look at you you have a

00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,540
look at the work that you've already got

00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:14,550
in the put in the archive or in

00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,230
translations or whatever and go tick

00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,960
tick tick tick tick tick ask a couple of

00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,780
questions for the missing bits done

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:26,580
that's the gold standard that were after

00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:29,700
did the reputation is probably fair in

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,130
lots of cases because it's easy for that

00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,110
to get run into the sand when it's

00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,750
somebody who isn't quite got that

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:40,100
history to go and have a look at but it

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,100
is getting better I promise

00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,290
so I've scribbled on the minutes that we

00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:50,550
should probably be advertising those

00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:53,910
pathways better like getting from non

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:55,620
uploading to uploading but we could do

00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,560
with somebody to write documentation for

00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:02,150
that so if you fancy writing some pages

00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,150
for Debian org that would be amazing

00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:10,800
may I ask a translation has been

00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,840
mentioned once or twice I think in just

00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,990
this example in my case I'm interested

00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,490
in getting GNU cache translated and I

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,950
looked around and it seemed like you

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,080
have to download the code and go and do

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,960
your translation file and then compile

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,580
it them and that is not what I'm

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,830
interested in I just want the file

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,860
that's translated then somehow plug it

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:34,350
in my copy and get it running

00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,480
I don't mind forwarding the file some

00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:42,960
way but the point is how does this fit

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:45,420
in so that's a little outside where I'm

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,370
where I'm normally working but I have

00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:52,020
touched it in the past so this may not

00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:58,890
be up to date but in the in the past in

00:30:52,020 --> 00:31:00,420
some cases there were a set of mailing

00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,460
lists for the languages and as

00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:05,250
developers need translations taking

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,080
place they can they'll mail the right

00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,990
file to the mailing list and the

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,640
translators can do what they need to and

00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,160
send the file back again

00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,660
so it should be more streamlined than

00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,840
you're describing

00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:20,310
and I'm sure it is the I'm not the best

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,020
person to help you with it at the moment

00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:26,160
the translation team I can put you in

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:29,430
touch with if I could add something to

00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,500
this I am new to Debian but I worked

00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:34,650
with Android in the past there's this

00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,030
online service called crowdin so Android

00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,280
applications have also have their

00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,110
transitions in one single file so what a

00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,780
developer can do is just upload all the

00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:46,140
files to that service and people can

00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:48,150
just go sign up and just edit directly

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,740
and the developer is the one who is

00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,020
responsible for getting the transitions

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,120
updated so if there is some false

00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,710
alternative or if that is false or if

00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,140
there is some faust service like that

00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:00,150
which could be set up then transition

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:03,900
would be as easy as just hanging up and

00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:05,190
entering the strings so what you do at

00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,250
this point is go and talk to the

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:10,500
translation teams and find out if what

00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,000
they do at the moment is what you think

00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:19,920
is a great way of doing it and if not

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,740
help them change it there's no

00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:28,260
translation if it sort of steered by

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:30,960
Debian there are translation teams doing

00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,280
that work within Debian but I did this

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,530
is mmm

00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,120
somewhat removed from where I'm normally

00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:41,400
working so there they're the best people

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:43,290
to talk to about it basically says

00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,450
debate says the difference between

00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,640
Debian and other projects in that regard

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,590
I mean Debian has not a single they say

00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,720
source code archive everything is kept

00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:54,150
people are using keepsies there's a lot

00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,430
we used to have subversion a lot but

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,290
basically ever developer studio ever

00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:01,680
maintained of a package was free to do

00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:03,510
it as it fits census translations so the

00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,620
a bit of translation teams where things

00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:10,110
are centralized I'm pretty sure the big

00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,540
ones like like hey de or chrome have

00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:15,240
their ways to deal with it but they also

00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:17,010
had a lot of upstream translations or

00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,780
they don't do to her - as much as that

00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:23,130
for smaller ones really different and

00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,590
translations it's definitely one of the

00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:29,440
parts we could get or to do things

00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:32,090
better so for the moment it's just it's

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,520
good enough such peopIe are not upset

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,380
enough that circular going to improve it

00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,850
which now could be something good

00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,960
because it's working good enough and

00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,990
something bad because we're not

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,350
improving it so but if somebody is the D

00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:47,000
willing to do it and speak with local

00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,530
organization teams I think such as an

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,200
area of Deputies that also could need

00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,610
more help but doesn't leadership but or

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,530
badly enough said

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,450
I said now one of the persons who is

00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,850
hate him ever it's just it's burning

00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:01,940
it's doing that but of course I'm not

00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:03,860
sure any of us of us here will be happy

00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,320
to help you finding raises those team or

00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,480
finding people to do that but yes that's

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,250
something else and happy to find people

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,900
who are doing it ourselves so if you

00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,790
want to lose that I have more to us than

00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:17,320
that please speak to us and we will try

00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,320
to find people you could speak this

00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:34,290
and how we do for time anything else

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,340
yes please

00:34:51,139 --> 00:35:04,339
please be nice I'm always nice so how

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:09,660
many AMS do we have at the moment son I

00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:10,680
don't know stop my head yes you can

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:16,560
probably do it quicker than I can on

00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:19,589
this machine we have sufficient that at

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:26,240
times we manage to not have a queue for

00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:31,170
a very brief period but so it has yes

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,700
occasionally what we what we find is

00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,790
that we get bursts of applications

00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,730
around some key times like after this

00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:40,079
week is always a busy one and then

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,869
there's a couple of other conferences

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,990
around and gsok results in applications

00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:47,130
so so in the quiet periods we can choose

00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,500
through people quite quickly and we

00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,570
almost get back to equilibrium but then

00:35:49,500 --> 00:36:02,280
there is always a burst of applications

00:35:51,570 --> 00:36:03,930
that comes out with a queue there are 26

00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:10,410
listed application materials you have a

00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:12,990
max applicant of at least one my queue

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:17,160
depth the moment is currently six I

00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:20,160
think so those people are in the process

00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,530
and have done the paperwork they need to

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,660
to get to being assigned somebody but

00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:30,089
are then just waiting that there are

00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:31,079
five slots available it may not take

00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:35,609
account of the difference between you

00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:37,140
and all-star processes I'm I'm currently

00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:40,160
not occupied in the part on that I don't

00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,160
think there were only in the spot

00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:47,540
how much of a difference is there if

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,300
you're applying as an on uploading DD

00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,860
and uploading lili I mean I'm actually

00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:57,190
looking for documentation about non

00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:57,190
uploading ad if one were to go for that

00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:07,460
so every apart from collab mate which is

00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,680
special everybody goes through the same

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:12,190
beginning process which is you need to

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,530
have an alley off account because that's

00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:21,170
so that's the you know thing where the

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:23,210
collab mate comes from that's how we tie

00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:25,130
all your bits together with some

00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:32,150
identity because email address is in

00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:34,010
very well with that you go to here and

00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:46,930
there was an application page and you

00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:51,280
either choose to do DM DD u DD and you

00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:54,680
if your DM then you get an advocate to

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,420
support your application and then there

00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,890
are four days for any objections to

00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,920
arrive and assuming that there aren't

00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:05,480
you go straight to keyring and you join

00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:09,370
the keyring if you are a DD you you need

00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:13,220
to do the paperwork and the Advocate and

00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:15,100
then there are four days for objection

00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,290
the same as their off deed for DMS and

00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:21,880
then you are assigned an application

00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:25,250
manager and then you come back to Dan's

00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,890
Dan's will review the whole application

00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:31,220
and make a judgment call and then you go

00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,720
to queuing to be at it for a DD non

00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,060
uploading the process is exactly the

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,860
same for a DD uploading the difference

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,640
is in what your application manager will

00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:44,330
talk to you about so we have a set of

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:47,630
pre formatted questions for both firth

00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:49,250
or uploading applications which your am

00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,110
will pick and choose from for the bits

00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,780
that they can't find evidence of in the

00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,460
archive for not uploading it's a little

00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,680
more fuzzy

00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,450
is the there are so many areas you can

00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,820
be working in so your application

00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,990
manager will probably say show me some

00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,150
examples of where you've been working

00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,680
and you can do that and they can go and

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,940
have a look they can have a look at the

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,980
ones that you haven't shown them and

00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,960
make sure that you're not just picking

00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,380
and choosing and then they'll make the

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,859
recommendation the same so for Dede

00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,970
regardless of whether you're uploading

00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:19,660
you aren't learning the process is

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:21,220
really very simple everything starts

00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,230
with an alley off account and then you

00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,089
log and then you solve it to them and

00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,710
then when you start the process you get

00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:30,280
to choose from from which strands you

00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:38,190
want to start which pathway you want

00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:41,320
start with D D u and d DN use DSA tis

00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:43,180
once you hit key ring for DM you could

00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:46,089
be added to dike by any deer but Debian

00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,830
developer DD u DD nu you need DSA to

00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:49,510
create the account first and they're

00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:52,599
pretty quick about that yeah they are

00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:55,000
and we normally see that we normally see

00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,790
DSA create the actual accounts within

00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,040
hours or in or a day or so on

00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:02,619
the keyring maintainer x' work in a

00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,990
batch so there's sometimes a delay about

00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:06,940
stay work do you do monthlies or yes I

00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:10,359
am as the keyring we'll do an update at

00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:12,339
least once a month we can occasionally

00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:18,480
be convinced to do one faster but but in

00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:19,750
general once a month is somebody in IRC

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,849
yes

00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,849
would you mind relaying

00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,620
there's a question about if the

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:34,690
applicant can help the a.m. find the

00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:36,100
evidence yes and also there may fall off

00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:40,150
going without involved giving away too

00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:42,880
much about the questions um the

00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,530
questions are available if you go and

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,750
look for them so so while you're waiting

00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:48,790
to be assigned an application manager

00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,770
you might want to go have a look at what

00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,300
the questions are there there was

00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:54,280
another a.m. you know I can't remember

00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,930
who it was who explained that they went

00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,060
through the process with their applicant

00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,800
pretty much in a day because the

00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,420
applicant had already downloaded all of

00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,070
the questions worked out what the

00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,300
answers should be done all the research

00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,490
while they were waiting for their

00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,870
advocates to go through so essentially

00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,490
they cut and paste all the answers in

00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,110
backwards and forwards and had it all

00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:13,840
done within a day of the actual getting

00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,920
a embed yeah and the impression was it

00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,210
was fine because they've done the

00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,280
research themselves they could talk

00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,900
about it that was all fine I'm yeah I'm

00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,960
fine with that approach as long as

00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,030
they're they aren't copy paste from

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,010
someone else's answers right of course I

00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:30,310
have suggested some people that were

00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:32,440
thinking about becoming a DS well I have

00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:34,510
given them the address of the this

00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,150
repository with the questions for them

00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:40,870
to study because it's a great study

00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,730
guide and and well it's good resource

00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:47,170
and yes as you say if you already have

00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:52,180
it well easier for for the application

00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:53,950
manager to follow we do get suspicious

00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:57,370
if three applicants all come through in

00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:59,670
exactly the same answers though so at

00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:04,300
least we don't be too blatant about it

00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:07,540
but besides those yes it's more than

00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,550
fine to say to your a.m. look here's the

00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,290
work I've been doing that I don't

00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:14,140
problem there at all because we have

00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:15,280
tools to find that but they're not there

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,140
are still places where you might be

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,020
working where we our tools don't show

00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:23,470
you up so it's it's fine to say his

00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:26,620
here's some examples of my work I mean I

00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:29,230
was until last week and inactive am I

00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:31,030
have process people and stop doing

00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:33,160
himself for a long time one of the

00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:36,820
reasons I went back to being an am is

00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,500
that it helps developers like keep in

00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,590
touch with the latest practices

00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:44,440
I say people who are getting in Debian

00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:46,740
are following usually the latest trends

00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:51,820
and well I learned 10 years ago it's

00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:54,100
over 10 years ago yeah I certainly find

00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,600
being an am very rewarding I think there

00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,160
are very few applicants I've had and

00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,770
find out not show there any where I

00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,300
haven't learned something and even you

00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,950
know what we're on the same page seeing

00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,410
someone else's viewpoint and the way

00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,450
they answer the questions I find really

00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:09,100
interesting so if you haven't considered

00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,900
being an am and you've got some spare

00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,370
time I would certainly look into it

00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,140
process maybe a couple people and see

00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,690
how you find it because it is really and

00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,070
also pretty nice too down the line see

00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,590
those people contributed to Debian and

00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,330
go I helped get them in I mean so my

00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,160
applicants are hundreds of times more

00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,720
active and Debbie and than I am and I

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:33,070
sort of feel a little better I have that

00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:35,440
happen so how do I actually become an am

00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,700
female front desk is that all as I say I

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,100
would like to be an a.m. please sign

00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,570
your mail so that we don't owe you an

00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,530
applicant and then you say what I don't

00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:43,060
know anything about this because I was

00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,560
just looking through the site to see to

00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,310
be able to push a button to say you may

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,780
not be in a and there isn't one no not

00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:52,440
no not at the moment maybe I should do

00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:56,410
that but otherwise I'd have just done it

00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,960
no email front desk and we will give you

00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:01,480
one applicants to start with who's who

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,390
looks uncontroversial not that we have

00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,700
many controversial ones and at the end

00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:08,500
of the first one we'll have a look in

00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,850
more detail with you and make sure that

00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,970
you were happy with all bits and the one

00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:14,620
any queries and so on and then and then

00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:16,390
from then on you set the number of slots

00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,620
to the amount of time you have and if

00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,620
I've got someone I'll fill a slot

00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:36,490
fill the alternative way of doing it is

00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:39,130
to realize that you've been around since

00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:46,270
since the year 2000 and not your number

00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:48,130
of slots did yes that's also a good

00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:51,460
point you as an am your number two just

00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:53,440
ignore my word as an a.m. if you don't

00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,720
have time for applicants right now you

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,099
can set your slots to zero and and until

00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,140
you put them back to one again you won't

00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:01,359
you will you won't be bothered by us so

00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,609
it's not a commitment in perpetuity to

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,740
to have a queue of people at your door

00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:12,849
you can say I don't have time at the

00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:14,980
moment there's a time when I was working

00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:18,339
late am i found it more easy to process

00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,990
the applicants in parallel at times and

00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:22,119
asked have no board it because if I seem

00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:24,550
parallel I am pretty much sure I'm not

00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:26,290
just saying oh yes this one is whatever

00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,359
I'm it's easier to quote to keep our own

00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:30,220
standards if I have a few in parallel

00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,990
and then not to ask the applicants at

00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:35,619
all other times that was easier for me

00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:37,450
than having just one in serious other

00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:40,290
people might make it different so trust

00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,290
my own experience

00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:54,850
right we should probably wrap up unless

00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:56,650
there is anything else so I'm here until

00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:58,180
Saturday I'm more than happy if you did

00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,680
grab me in the corridor and have a chat

00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:02,440

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,050
keyring maintainer czar here all week if

00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:14,650
