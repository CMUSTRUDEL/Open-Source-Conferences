hello great welcome back

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,040
Amelia will be telling us about the

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,509
release team and what you can do to help

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:17,430
to make the stretch release possible

00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:19,050
thank you okay so yes my name is Amelia

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,170
I'm release manager for straight

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,510
together with nails just in there I'm

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,060
going to be talking about how can you

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,670
help make the distorts the stretch

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,340
release possible how can you make how

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,420
can you help and make the fries shorter

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,399
and useful until I tell you a little bit

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,120
about the procedures the new changes in

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,180
the in the frist policy and I'm some

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,860
surprises at the end are you so first of

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,539
all let's start with the with the

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:56,129
released in as I said Nilsson and myself

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:59,280
are the release managers then there's

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:04,530
Adam Julianna Philip taking care of

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,479
stable under a serial Philippe avoid

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,600
jonathan and midi are religious distance

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,820
so we work as a team everyone can take

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,010
care of anything but the stable release

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,009
managers they release managers have the

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:21,150
last worry if there's any controversy or

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:23,880
any hard decision to make if you want to

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,000
join come tell us we're always looking

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,710
for people to help with with all the

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,700
work that we do with the with the tools

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,860
that we use

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,280
so we're get in touch if if you're

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:39,329
interested now let's look at the

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,670
timeline for first rate the fridge was

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,640
going to be the fifth of November back

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,320
but we pushed it back two months so on

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,619
November the fifth we're going to stop

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,270
accepting new transitions if you have

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,110
any transitions planned please let us

00:01:51,270 --> 00:02:01,729
know especially if they are big as the

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:05,430
deadline is is in its very very near

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:07,890
then on December December the 5th we

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,860
will stop ignoring we will start

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,780
ignoring agencies so what packages will

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,630
need 10 days to migrate to testing

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,670
if if for some reason your package needs

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,510
to migrate sooner than that perhaps

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,950
because of a security fix then let us

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:29,620
know if you can great us an email or

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:31,630
something and and we'll we'll push it we

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:37,540
will also take a final look at the

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:39,760
architectures for straight we see if any

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,110
problems can come up and we need to drop

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,070
an architecture or something but

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:47,050
hopefully it will all be fine and on

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,230
generally the fifth the the there will

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,260
be we will have the soft freeze so from

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:58,870
that point on no new packages will enter

00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:02,560
testing updates can still go in but if

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,680
you have a new package plant you need to

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,959
get it in testing before that which

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,970
means you should upload it ten days

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,420
before that and plan for any possible

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:18,549
release critical bugs so get it in there

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:21,190
soon also also be aware of you should be

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:23,290
aware of auto removals so your packets

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,170
can be removed from testing be careful

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:31,390
with that because if it gets removed it

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:34,299
won't come back in and then on February

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,360
the 5th is the hard freeze from this

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:39,790
point on you will need to request an

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,209
unblocked if you have any updates to

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,540
your packages for back fixes or anything

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:49,209
as usual and hopefully not too long

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,410
after that we will release and we can

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:55,299
party and drink and enjoy so winter is

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,640
coming and the freeze is coming with it

00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:01,540
and I'm gonna tell you something I hope

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:08,799
that this isn't the longest winter in

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:12,610
history second yeah well yeah hopefully

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:16,900
it won't be it won't last too long now

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:20,079
let's talk about the DRC bags or give

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,750
maybe not that kind of 4c bars but

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,940
release critical bags we have a very

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,340
thousand bucks right now affecting

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:31,930
testing according

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:34,500
- you DD of those 300 bags were recently

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,389
filled for the gc6 transition and

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:42,010
another 300 were feel for the Deaf

00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:44,110
helper compatibility deprecations but

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,400
only about 300 are affecting key

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:51,190
packages this is a very nice number the

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,590
other 700 are affecting packages that

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,470
can't be removed from testing if they

00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:00,610
don't get fixed if the Manta maintainer

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,470
doesn't react or anything so so it'd be

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,510
nice if they are fixed but if they're

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,360
not they won't block the release however

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,880
these 300 release critical bags these

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,880
are the ones we we really need to look

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,240
at this is the graph of the of the

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,139
release critical bags this is the point

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:28,050
when of the Jessie released and the

00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:33,669
freeze I think was around here right

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:36,310
November yeah so so if as you can see

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:38,080
the number of released critical bags was

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:45,310
about the same before the freeze except

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:48,460
for this which is which is this - this

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,830
is the Deaf helper compatibility release

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,800
critical bags and this is due 66 but

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,110
then in a month from now that the auto

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,610
removals will start removing those and

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:03,430
it will go down again so fixer package

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,650
if you don't want the removed we have a

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,720
problem with unstable so many bugs there

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:12,090
I think we should start out Auto

00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:16,590
removing packages from there but that's

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:21,160
that's a discussion for another day and

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:23,340
the pic seen in this table this picks

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,570
this pick and the speaker because

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:30,870
whoever filled those release critical

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:36,010
box use their own tags but that fixed

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:38,919
now auto removals okay maybe maybe not

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,280
this kind or maybe we will remove your

00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,340
car

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,400
don't fix your backs what see yeah so

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:49,540
other removals help help a lot as you as

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,730
you can see we don't have numbers right

00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,250
now because we just realized that we

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:58,120
haven't been keeping the the data in a

00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,490
machine possible way but us but we will

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,730
take that for for next year but they

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,880
help you have probably seen many many

00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:09,310
packages being removed and at the

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:15,600
difference here between testing and

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:18,220
unstable is because of that in a big way

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:23,980
so we will keep and removing packages

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:26,740
from testing even during the freeze and

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:30,700
packages that get removed one winter so

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:34,060
be careful now transitions transitions

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,680
are being very smooth thanks to some

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,880
changes that we have implemented this

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,570
cycle like crafts is ignored for testing

00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,610
migration this helps transitions because

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,830
when you rename the library the old

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,550
library doesn't need to be removed for

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:53,830
the for the new version to migrate which

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,780
means the transition can can move to

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,470
testing very quickly and then it can be

00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,539
finished a bit later

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,610
this also means we can we can start

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:07,810
another transition before the first one

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:11,140
finishes if they even if they if they

00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,919
collide so we are accepting transistors

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:16,240
very quickly usually in less than a day

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,700
as long as you provide the necessary

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,620
information like did you tested the

00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,530
reverse dependencies and everything and

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,900
you come with us with that information

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,030
so there's no reason not to not to

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,660
report a transition bar and wait for

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:34,300
wait for for the goal so please do that

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:40,120
especially with big transitions so we

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:42,789
can avoid the collisions and the freeze

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:47,470
is coming for transitions in November as

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:50,709
you saw so please if you want to do have

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,190
a transition to make Planet file about

00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:53,190
whatever

00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:02,290
yes mood transitions and maybe not that

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:04,180
smooth but so how to how to make a

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,040
transition at the ideal weight you

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,230
upload your picture to experimental to

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,940
carry the new cue to go through new and

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,810
then you get a transition tracker

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,750
auto-generated you don't need to ask

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,490
anybody it's very nice and there we can

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,130
see if there are collisions with other

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,460
ongoing transitions or with other

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:28,660
planned transitions or or anything the

00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:30,370
second step and make sure your public's

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,650
bills if it doesn't build you need to

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,590
fix that before the transition can start

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,420
and rebuild your reverse dependencies

00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:42,040
this is one of the things that people

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:44,410
forget about or that people maybe people

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,290
are lazy and don't want to do it but it

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,990
is the biggest because the most

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,660
important thing we build your reverse

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:56,350
dependencies and uncheck that day if

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,690
they need changes for your API changes

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,210
or or patches or anything or if they

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,300
just it can be rebuilt after the

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:09,160
transition starts and then report a bag

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:10,870
for the transition and you could upload

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,060
it a red leaf it's a very small

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,980
transition maybe a couple of packages

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,970
that you maintain and that you can take

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:22,300
care of yourself just your own judgement

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:25,120
but defeats have if your library has two

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:28,090
devs then please check with the release

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:33,580
and the BAM boot as it can affect a very

00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:36,460
installer release so proposed updates

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,670
for stable and unstable I'm going to

00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,410
quickly remind you about the procedure

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,080
it's very important that I mean the bags

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:47,950
that you want to fix in stable must be

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:51,130
fixed in a stable sometimes the backs

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,630
are fixed but pitting people the be

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:57,640
tears doesn't have the the right

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:59,680
information so we we get confused under

00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,620
stable release managers get a bit grumpy

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,260
so so make sure that BTS has the

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,470
information so so we can just so we

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,950
don't

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,080
to ask about that and then report a bag

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:14,170
and you should include a justification

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,470
why you have to fit it's important to

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,690
fix this bag tell us about the back

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,510
numbers that you're fixing and under

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:25,360
severe it is 18 change log entry and

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,220
insource depth if not a binary depth if

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,970
but the search one between stable or

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:35,290
stable security and and your and your

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:40,570
your proposed update and wait for an AK

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:43,210
before you upload this to stable now the

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,350
first policy for straight we have made

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:50,050
kind of a few changes I don't think this

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,560
is updated yet but we will we will push

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,450
it whisper soon the the free Cisco is

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,620
going to be gradual

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:01,690
as you saw and in the fridge we will

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:08,170
accept a fixes for release critical bags

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:10,740
also for important bags and always be

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,970
unstable not proposed updates and

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:17,320
translation updates or documentation

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:20,680
fixes there won't be automatic and

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,650
blocks so if you upload your packets two

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,020
days before the freeze it won't get an

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:29,380
automatic exception you will have to

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:32,110
request an on block so it will be easier

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,720
if you upload it ahead of time you know

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,930
so it migrates before the freeze but if

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,530
not you can request a non-black a lot

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:44,290
about auto removals one change is that

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:48,100
they cannot be migrated if your package

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:51,850
gets auto removed during the freeze

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:56,290
there won't be an exception for it this

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:58,450
is a change from the JC release so don't

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,520
assume any packet is safe from removal

00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,920
because we might remove it before the

00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,930
the auto remover kicks in if it's

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:09,670
blocking some something else or whatever

00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:14,830
don't wait till the last day to fix to

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:18,430
fix the packet unblock request this is

00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,120
important for the for the phrase please

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,910
we

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,520
quarterback don't come on IRC and say

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,600
hey I want to fix this back and I do you

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,960
think this is sensible

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,410
instead of asking on IRC just ask on a

00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,140
bug report and you should always include

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:38,320
the justification for why this update

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,170
what ask you are fixing and they search

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,250
the belief between testing and your

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:50,589
proposed update or your update there's

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:52,710
no need for pre-approval we trust your

00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:56,170
judgment that you will upload and

00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:58,750
sensible stuff right so you can go ahead

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,670
and upload to unstable and after that

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:05,080
you can wait a few days if you want make

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:07,990
sure it builds everywhere there no new

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,390
release no new bug reports are reported

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:15,370
about your questions and then request

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:16,960
the unlock the the pre-approval wastes

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,300
our time because we have to look it a

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,110
head of it then later when when you

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,900
upload so well if you are really unsure

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,410
about something you can ask but if you

00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:33,240
think it's right then you can go ahead

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:37,779
so architecture for straight we have a

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:41,320
the x86 the arms mix and nip sell

00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:46,810
PowerPC 64 little-endian honest 390

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:50,440
these were already in Jesse lip 64 year

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:53,080
lease a candidate and I think this

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,450
morning the last pivot that maybe they

00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,370
rebuild was fixed we have the VSA

00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:00,040
hardware it's an amine in the main

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,940
archive so we are going to bootstrap it

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,850
in testing

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,540
person so it's very likely that they

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:12,089
will be released in straight and we have

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:14,350
concerns about about PowerPC and FreeBSD

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:16,240
these are concerns about the manpower

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:20,680
the the number of ported

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,080
porters basically so if you are

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,190
interested in seeing any of this or you

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:30,010
are a porter and want to support this

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,920
and will be working on this we will have

00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,170
a call for porters very soon

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,929
so please reply to that and let us know

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:42,670
so we can we can make a decision about

00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:45,879
that now for stretch and we expect to

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:49,089
shape links for 10 this is the reason

00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:53,189
that we delayed the the freeze because

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:57,100
the 14 release is going to be LTS

00:15:53,189 --> 00:16:00,160
otherwise by the time if we shaped with

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:04,449
the with the kernel from from November

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:08,529
or October by the time of their release

00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:12,399
it would be almost enough life we will

00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:13,809
also have GCC six six point three five

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,579
nine two point seven that didn't change

00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:21,939
of course but three point five paralysis

00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:23,709
expected to be 524 we have five twenty

00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:32,309
two right now but we have a transition

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:32,309
plant and genome 222 and KDE 1608 second

00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:48,369
322 s right my bad you know people don't

00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:53,949
like no three so we're going back now

00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:56,889
how can you help obviously if you upload

00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:58,779
something to too unstable that this

00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,540
segment for for the release during the

00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,970
freeze that disrupts many things

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,880
especially if your package has reverse

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,240
dependencies if it's a library so don't

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,220
do that don't introduce new transitions

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,860
don't upload things that you don't mean

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:18,209
for straight to unstable you can use

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:21,339
experimental I know experimental isn't

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:25,149
picked up by default and all of that but

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:28,779
the freeze should be should be short we

00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:30,700
hope we hope that it will be short so so

00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:32,110
if you do to that that will help that

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,299
will help us

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:37,899
so packages don't have to go through

00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:42,669
proposed updates fixed release critical

00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:44,620
bars the list is there as do so the

00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:46,510
sooner we fix them the sooner we release

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,059
so so

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:53,230
we need that especially those affecting

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:55,559
key packages the other ones it's nice to

00:17:53,230 --> 00:18:00,490
fix them but if we don't fix them

00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:02,799
packages can be removed so and you can

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:06,700
organize or participate in a box

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:10,780
question party also we need people

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:14,470
testing the upgrade from Jessie to

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:18,460
straights and the installation process

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:22,240
new installs please do that if you can

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,860
and report any problems that you find or

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,880
successes for the installation process

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:33,309
as its usual and to their respective

00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:35,380
packages if you if you have something

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:37,570
important for the release notes your

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,390
package has something some important

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:44,309
taste change that should be mentioned

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:47,650
you can file a bag with some explanation

00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:49,690
so it can be included and if you need

00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:53,169
something from the release team like Ben

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:57,940
and banana module or something don't

00:18:53,169 --> 00:19:00,790
don't leave a note on on your packets

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,130
back report I hope that we see it come

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:05,500
to us file a bug report against release

00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:09,700
that we end the tour so we so we don't

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,950
miss it and then we can act on it now

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,429
how to contact us is if you know if you

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,429
need anything

00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,690
report report Bart released that we on

00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,200
the turf or anything that we handle

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:25,750
through through the bug tracker this is

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,850
important so so we don't miss it if you

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:32,460
send an email we are going to be flooded

00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:35,140
by bye-bye emails during the freeze with

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,510
with um doc requests and so many things

00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:44,140
it's usin an email it's very easy for it

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:46,390
to be missed so file a part report for

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,290
other things you can you can contact us

00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:59,850
please by report people people forget

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,370
about these people come on IRC and ask

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:06,930
can I have this transition can you can

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:11,850
you be nanum give this package it's it's

00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:14,910
better if you file a bi report you can

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,550
also combinations come on on IRC for for

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:20,790
other things or if you need a live

00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:27,660
discussion about something and report

00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:29,670
back this and finally so general

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:43,550
straights plus one is going to be buster

00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:46,980
and Buster plus 1 would be bullseye and

00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:49,980
I want to thank Debian and Calabria for

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,460
bringing me here and if you have any

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:57,050
questions please go ahead about Debian

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,050
or Game of Thrones or whatever

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,070
hello

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,910
how did MIPS end up as a police

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:32,360
architectures a big animal being the

00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:33,140
only it's very tupid we canyon know what

00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,670
is the question again

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,390
how did it then as a release

00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:40,940
architecture yes well there's a lot of

00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:44,000
hardware there were people port in it

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,870
and so on so so it became one and as

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,790
long as it keeps being supported

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:52,100
upstream and we have porters and there's

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:55,480
hardware there's no reason to drop it of

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:59,270
course if if upstream support falls

00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:05,510
falls apart I think the word problems

00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:08,600
with with a Lipsy or the kernel answer

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:11,750
if problems come up we might drop it at

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,580
some point and that's possibly that will

00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:16,250
happen in the future at some point but

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:22,880
it's not happening for stretch we will

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:26,060
see other goals in the future I question

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,060
from IOC could you elaborate a bit on

00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:32,030
the reasons for disallowing reentry of

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,860
auto remove packages in particular if

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,420
the auto remove package is a build

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:39,310
dependency of something else that would

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,310
otherwise have qualified for the release

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:51,650
right over it yourself yeah so so if

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:56,750
it's a been dependency that's that's

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:59,330
basically the same thing all packages in

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:03,080
the chain will are notified by the I

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:07,900
believe by the auto removal tool if not

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:11,390
let us know and we will fix that but if

00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:15,260
one of your dependencies have a bug

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:20,270
report and it doesn't get fixed and your

00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:22,100
package gets removed I mean there's

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,140
nothing preventing preventing the

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,090
maintainer of this package to fix the

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,570
other one so

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,700
or two people or or if this happens and

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,220
you cannot fix it on whatever you can

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,440
come and let us know and we might give

00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:43,370
an exception in this specific case but

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:52,279
but in principle if it gets remove then

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:56,980
it's removed so hello apparently we have

00:23:52,279 --> 00:24:01,820
users for PowerPC 32-bit big Indian

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:04,159
people still using this maybe this is

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,559
more a question for PowerPC Porter's if

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:12,490
they would be willing to switch to

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:15,470
switch the 64-bit began the user right

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:21,049
yeah that's something I want to take a

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:23,390
look at whether the PowerPC 32-bit I

00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:27,649
mean the PowerPC hardware can run on pbc

00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:29,990
64 or not and make sure it's like

00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:33,950
whether we have Porter's say with the

00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:37,549
PPC 64 Porter's and then we will need to

00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:40,730
make a decision but it's clear we have

00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:43,250
users of PowerPC so so we need to

00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,990
support which we would like to support

00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,570
them one way or another or another

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:56,360
whether it's through PowerPC 32 bits or

00:24:47,570 --> 00:25:00,230
through BBC 64 because I recently

00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:03,350
received an offer for sparc64 hardware

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:07,039
directly from the hardware vendor when

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:10,210
do you expect at the latest point to

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:13,370
include a new architecture in into your

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:17,120
release timeframe interest rates yes

00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:20,120
yeah that should happen as soon I mean

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,980
yes I mean I mean we haven't we haven't

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,380
heard anything about the spark system

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,669
for Porter's I think there was an email

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:32,990
on the on the qualification thread but

00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:37,179
we didn't get any direct email telling

00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,179
us that they want to include it

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:45,039
okay we can talk later but if you want

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,659
an architecture in stressed the things

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,820
that need to happen are that the

00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:50,889
hardware needs to be maintained by the

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,379
SA which you should you have an offer

00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:59,080
the port needs to be in the main archive

00:25:53,379 --> 00:26:02,169
and then we can we can think if we can

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,100
see if it can be added testing so I'm a

00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:10,629
missing something

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:14,109
in practice it's August September

00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:22,090
October November 12 weeks you probably

00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:24,009
pushing a lot for stretch yeah I saw

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:28,029
that the the the number of packages was

00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:42,519
very high like 11,000 out of the 12,000

00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:46,599
odd so we're currently at 10,800 binary

00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:48,940
arch packages on sparc64 it one guy

00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:51,669
recently James Clark I don't know if

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,369
he's here he's just a debian maintainer

00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:59,049
but he actually fixed a huge load of

00:26:54,369 --> 00:27:02,229
packages as for upstream Oracle's

00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:04,869
actually paying lots of developers now

00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:07,509
to to support Linux on spark they have

00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:10,690
their own distribution but they also

00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:14,080
like doing lots of upstream Eric and at

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:16,359
some point Oracle said that they would

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,989
be willing to donate hardware to Debian

00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:22,869
and that would be at least one hopefully

00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:26,139
to spark m7 servers which run at like

00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:29,460
forty thousand grand forty grand one

00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:31,869
server that was at 32 core machines

00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,720
right that's more or less the fastest

00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:37,749
you can get with spark yes so send us an

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,119
email maybe include the DSA team and you

00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:42,940
have to be master yeah DSA s is in the

00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:46,509
loop so yeah just a matter of like

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,549
Oracle like you know yeah it's moving

00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:50,840
they're like they're huge company and

00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:53,270
they take forever to yeah

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:56,150
know so we can know about this plan and

00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:59,600
and see if it's possible for stretchy if

00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:02,240
things move on and until as they'll tell

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,310
you the requirements that we have but

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,920
defeat if it's happens and everything

00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,510
looks fine then I think we'll be happy

00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,820
to include it and I just finished

00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,440
setting up the sparc64 Porter boxes

00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:16,570
someone wants to try okay

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,570
it's called not Gurudeva not that

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,030
there's any more questions

00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:33,160
not so much a question but a comment

00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,640
we're already planning for some BSP's in

00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,470
the UK we're gonna have to find more

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:44,320
stuff to do because you've done the auto

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:45,880
removals well there's the 300 release

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,650
good two gold bars so hopefully we'll

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,320
have some stuff to do but they take a

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:52,570
lot longer to actually fit

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,210
hahaha you can adjust remove those sure

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:58,540
so obviously it's great if all the

00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,970
people want to do BSP's - we're gonna

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,740
work or Jonathan and I are arguing over

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:09,010
who gets to host in the UK we might do

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:11,980
both at this haha again there - one in

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:19,630
Germany end of September beginning of

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:22,150
October les goes directly to Steve do we

00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,980
have an expectation on when the release

00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:27,900
candidates for the Debian installers

00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,900
will fit into those timeframes

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:39,620
to be honest that's up to Kibby we just

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:41,860
released di alpha 7 in fact he announced

00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:45,230
it was it last night early this morning

00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:48,530
I think we're probably ready to start

00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:50,720
calling them betas any time unless

00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:54,740
anyone has major things they want to put

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,050
into di you know we called in a male for

00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:00,200
so far because we haven't started

00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:02,770
getting close to a release yeah we're

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,770
ready to go I think

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:25,300
speaking about beddows in for di how's

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:28,400
it progressing on the artwork front so

00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,590
we sent out a proposal or a request for

00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,110
it and I haven't heard back from anybody

00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,060
yet unfortunately I think somebody

00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:38,690
created a bigger page for a single

00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:41,210
artwork but nobody actually showed up on

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,800
there and said I'm doing artwork so

00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:49,880
we're still looking for people to do

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:51,710
that and announce it it's there so

00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,680
there's one person who's created some

00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:58,000
artwork and it's on a wiki page and they

00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,000
haven't really talked to anyone though

00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:06,310
and if he knows

00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:16,509
okay thank you very much and see you

00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:16,509
