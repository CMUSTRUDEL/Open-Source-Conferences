next up is Medi Turkey who is currently

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:13,559
PL he's going to shake some bits from

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:16,500
the DPL hello

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,810
so my name is Medi I'm pretending to be

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,800
the DPL for the next year and I'm here

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,320
to talk to you about what's going Debian

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,359
so welcome to everybody I'm glad to be

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:33,570
here I'm glad to see you all here and so

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:38,010
thanks for the 16 team I know how the

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:41,910
work has been frustrating the energy

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:44,579
they put in thankful them for scattering

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,370
my talk during I mean just after the

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,640
season wine party so that everyone is

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:55,170
ready for the talk and thanks for the

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,629
university of captain for hosting us so

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,420
some funny facts about this conference

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:06,689
is the first time it's organized in

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:08,850
Africa it's really important for us to

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:15,240
reach out to new users new communities

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:18,799
new people so it's very important to dip

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,320
cough to change the country every year

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,630
continent so we're doing also a

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,220
conference about Linux is the first time

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,450
we're having a conference near Penguins

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,130
so that was important enough to say it

00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,189
it's also the first time we have a DPL

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,329
born in Africa and you can keep going

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,979
combining those funny facts so the last

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,720
one was important important important

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,600
for me because it shows how our

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,600
community is diverse and we want to I

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:57,350
mean we like it like that right and we

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,350
have to keep it that way

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:06,149
so how is defiantly going these days

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:08,700
some changes in the some teams so there

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,520
were delegations of Debian maintainer

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,900
skilling maintained errs and front desk

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,470
delegations we were

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:19,590
which were revoked the basis of the for

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,260
that was that the work didn't need in

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,620
delegation any special power to be

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,019
dedicated their work was mainly

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:34,680
administrative so a delegation was not

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:37,349
needed the one who needed delegation was

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,590
Debian account managers which are still

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:45,359
there it doesn't mean that those team

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,950
were will disappear just need that they

00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:49,879
don't need indication anymore so

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,709
everyone is I mean it's easier now to

00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,840
help them to get the work done and it's

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:59,129
very important to get it done so because

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:05,220
it's our way to get new members into the

00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:07,650
community other important stuff first

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,409
publicity on bits teams were combined

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,900
now we have only one team working on

00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:16,140
those subjects so taking care about

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,329
press releases publicity work and all

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:23,549
the communication that happens in the

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:30,599
bits blog also we have the auntie Raskin

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:33,599
team but we didn't maybe make big

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,010
promotion around it in the past but it's

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,169
somehow very important in our

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,250
organization to make sure that

00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:43,680
everything keeps going well and we have

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,400
Laura and Neil who volunteered to join

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,930
the team recently so they joined Naga

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:55,099
and Patty who were already in the team

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:58,470
so thanks for Neil thanks for Laura it's

00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:02,069
it's not very visible work that's very

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:07,440
useful for our community and to make

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:11,060
sure that some teams don't get inactive

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,799
I'll make I will make regular pins of

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,419
selected teams to make sure that is

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,979
everyone I mean there is someone

00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,979
replying to the questions

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:35,470
and during the word so what actually

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:39,100
yeah still so some numbers what what

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,050
we've been doing lately I don't know if

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:50,110
not if you've noticed but there is only

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:52,270
10 packages in the new queue yeah the

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,510
FTP team has been doing tremendous work

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:58,450
around that and they I deserve a thank

00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,220
big thank you and big applause I I mean

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,940
I think many people didn't expect that

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,880
and were not maybe didn't see that in

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,330
years and it's good to see it to see it

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,850
happen again it's very important to have

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,600
people active in the FTP team and the

00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:18,880
new queue is someone something that it's

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,830
just kind of flat last step so we are

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,140
doing all the work and now before

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,510
publishing it it's held in the new queue

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:30,220
until the review by the for legal stuff

00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:34,060
on the licensing and so alright it's

00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:37,540
awesome just have only ten packages we

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:42,580
also have 90% of packages which builds

00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:45,340
in reproducible way in testing 1964 so

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,500
given the age of the project for

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,050
producible bills it's like awesome work

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,080
I mean there are many people working in

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,000
that and they have awesome results so

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,540
they also deserve a bigger clothes

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,540
because the

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:09,730
so we are also welcoming 29 interns this

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,920
year for from outreach e and 25 from the

00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,530
google Summer of Code it also shows the

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:19,450
interest of people in our project and

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:21,820
the works that could be done and so

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:25,530
welcome if there are any in the in the

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,530
room or watching guess all those dreams

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,370
also about Jessie we've had the shortage

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:36,850
freeze

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:39,520
so only 170 one day is so we wanted

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,350
shorter but yeah it's still kind of

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,460
short it's like six months or something

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:47,380
and we I mean the release team is trying

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,930
to make it even shorter for the next

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,960
freeze and it's counting on all of you

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:56,950
to have a look of at your bugs and

00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,190
getting things fix it in time so that we

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:06,730
can enjoy developing things even more

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:11,160
for for Buster yeah so all those show

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:13,720
how what it's going on the in debian and

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,130
one question I wanted to think about

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:21,190
what is what made Debian successful

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:24,310
actually so I tried to summarize it in

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:27,880
four points the first one for me is the

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,190
large active community the work is done

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:35,500
by the community and only by volunteers

00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:39,640
and so all of that is thanks to them or

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,910
us second thing is about the quality and

00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:46,140
stability that's something that is well

00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:49,840
known for Debian and people are using it

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:52,450
also the largest package repository

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,150
it's one big selling point for Debian

00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:59,770
actually and people Ryan Ryan that to

00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,510
make that be in first to compile things

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,480
by themselves and having things

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:09,490
integrated and more one large repository

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:11,710
and the first point and maybe the more

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,020
important most important one is our

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:17,949
complete commitment to free software and

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,099
our project is documented in some in the

00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:23,830
DFS G and the green social contract and

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:29,159
also in our way in doing things we were

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,159
I heavily on volunteers and only and

00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:36,610
sorry and it's important to keep it that

00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:41,349
way

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:43,539
right so if you want Debian to be still

00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,550
relevant and successful in the future we

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,910
have to make sure that those points

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,790
still hold in the future

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:56,709
so I'm going to speak about the first

00:08:51,790 --> 00:09:00,820
three but the community and the package

00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:02,620
archive and my outline for the store

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,529
could be talking about the code of

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:09,760
conduct the Krejci assurance some

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:12,190
proposal for a roadmap trying to gather

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,120
ideas for how to fund new Debian

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:19,690
projects and finally I thought it would

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,649
be useful to to talk you about the DP

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:28,390
workload we had only one candidate last

00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:31,390
year and I hope to see more Conde dates

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:36,450
in the future it's it's an important

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:39,820
role in Debian past dpl's showed that

00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:42,149
many things can be made possible with

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,020
doubles with the DPL support and

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:50,260
commitment so it's very important to

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:55,600
have more people interested in that role

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:57,970
in Debian so the code of conduct it's a

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,170
document which clarifies our values and

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:05,230
principles it can be summarized in five

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:08,860
points very simple so it's by being

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,440
respectful having good faith being

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:16,899
collaborative trying to be concise and

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:21,310
being open may be the most complicated

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:23,410
one is it being concise we like the

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,850
details so writing long mails is

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:31,119
something we know to do

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:33,309
yeah and another important document is

00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:36,100
the Debian community guidelines which

00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:38,889
were was written by Enrico a few years

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,860
ago I don't know if some people heard

00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:46,749
about it in the past so by the way who

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:51,369
did read the code of conduct okay that's

00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:56,139
not still not 100% and we have to fix

00:10:51,369 --> 00:11:00,699
that some way so first if you have any

00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:02,949
issues we have to talk about it talk to

00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:05,050
them the harassment team approach the

00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:08,350
Debian account managers talk to people

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:12,189
next to you go to the front desk or get

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:16,059
me whatever but be sure that someone

00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:18,429
listens to you we want to provide a safe

00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:20,619
environment for our contributors we want

00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:22,329
I mean people are coming nowadays with

00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:24,639
their friends with our family with our

00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:26,199
children so it's very important to make

00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:31,360
sure that the environment is safe and

00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:36,100
people are still having fun so we have

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:40,300
so some procedures to get things secured

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:43,389
in some way so we still we we seem to be

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,730
going going doing fine on that point but

00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:49,809
there are still ways to enhance the

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,999
situation so first I think that we

00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,800
should make consequences of misconduct

00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:56,829
more explicit in the code of conduct

00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,519
it's kind of blurry but what you risk if

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:05,499
you are misbehaving like for example

00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:08,110
give some explicit examples in the what

00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:11,319
do you risk is very important to say

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,870
that if you are misbehaving seriously

00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:18,490
over time you risk to get your account

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:20,740
locked and getting out of the project

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,799
it's only it's not only about being

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:27,399
banned from mailing lists because for

00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:29,920
now the code of conduct says you be not

00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:35,339
be able to use the davines communication

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:39,429
systems but it should be more explicit

00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,190
also reminder about its existence some

00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:42,890
people didn't

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:46,070
we did I mean that's fine but we have to

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:49,240
fix it you have to read it and we have

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:55,010
to come in a communicative around the

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:58,490
code of conduct also so nowadays the

00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:02,180
code of conducts can be conducted can be

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:05,870
seen of some of our core documents which

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:09,230
defines our community our project so new

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:13,010
members when they apply to have a TV

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:15,590
account or a DM account can sign up for

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:18,170
the code of conduct just like other

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:21,770
documents like DVD and dmap and social

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:24,530
contract and it's something that is very

00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,120
easy to do and that way we make sure

00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:33,910
that people are aware of its existence

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,910
and its content so should be doing that

00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:49,640
so now about creative surance so we've

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:52,220
been packaging back stuff over time the

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,410
archive keeps growing and growing we are

00:13:52,220 --> 00:14:02,060
adding thousands of packages for each

00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:05,690
release so it's getting immense we used

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:09,350
to rely on unstable users to get the

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:12,650
archive tested and have you around them

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,450
to report our siblings and make sure

00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,810
that our see buggy packages don't make

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:21,230
it to testing but with this side of

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:24,380
archive manual testing is wrestle or

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,080
less relevant than it used to be and we

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:29,180
have to need find new ways to make sure

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,850
that the archive is still of a good

00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:37,910
quality so fortunately as we are some

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:41,180
piranha weed nerds about QA I guess we

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:45,440
have many tools so we have pupils

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,390
Jenkins dosia and other tools like we

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,070
are doing we put our producible bills we

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:53,840
have lint ian and doors are great but

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:59,420
they have to be integrated

00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:04,190
some way so see I appeared a few years

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:10,120
ago and we already have 20% of packages

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:14,230
covered by tests but those are not I

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:18,350
mean the effect of the tests being

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:22,340
passed or failing that don't affect the

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:24,680
archive for now we have other tools like

00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:28,390
the auto removals I don't know how many

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,830
of you realized how the auto removals

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,920
enhance the situation with respect to

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,000
the next to the number of RC bags but

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,850
it's kind of huge

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,960
it wasn't introduced it there so we see

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,730
the drop of packages

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,680
I mean RC bags which is so the Green

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,740
Line is for the next stable release so

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,800
it's for testing and it's well when it

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,590
was introduced half of them half of the

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,800
our siblings were just like of removed

00:15:54,590 --> 00:16:00,050
from testing it's not about hiding

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:04,930
problems but at least buggy packages are

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:08,120
not in testing anymore and this had -

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:11,060
quite a lot for Jesse release because

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,390
when we started we didn't start at like

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:16,370
1,000 RC bags we started with quite low

00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,850
number of our civics so we've done some

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:27,110
I can feel good here and then go to the

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:29,120
thing but I mean the archived fixed so

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,890
nowadays we have the big tracking system

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:37,400
at the heart of our workflow some tools

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:39,290
on the left side find new bags in the

00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,600
into the system

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:44,960
mainly manually today but it could be

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,620
automated in the future some tools are

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,770
lying of what the Beckster track

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:55,640
tracking system has to make sure that

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:58,330
the archive is not buggy so we have the

00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:03,370
auto removals we have also the Brittany

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,370
program which produces the testing suite

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:12,120
so we can imagine that in the future

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,980
CIA tests could prevent packages from

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,350
our getting to testing if there are

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,829
regressions or even if the test suite is

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:23,819
failing there are probably more things

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:25,790
to do so it's up to you to look for new

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:36,590
ways to test the quality of the archive

00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:40,440
and that's it's the road bad

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:44,790
so that's other subject I wanted to tell

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:47,550
you about there is no doubt about the

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,559
size of the project it's quite big there

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:53,370
are many teams and it's hard to keep up

00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:55,200
with what happens in Debian also

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:59,360
communication is not our thing strength

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,520
we don't all of them all of us don't

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,300
write blog posts about what we do about

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,750
what we are planning to do so it's hard

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,390
to every contributor to know what other

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,820
people are working on it's even harder

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:20,280
for our dumb streams which rely on what

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:23,700
we produce and also for users and not

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:27,470
non regular contributors so we should

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:34,800
find ways to promote our work and get it

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:39,660
understood by our users and this is not

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:43,610
a way to promote our work we it's a nice

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,610
way to see what happens in the archive

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:52,920
but it doesn't fail but otherwise it's

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,780
not very efficient so in the past we

00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:58,380
used to have the release guards which

00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,100
kind of promoted the plans we had for

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,260
the project

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:08,040
they were meant for the next release

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:10,559
were not our series blockers and their

00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,640
civility was rate too important to let

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:17,590
people do an amuse in timely manner

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:22,870
the thing is they were bound to the next

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:27,130
trees so as we are relying in volunteer

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:28,360
work it's not always easy to commit on a

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,270
deadline

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:34,950
which is okay which can be considered

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:37,600
kind of short of one year and health and

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,970
the released him at some point decided I

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,970
mean rightfully that they were not the

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,740
good body and Debian to decide on what

00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,500
should be a goal for Debian what should

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,710
not be good for them so they were

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:56,410
dropped and they have you announced the

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:58,780
announcement there but we can be what we

00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:01,830
can see right we have to document what

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:05,350
we want to do in the future and what we

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:07,660
want to enhance in the project there are

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,580
many things to do but people from also

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,520
the project are not aware of them

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,200
especially even people within the

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,070
project are not aware of all the things

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:22,090
that could be enhanced so we have to

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:26,490
promote that so a HOD map or correct

00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:29,140
like project goals or whatever just some

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:33,010
way to reveal the gap between what we

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:36,810
are now and where we should be doing

00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:39,940
what we should be like in the future

00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:43,300
it's a way to set priorities like

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:47,250
something in the roadmap is more has

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,250
more priority than something that is not

00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,450
we also like a way to set a vision for

00:20:52,540 --> 00:21:00,340
the project so that people know where we

00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:02,320
are heading what we're doing why and it

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,260
can be seen as a recruitment platform I

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,540
don't know if you have thought about

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:11,560
that but each time I try to recruit new

00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:13,900
contributors often they apply to me but

00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,640
I'm not interested in packaging but

00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,400
Debian is not only about packaging there

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:23,380
are many ways to contribute to Debian

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:26,500
and maybe with the roadmap when they

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,180
will see the for example application

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,170
porting

00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:33,300
for that be doing or application

00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:36,150
converted to new systems or whatever

00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:39,180
they'll be motivated to get things done

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,910
because it will be there will be like

00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:46,260
some kind of to-do list and it will be

00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:49,860
easier to understand where they can hang

00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:55,620
on the system so it's also a way to

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:59,880
motivate people when you're many on on

00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:02,580
the gold it's better than when you're is

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,280
related and sometimes we don't realize

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:12,240
that we are working all on the same goal

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:14,790
so that's a way to get the bigger

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,560
picture of the project and get things

00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:22,970
and get people focused on some goals we

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,820
could be doing that with smart criteria

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,650
it used to be smart bite I drug to DT

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:31,560
explicitly because we know how to do

00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:34,050
those we know how to specify a specific

00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:38,220
goal we know how to measure some goals

00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:41,370
if there are specific we know I mean we

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:45,360
kind of find volunteers for that work

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:48,150
usually and we have to make sure that

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,950
the goals are realistic and relevant so

00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,260
the odd man should be flexible if

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,060
something is not relevant anymore we

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,160
should be able to drop it from the list

00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:00,870
and if it sounds realistic there is

00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:05,700
maybe it's premature to add it to the

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:08,400
list yet and kept for the future so the

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,870
T was for the time girls should be

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:18,780
timely should we should set a deadline

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:22,500
but we can have troubles committing to a

00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:25,440
deadline so we can say for some okay

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,130
it's ready when it's ready I cannot

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,180
commit to a deadline but somehow someone

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,300
it will be ready

00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,610
what can we which we can do also is to

00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:39,510
say okay it will be ready next to

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,559
release just not now because it's big

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,480
work

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:48,059
not the next release but the one after

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:50,700
and that's something which sets some

00:23:48,059 --> 00:24:02,309
deadlines in the future which is still

00:23:50,700 --> 00:24:04,820
realistic so what the problem is not so

00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:07,860
it's not about the release girls because

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:10,409
girls shouldn't be necessarily bound to

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:14,249
release they should look after

00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:16,529
I mean unplanned for the future it's not

00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:19,019
a way to discourage individual

00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:19,889
individual initiative it's actually

00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:24,299
quite the contrary

00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:28,230
is to be sure that everyone's work gets

00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:32,009
the visibility that it deserves and by

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:34,230
putting them in the in the hot map you

00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:38,490
make sure also that it's you have ways

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:40,529
to attract new contributors and it's not

00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:43,200
only about packaging work there are

00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:45,240
other things that we can that we can do

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,749
in their project like for example we

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,480
could have goals on our infrastructure

00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:55,009
many things can be done there I'm sure

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,600
DSA has a lot of ideas I'm sure that

00:24:55,009 --> 00:25:00,509
everyone who is maintaining a service as

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,360
ideas were that and we should have ways

00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:10,769
to promote that work and get it more

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:14,309
visible so who can organize that one way

00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:17,509
it could be to say nobody because no one

00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:21,749
volunteers for the work and it's kind of

00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:25,110
big work we could say that it will be

00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:28,350
the DPL but I think it won't be

00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:32,309
sustainable and it's not maybe the best

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:37,110
place to do it it could be the Technical

00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:42,139
Committee because it is meant to give

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:42,139
advice with to developers and give some

00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:50,220
say it's like an advisory board so you

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,450
go to see them when you need an advice

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,629
and the roadmap is

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:58,480
exactly for that you have ideas you want

00:25:55,629 --> 00:26:01,600
to promote them and you want to make

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,809
hang on other projects in the in Debian

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,940
and it could be the body that in ensures

00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:08,940
that all the vision is coherent

00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:18,249
constitutionally it's also body that

00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:20,710
it's renewed every few years so we can

00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:25,149
make sure that it's not only a few sets

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:28,200
of set of persons that are defining what

00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:31,269
the project should be doing which is

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:39,869
important for me or we can imagine a new

00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:39,869
team even if we have many many teams my

00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:46,359
preferred solution is the third one

00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:49,470
obviously but that's something that

00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:54,669
should be discussed with the project

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:56,049
people should agree on it and the

00:26:54,669 --> 00:27:00,730
Technical Committee should agree on it

00:26:56,049 --> 00:27:03,879
before doing it then what you can

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:07,509
imagine as goals so I've listed some

00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:09,759
ideas I found mailing lists some people

00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:12,580
say that for producible builds okay it's

00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,980
it's big work we can pass but we can

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:17,109
focus on the base system at the first

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,739
step so get sure that essentially yes

00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:25,210
and required packages are producible and

00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:27,190
or maybe I heard yesterday that the

00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:31,869
first CD for installation could be made

00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:35,889
reproducible at least we could route get

00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:38,980
all demons provided I mean package to

00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:41,440
determine providing systemd files moving

00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,769
from the menu system to desktop files or

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,809
CIE blockers for testing migration and

00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:49,179
I'm sure there are many other ideas we

00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:52,090
can reuse the ideas that were published

00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:54,429
for the various goals for Jessie in the

00:27:52,090 --> 00:28:01,460
past all the ones that we didn't manage

00:27:54,429 --> 00:28:04,680
to finish in time so you will be

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,930
asked for what you want to do in the

00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:12,480
project and it's very important that

00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:14,220
everyone contributes to the list so the

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,260
odd map to summarize it's a way to

00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:21,690
promote our work it's many people from

00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,000
the outside of the project don't get the

00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,170
big picture and it's a way to tell them

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,510
what we're working on

00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:32,280
it's a way to share a common vision

00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:37,770
goals on the project and more reportedly

00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:41,790
it's we have to find a decision process

00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:45,690
to how to organize all that and work on

00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:48,030
them collectively all together and if

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:51,330
you are interested there is a buff

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:55,170
organized on Thursday where we'll be

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:59,940
discussing that so I hope everyone will

00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:04,740
join and to see you there that's all

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:12,750
about so now about funding Debian

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:15,630
projects we have some ways to spend the

00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:18,120
donated money so we are gonna using Deb

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,310
comes I mean events in general so there

00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,680
comes a mini dip comes and sprints etc

00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:27,900
we are also buying a hardware for

00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:29,490
developers to get things when done like

00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,430
for example when you have a driver to

00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:38,670
test it's a lot easier when you have the

00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:41,760
hardware for it accessible we also spend

00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:43,530
money on some infrastructure mainly the

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:49,230
domains and certificates was also some

00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:52,470
servers so that's how we actually spent

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:55,910
the money which is donated today we also

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:59,720
have other initiatives to extend the

00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:03,240
security support on our for our archives

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:06,030
and there are companies who contribute

00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,690
by hiring Debian contributors to get the

00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:12,330
work done there so what we can notice is

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,070
that that's some work that never been

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:18,420
covered by a volunteer work

00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:20,280
and it was very nice I mean I'm sure

00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,880
that security team appreciates the work

00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:26,220
that he's done by it yesterday because

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,910
everyone uses it companies are using

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:33,080
using it users are using it it allows

00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:38,030
them to keep their systems running for

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:41,400
longer but we have to detect other

00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:45,380
projects back in there I mean stuck and

00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:50,250
not done in Debian and they could be

00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:54,900
funded or we could think about it find

00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:58,110
new ways to get them done and likewise

00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:01,170
there is a buff on Friday on that so if

00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:06,630
you have ideas if you've seen projects

00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:09,750
that don't get I mean we like we've

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:14,220
spoken about like in four years ago and

00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:16,650
nobody stepped up to do it to do them we

00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:24,450
could try to think about how to get them

00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:27,090
done so every idea is welcome so finally

00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:32,780
about the DPL work and I'm thinking on a

00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:36,300
month time right yeah so I'll be quick

00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:44,120
how many requests do you think I get

00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:44,120
every week some number 500 ok a bit less

00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:52,590
then well it's actually 10 yeah

00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:55,410
that's only the requests so as you see

00:31:52,590 --> 00:32:00,750
here you have to reply to mails and

00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:03,840
start some discussion about I mean what

00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:08,220
it's requested so it could be a bit more

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,890
but it's not that massive it's not what

00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:14,790
people think about when we are speaking

00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:18,180
about the DPL workload we usually

00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:21,690
imagine thousands of males and flamers

00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:26,580
in private stuff etc but it's actually

00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:30,030
not the case it's going well how many of

00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:35,190
you did send a mail to leader during the

00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:40,910
past 12 months for example not that many

00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:43,890
maybe we have the ten requests here so

00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:46,830
what's about the daily tasks so you have

00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:49,200
the males you have to know I mean you

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:51,720
never know what people will ask you so

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,080
you have to be responsive and reactive

00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,510
you have to watch your mail you have to

00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,730
pay attention to team that might need

00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:02,730
you for example when we approach DEP

00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,730
cough people might need to do some

00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:09,090
expenses and you are usually usually the

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:14,130
last step before the action so if you

00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:18,510
don't reply in timely manner things get

00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:21,210
stuck and it's important for you to be

00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:23,280
reactive on that so there are some

00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,770
things about approving expenses and

00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,180
budgets and the communication part if

00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,920
you're doing things you have to

00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:32,490
communicate about it you have to be

00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:38,090
transparent so I had to I wanted to

00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:38,090
summarize what it's stilton like

00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:45,210
summarize what could make a big

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:48,780
difference in the job a DPL can do so

00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:50,690
it's about availability to reply to the

00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:54,290
requests and get them

00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:56,210
going forward it's about transparency if

00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,250
you're doing something you should not

00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:02,740
hide it because it's very important to

00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:06,290
communicate on our stuff it's also about

00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,150
communication and I put here imagination

00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:11,090
because when you have something like

00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:15,770
that in the Constitution you have to

00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:18,860
find ways to use it right and yeah

00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:22,490
it's a way to introduce some innovation

00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:26,750
and change in the project and that's

00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:32,080
actually what makers makes new things

00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:35,540
possible but actually the only address a

00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,910
power that a DPL can use to make the

00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:45,260
project doing new things and going

00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:52,490
forward yeah under you've finished just

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:55,520
three mind so if you feel confident

00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:59,180
about those please write a platform

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,820
starting from now talk to people come

00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:05,030
talk to me and nominate yourself for

00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:09,050
next DPL elections it's very important

00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:11,480
and you should be considering it and if

00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,920
you see people that you want to see I

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,860
mean if you know people that you want to

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:20,240
see are dpl's talk to them encourage

00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:22,460
them it's very important to get them the

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:27,590
feeling that they are needed and they

00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:32,500
could do good work on that so thank you

00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:32,500
for attention if you have questions

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,460
we have customer see ya one quick

00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:50,050
question from RC yeah has been preparing

00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,050
his questions yesterday so he's

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,430
recording yeah that's not a question

00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:02,810
regarding automated testing of Debian

00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,160
packages do you believe only packages in

00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:06,470
mind should be tested

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,930
was it packages in contrib non-free be

00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:11,240
tested for example at the moment only

00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,550
mine is tested by Sierra Debian dotnet

00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,560
using auto pkg test scripts in the

00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,990
defense learnings to be skipped should

00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:20,900
we limit our testing to packages in mind

00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:26,030
to spend our focus and resources on TF s

00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:29,960
g packages only okay it's also related

00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:33,200
on how we build stuff in the past we

00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,330
made sure that package is built for main

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:40,760
and on free are built on separate

00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:42,790
builders so that to get nothing's broken

00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:47,780
at some point because we never know what

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:49,460
non-free software contains I'm sure we I

00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,350
mean if you are providing something to

00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:57,590
our users we have to make sure that it's

00:36:51,350 --> 00:37:02,900
tested otherwise there is no it's not

00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:07,580
useful to do it so he should be talking

00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:10,250
to Antonio and three and see what how

00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,460
things could be organized we have

00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:15,080
another RFC question but let's get

00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,320
looking for your success so that you

00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,940
will not run again

00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:23,240
now I'm not like looking for a successor

00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:26,060
I'm looking for people to make the

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,720
voting period more interesting and to

00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,720
foster

00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:36,050
and to proceed I mean the exchange that

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:41,690
we could have during the complain

00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:46,070
because that's a way to get new ideas

00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:50,050
I mean expressed from unions to help you

00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:53,900
maybe sorry and for minions to help you

00:37:50,050 --> 00:38:00,170
well also yeah if you are interested and

00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:02,270
if you have ideas then another quick

00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:04,040
question from our see what do you see as

00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:07,460
the biggest challenge for the Debian

00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:11,390
project the biggest ginger challenge I

00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:14,330
think is to maintain 50 thousands of

00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:21,020
packages and we should be thankful to

00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:23,870
our on our contributors any other

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:30,730
question or should I stop suffering

00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:30,730
