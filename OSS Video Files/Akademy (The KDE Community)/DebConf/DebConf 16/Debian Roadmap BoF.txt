those of you saw Middies talk that's

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,370
from a DPL we'll have seen the slides we

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:12,599
mentioned what motivation road maps can

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,429
be so and also trying to find some ways

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,470
to actually get that growing and started

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,570
so this is what this buff is about I

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,640
have two mics we can pass them around

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,880
and up one foot passing run and one now

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,590
run around it so if you have a question

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,970
of something to say just be sure to read

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:33,390
you answer it we can get your question

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:35,670
on video as well thanks I have around

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,969
the room so the slides about the roadmap

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:46,850
or not if you didn't raise your hand

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:46,850
okay so I'm going to show them quickly

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:30,790
so it's so it was about to work on a

00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:34,630
document with the goals that we set for

00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:37,330
the project have a green decision

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,149
process on how to get inked on the

00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:44,289
roadmap and what's part of the element

00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:47,920
when it's not part on the roadmap it's

00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:51,070
similar to what we used to have the

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,950
release goals but they were bound to

00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:59,740
release and only cover the technical

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,179
aspect of the project in the odd map we

00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,800
could have ideas about the

00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:05,530
infrastructure but the documentation

00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,739
what organization about how to spend

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,050
money how whatever so it's not only

00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:14,860
technical aspects about packaging or

00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:19,780
getting stuff done in the archive so

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:24,160
what I so there is a road map document

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:28,620
in gobby yeah some people found it I've

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,620
put something some items on the agenda

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:37,239
so we are going to discuss first the so

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,329
nobody has a responsibility today on the

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:43,900
roadmap so at some point there is a

00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:47,110
delegation that should be done so that

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,989
the team in charge that will be able to

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:53,400
and have legitimacy to decide on the

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:58,590
content of the roadmap for that I put

00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:04,390
some ideas about the tasks of that team

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:07,239
then discuss which team should be in

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:12,579
charge of that is it an existing team

00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:16,120
will be a new calculate a new team to

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:19,959
take care of that and then get some

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,709
ideas from the the content the actual

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,610
content of the roadmap I shamelessly

00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,940
took what

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:31,060
was for the reefs gold so it's quite

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,210
about it was about smart it was about

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:37,870
finding an advocate for the idea and to

00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:40,060
make sure works is getting done it's not

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,260
useful to have something is if there is

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:47,350
no and pushing to get things implemented

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:51,330
and it was about having an idea which is

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:56,470
really where there is general consensus

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:58,840
otherwise we are not we were not asking

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,300
the team to design blindly on the things

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,190
they should be debate among developers

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:08,100
and enter the reach consensus and if not

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:12,520
the technical committee could decide

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,190
which side to take or which solution to

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:21,790
implement because that's their role

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:23,770
today so first one tasks so for me it

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,620
was about getting the proposals

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,740
reviewing them ensuring that there is

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:34,090
some coherency do not have conflicting

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,760
ideas or idea that overlap it was about

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,580
deciding about the content a roadmap so

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,440
after the review they make a proposal

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:48,990
for the project it's get it gets

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:51,910
published and that's all having

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,220
political reviews because at some point

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,280
maybe some ideas are not relevant

00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:01,260
anymore so you can drop them from the

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:05,250
odd map or get new things added and

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:10,960
measurement of the results was added by

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:16,690
maybe so for me it was the status get

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:19,630
all the progress so maybe we should it's

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,430
part of the review if you review

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:26,700
something you have to measure its

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:30,900
progress so look it has something to say

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,900
yeah it's above

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:52,139
it's supposed to be okay yeah

00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,629
so I have two different commands or

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,909
questions the first one is what's the

00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:59,580
positioning of this compared to tap the

00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:03,150
gentleman proposals maybe you can answer

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:08,539
this one I cannot be other one after so

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:12,240
for me the DEP is a tool to get things

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:21,479
documented and implement it could be the

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:23,849
same process but there is no one I mean

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,270
managing all the depths and getting

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:31,050
making sure that there are still active

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,909
advocates that there are still making

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:37,139
progress if they need something you're

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:42,409
not the abscess could can also be seen

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:49,529
as focused on the technical side which

00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:54,180
is not the whole point and also it's not

00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:57,629
convenient to show what current things

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,370
so we could have another document

00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:03,750
somewhere on the wiki for example to say

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:06,180
this is the roadmap for 2006 16 maybe

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,930
with links to depth but yeah depth could

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,550
be a way to implement the roadmap I

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:15,659
discussed yesterday a bit with some

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,729
about depths as well so basically depths

00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:21,080
are maybe too descriptive roadmap is a

00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:24,419
bit higher level maybe depth I a tool to

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,449
detail how we implement something in a

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:28,560
roadmap and try to build consensus and

00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:29,310
sometimes it can be also the other way

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,330
around

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:36,689
we we build the depth but it's not clear

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:39,180
if we have some conscientious so at that

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:41,580
point it might make sense to get back to

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,320
the Technical Committee to sort of see

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:49,420
whether it's good enough

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:52,240
not and you can be blessed some way in

00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,640
that case maybe can be included in the

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,480
roadmap or not it depends on the level

00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,760
of the depth so for the risk goes we

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:11,430
used to have a wiki page I can show you

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:19,180
an example so it all on the wiki for

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:21,610
example if we take something documented

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,900
so you have a description and then the

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:29,950
implementation details you have

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:33,370
advocates some contact point if there is

00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:36,880
one some status about the work that has

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:40,120
been done usually you can also find the

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,260
link to the BTS with the user tags if

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:47,140
people who filed bugs and take it them

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:54,790
properly so you can see the progress of

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:55,950
the goal so it could be as simple as

00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:02,430
that

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:06,840
especially different people do have

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:11,290
comments about this part or the task

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:14,410
yeah so I'm all for more communication

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:17,290
about all we want people want to improve

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:20,350
Debian and more documentation about that

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:23,050
I see the point in having a team in

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:27,580
charge of ensuring that the process

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:31,540
stays alive and that infrastructure to

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:34,600
measure progress etc I'm not so sure

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,590
about the fact that that team is to be

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,570
delegated it seems more to me like it

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,580
seems similar to meet the policy team

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,070
for example where people are just

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,550
helping document the state of things

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:53,140
rather than decide on the content of

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:55,000
what should up to a Technical Committee

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,570
that's the difference between policy and

00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,360
Technical Committee and so the one thing

00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:03,940
that is the one power that could be

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,140
dedicated is decide the content of the

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,970
roadmap but that's recursive like you

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,980
decide whether web map and then you

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,120
decide you delegate the poetry say

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:21,030
what's in it and I wonder if we

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:25,089
shouldn't think of first of what are the

00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:26,950
higher priority without the power that

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,750
it gives to get to be on the roadmap and

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,810
then decide if it should be a delegated

00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,300
team like if all what not that's what

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,839
you wrote at line 10 if or what not

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:43,570
Burke's

00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:46,180
our C's then we need a delegation right

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,810
so my proposal for this could be that

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,940
the team is in charge of like the

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,950
paperwork but the actual decision of

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,100
what's in their roadmap is taken by all

00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:01,480
the developers through voting so people

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:04,570
propose goals they get seconds for their

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,550
goals and then eventually we both which

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:15,220
of those goals we want and which goals

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:17,230
we don't want like a CR for the goals

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,750
and whichever goal it's on top of

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,880
further discussion it gets accepted and

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:29,800
whatever is below further discussion

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:34,720
doesn't get accepted that was my idea

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,910
I mean it's a way to see if people are

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,220
arguing with the idea there is some

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,620
consensus but I think we also can also

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:46,390
discuss that from meeting this and see

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:49,240
if a strong disagreement I'm not sure

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,490
that is we need we will need to make

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,110
votes on it I mean for the risk goals

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,529
for example in the past we didn't

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,720
two votes and there wasn't big fights

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:04,190
about what's a release going on what's

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:06,829
not so I don't expect it to be much

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,890
different from what these girls used to

00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:12,079
be there's there's a couple of release

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,610
girls out there that we have not

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,920
implemented yet than they have been like

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,839
they're for ten years right um so one of

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,660
the problems I think with this approach

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,660
that we've had was that you know sort of

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,269
define a goal with a deadline and then

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,279
find out that volunteers are probably

00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:30,560
just not going to be able to deliver in

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,360
time and then and then we had to sort of

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,750
like be flexible about how we interpret

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,089
the release go if we had the EPS with

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,310
owners or however you call that stuff

00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:43,399
and people responsible for driving the

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:46,640
process progress until it gets to a

00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:49,160
point where the committee or the Debian

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,500
project at large is ready to say yes

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,970
this is we will roll with this we will

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,120
take it and put it into the next release

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:59,000
then maybe motivation for the team

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,459
leaders or these little task leaders VP

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,760
owners and would be higher to actually

00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:08,209
drive consensus within the sub project

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,160
within the EP so that they they then

00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:12,170
meet the deadline you know it's not the

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,149
difference is let's not declare a

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,740
release goal in the beginning of the

00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:20,360
process and then fail to meet it let's

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,930
make it clear that whoever whichever

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,850
team around a DEP manages to have

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,300
something ready by the time that we need

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,850
to freeze is going to be included and

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,870
have it be more of a rolling process I

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,870
hope that's clear

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,130
I think what you're saying is we

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,070
shouldn't commit to things before

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:49,640
they're ready and if that's true then it

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:52,580
prevents us from being able to use a

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,740
tentative commitment to drive motivation

00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,470
to succeed at that commitment and apt

00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:03,080
that's actually like some if we were all

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:04,340
voting on them then I I'm sure there are

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,650
released goals that I could have helped

00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,510
with that I didn't know about but if I

00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,830
were confronted with them to vote on

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,600
them then I would have known about them

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:14,270
and I would have been more likely to

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,680
help with them and I'm not saying voting

00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,840
necessarily the only way to do that but

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,880
I like the I like some important

00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:25,130
publicity phase before something is done

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:31,750
or not Sam Hartman um

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:34,430
I think I'm all for a publicity phase

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:37,940
where people are trying to get support

00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,860
for cool goals I think I haven't

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,840
processed behind that well having ways

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,860
of doing that would be great but I think

00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,040
that should be well before the

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:48,020
commitment phase one of the lessons that

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,430
was kind of hard for me to learn that

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:54,920
the Anthony towns was was very good at

00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:58,280
beating into people when I first joined

00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,910
Debian you know over half its lifetime

00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:04,460
ago was that the people who do the work

00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,550
kind of do get to decide what work it's

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,320
done if you don't that basically Debian

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,290
is about a plot is about enabling people

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,270
to do work it's not about mandating what

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,970
work they will do and that's pretty

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:19,400
early in our Constitution and I get

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,660
really worried about committing to

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,060
things before they're ready because that

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:28,060
sounds a lot like telling people what

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:31,910
work they're supposed to be doing and I

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,410
I think Keith Packard was basically

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,620
talking about these go this goal setting

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:41,270
is a way to enable people to do work and

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:44,360
to coordinate um but it shouldn't be a

00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:46,250
stick to hit people with either to

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,350
discourage them from doing work that is

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,830
to say we shouldn't have anti goals and

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,120
it shouldn't be a way to force people

00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,589
into doing what you want them

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,640
to do because both of those things don't

00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:00,770
work very well in Debian yeah I had two

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,690
remarks about that so indeed it's not a

00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,270
way to discourage individual initiatives

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:09,250
it was actually part of the my slides

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:13,130
the only thing I find interesting

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,980
important actually for the team that

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,900
will be in charge is that so sometimes

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,930
you can have two proposals which are

00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:23,810
conflicting and we have to make sure

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,700
that all the items are coherent in the

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:30,320
way we are going to make things in

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:33,920
Debian so for now there is the technical

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,089
committee who I mean who handled the

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:42,170
complex so we can say we have a process

00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:45,050
to have that for the commitment time

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:48,980
commitment it's actually not very

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:50,930
important to say where it will be we can

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:56,740
say when it's ready like for the

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:59,600
releases what I see for the odd map is

00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:03,020
it's a way to promote someone's work and

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,040
by promoting it hopefully we can get

00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:09,740
more volunteers to get it done and

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:13,309
that's the most important part is make

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:16,309
them more visible in what they do in the

00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:19,250
project does that mean you you're

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:21,319
suggesting it should only be goals where

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,760
someone is already taking charge of the

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,280
work though or do you think we can also

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,949
have a road map item where no one's

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,140
doing it at the moment so these goals

00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:33,320
with inactive advocates in the past

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:36,230
didn't work with we we can have some

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,370
section with this something this is

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,370
something that should be done

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,150
yeah and then try to find volunteers to

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:52,560
do the work but it should be advertised

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:54,940
that as not active I'm not sure how I

00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,810
think very very strongly that we

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,120
shouldn't have

00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:01,360
we goals that people haven't signed up

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,480
to do work on because then it becomes a

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,470
wish list and I mean we might have very

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,910
good ideas or very bad ideas but it's we

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,970
need some people to actually do the work

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:19,870
and we can't and we don't want to force

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:23,710
people to do work if we don't promote

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:26,920
some ideas they won't be done any time

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:29,160
in the future maybe and we couldn't we

00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,440
could say that for example in act I mean

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,820
ideas with no advocates could be part of

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,010
the hot map for six months for example

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,230
for one year and if they stayed no

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:40,770
activity there we could drop them but at

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:46,300
least we tried to promote the idea and

00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:49,210
gather I think that should be a

00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,610
different different list basically I

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:55,890
don't think that we should have ideas

00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:58,270
well section another section in yellow

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,820
if you're looking for something to do

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,190
here's a suggested list that's fine but

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,290
it's not it doesn't necessarily enable

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,980
people to do the things we want to

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,960
enable by by giving them kind of the

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:18,400
mandate which I think our release call

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:21,280
or or an item on a roadmap implies well

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,020
I mean it can also become a kind of

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,520
precursor stage that if you think

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,020
something is amazing and should be on

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,020
the roadmap then it's your

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:32,640
responsibility to gather some people who

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,640
do have the knowledge to do that work

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,640
and then the roadmap team's role can be

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,530
to make sure that you're thinking

00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,670
carefully about who you should be

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,930
collaborating with in case you're

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,610
forgetting people I think that's the

00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,560
part that I find most exciting that

00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,720
there's some that there is it there

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:53,250
could be a team that if I sort of say

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,250
hey I think that

00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:58,240
I don't know I think that all of our

00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,770
foods should bar then they say oh that's

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,190
great make sure you talk to this person

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:04,360
who also does a foo and I'm then I make

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:09,250
sure that I'm collaborating with the

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:11,200
right people early on I like to second

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:15,400
that idea I think one of the most

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:20,770
important things that a team can do here

00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:23,200
is to avoid late conflict so it really

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,310
is incredibly frustrating when you have

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,550
some great idea

00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:29,260
and you you you're moving forward and

00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,630
there's a lot of momentum and you've

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,630
talked to nine of the 10 teams you were

00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,880
supposed to and team number tens like no

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:40,570
not in a million years I will never do

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,210
that and instead it's it's great to get

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:45,670
them involved to have some people who

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:51,310
help you get them involved early enough

00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:52,870
in the process and basically once you

00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,320
have enough advocates and stuff to be

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:58,630
able to answer questions like so if we

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,340
were going to make Debian a better

00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,910
operating system for containerized

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:06,430
software how would we go about it would

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,520
this be a reasonable way rather than

00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,570
getting 90% of the way done and

00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,730
understand then discovering oh no

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,770
someone who's in the critical path won't

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,450
won't support it and I understand that

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,850
sometimes the answer is well we don't

00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,860
know you can only answer this would this

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,720
be a reasonable way not necessarily is

00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,950
this the way we would choose because we

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,410
don't normally you know we don't really

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:29,620
let multiple options flourish in

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:32,050
parallel for a certain phase but at

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,630
least learning the people who are going

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:38,970
to be hard cells early you can really

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,970
avoid a stop energy being injected

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,040
yeah I was just looking if there

00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:53,059
questions on Irish yeah if someone can

00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:59,220
write a bet and tell us could be great

00:21:53,059 --> 00:22:03,090
so I guess we kind of agree on the idea

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:06,059
of the tasks there is no disagreement I

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:09,120
mean about it

00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:11,870
so for the RISM goals we used to raise

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,790
automatically the severity to important

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:18,690
that allowed in the past people to make

00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:20,700
to easily muse so it doesn't conflict

00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:26,070
with the race teams perimeter because

00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:31,050
that's about arsonists or not the

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:33,330
question is should be keeping it I guess

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,429
the only the question is also how this

00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:38,610
works in practice I mean if we say we it

00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:40,470
doesn't necessarily make sense to remove

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,420
lots of packages because they haven't

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:46,140
yet got a new feature that is in the

00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,120
roadmap well I don't know what other

00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,370
people think but I mean if it's if it's

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,500
if it's not contradict there's a

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:57,360
question of there could be bugs that are

00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,620
our requests but wish list basically but

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,050
they're removing the package won't

00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:10,670
actually further the goal so removing

00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:13,410
the package because I'm personally Lori

00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:15,650
focus your fridge for removing packages

00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,510
because

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:20,130
but imagine our roadmap features and

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,410
everything must be able to communicate

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,990
by carrier pigeon and we haven't yet

00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,490
implemented this in LibreOffice it

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,410
doesn't to me make sense to remove

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,100
Liebherr office because I wish this by

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,100
asking for it

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:43,960
the severity is important it's not

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:46,000
release critical so yeah it does well

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,280
and still stay is the release team

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,080
jurisdiction to decide what to actually

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,820
release and if we have a release code

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,480
that says we want city one to be

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:58,000
entirely reproducible its it's their

00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,860
call to wait or not wait until this

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,830
wishful thing we might want to achieve

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:06,040
at the end of the day is a cheat or not

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:07,840
so I consider the the severity box

00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:12,910
ability quite a bit a detail of this

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,440
discussion really well not really

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,110
actually because in the past it was

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,400
really helping people three I mean doing

00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:30,250
the release goals to make things that

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:37,210
easily done in the archive yeah about

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:42,940
that but what I would like to see is a

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:45,130
more extensive list of higher powers

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,960
that be you know being a really cool

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:52,000
gift but sample one thing that could be

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:55,150
done is get FTP masters to prioritize

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,850
new processing for packages related to a

00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:59,800
release goal that does not need to be

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,000
done for each and everybody's goal but

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,480
for some of them it could be really

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,559
relevant to a faster new processing and

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:16,050
that's a way to provide incentive for

00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:18,340
setting up so again I'm not really

00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,559
convinced that the important wishlist

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,830
thing either makes sense because this is

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,929
the enemy policy it's fairly liberal you

00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,850
can just enter new things with fifteen

00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:30,850
ten eight days delay which is generally

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:33,970
enough for almost everything so for me

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,860
the the main deciding features for the

00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,650
non-saucy or not and it's gonna be

00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:41,490
staying in nan RC so it's not really a

00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,490
big deal for me at least

00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,230
No

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:21,030
that's it okay

00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:21,030
at least we asked the question sorry

00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:29,320
until he finished the sentence so he

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:32,220
everyone has to go back anyway some of

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:36,580
the question is which team could should

00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:38,920
get this organized my idea for now was

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:42,880
the Technical Committee because in the

00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,950
Constitution so the membership is

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:50,400
limited in time so they had a renewed

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:52,960
the team members so you don't have

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,350
people taking away the roadmap for a

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,020
specific set of developers with some

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:04,900
view it gets renewed and ensures that

00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:11,590
it's it remains neutral it's actually

00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:15,580
also the body in invariant to resolve

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:20,110
conflicts between developers and offers

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:24,760
advice so for me it's the best con

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:26,800
debate for now and I'm not for creating

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:32,410
new teams because I think we have too

00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:34,030
many og are there some comments on it

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,720
what's the position of the critic

00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,720
Technical Committee

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,380
well technically the technical company

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,730
hasn't taken any decision on that so I

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,919
cannot say what the Technical Committee

00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,679
opinion is what I can say is my own

00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,260
opinion is that I can see the value of

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,200
having the TC being that buddy the only

00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:00,080
thing I worry about is having the other

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:06,190
appeal court that the TC is for the rest

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:08,419
of the problems that said that kind of

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,029
everything looks like it could be done

00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:12,740
by not any other team or motivated

00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:16,370
members that would be setting up tools

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:19,250
and having a nice process for that it's

00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:22,549
just wishful thinking that we can find

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:28,580
people to do that or I'd be thrilled to

00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:30,289
discovered it it is not so the Technical

00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,789
Committee could be the fallback but I

00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:34,340
don't think it's a good fallback I had

00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:36,080
kind of the same opinion about having

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,770
the TC being that they've been policy

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,500
maintainer

00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,330
that's more of a last resort idea and if

00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,100
we don't find anyone else to do that job

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:46,490
then the TC might be the one to do it

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:49,090
but it would be a better place if it

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,090
were not the case

00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:58,279
about the policy because it was the last

00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:01,010
point so in the Constitution you already

00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:03,620
decided on technical policy so you don't

00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:05,360
have to maintain the package I mean

00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,779
technically but you could decide whether

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,049
there was some disagreement on some

00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:17,169
points so it's not about getting

00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:17,169
technical work on the package I guess

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,380
for what map is not really for black I

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:30,020
mean it's really the first one when you

00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:33,950
have conflicting ideas and when you have

00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:36,890
to get some compromise or consensus or

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:39,140
some solution decided or whatever if you

00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:42,929
have another team which is hot which

00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:46,210
handles that they still have to

00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:50,830
go see and go to the Technical Committee

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:52,450
to get it resolved in some way so having

00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,029
a technical committee in charge of the

00:29:52,450 --> 00:30:01,600
whole map is also a way to get the

00:29:55,029 --> 00:30:04,120
process faster well then maybe we

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,529
disagree on the on how the actual

00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,529
process of the roadmap would look like

00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:10,120
and your what I understand from what

00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:11,919
you're saying is that you assumed that

00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,110
there would be a lot of arbitration

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,570
which I think might not be the case most

00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:24,130
of the things we can put in the roadmap

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:27,159
are 98% of the time non-conflicting yeah

00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,630
right yeah if it's true that most of the

00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,429
roadmap items are non-conflicting which

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,070
is what I was going to say also then it

00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:41,260
seems that the purpose of the roadmap

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:44,409
team would be to serve as like to be to

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,360
provide motivation or to provide like -

00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:49,059
I don't help people think through their

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,549
ideas but it then it the road map team

00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:53,529
in my view a different vision of the

00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,240
road map team if you assume for now

00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:57,460
hypothetically there are zero conflicts

00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:02,919
is the let me help you do what you want

00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:05,350
team where you you you know if I come up

00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,019
go to the let me do it I want team and I

00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,820
say hey I really want to change

00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:15,519
permissions on farm ale

00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:17,289
and sure we can eventually I'll have to

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,760
make a path to policy or whatever and

00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:20,169
get the tech committee to agree but I

00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,370
first need to figure out who in the

00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,980
project actually cares about the

00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:25,510
permissions of our mail then they let me

00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,970
help you do it I want team will say okay

00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,919
so you need to talk to these IMAP D

00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,870
maintainer x' and postfix maintainer and

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,039
exit maintainer and even the same

00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,169
malleability hater I'll be like right

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,730
thanks I forgot about send mail and that

00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:41,309
is a success of the let me help you do

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:45,309
it I want team and so I think that

00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:46,929
hopefully and so if you have people in

00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:49,120
tech committee who sort of signed up to

00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:50,799
help arbitrate then that is sort of an

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,419
anti negative perspective that is like

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,950
how do I help this suck the least and

00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:55,010
that my is that is a very different

00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,650
mindset from the mind

00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:00,140
how do I explore the whole list of

00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,630
everything going on in Debian to hand

00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:05,570
you more work to do to people to contact

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,730
and I'm not responsible I'm just helping

00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,870
you figure out what you need to do so in

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,280
that sense I think that there's

00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,940
different reasons you get involved with

00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,580
one or the other

00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,410
yeah I was actually trying to see the

00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:19,220
Technical Committee with new positive

00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:22,549
tasks instead of someone but if they

00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,750
don't want that it's I mean I think

00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:25,549
they'll just push someone into the

00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,320
Technical Committee on the promise of it

00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:29,059
being a job where you had to have

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,470
responsiveness of one week and about an

00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:41,450
hour a week whereas this might be a

00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:44,330
rather higher work um I think it's very

00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:47,090
important that I would like to see the

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,980
Technical Committee BC received and move

00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,929
towards a mode where we are moving

00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,910
things forward in a positive rather the

00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:53,179
way then rather than an anti negative

00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:58,700
way

00:32:53,179 --> 00:33:02,960
I do think that the Technical Committee

00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,520
can do some of the do what to help me

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,000
find the right people to talk to you

00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:10,240
work we probably have good skills in

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,429
that regard but I do think that

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,400
ultimately you're gonna have to do a

00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:19,419
fair amount of work up front of getting

00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:23,450
substantial energy behind your goal

00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:27,890
before you can claim any large project

00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:33,070
resource for review just to make

00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:35,299
workloads manageable okay

00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:38,210
the most important question actually

00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:41,540
about the team is are there some

00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:49,030
volunteers further let me help you to do

00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:49,030
what you want deal thank you

00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:56,429
yeah that's the second program actually

00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,530
I would volunteer so long there are many

00:33:56,429 --> 00:34:01,200
other people involved so maybe let me

00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:03,059
put it this way yeah like if you're

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,250
willing to possibly volunteer for that

00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:07,020
raise your hand this is not a commitment

00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:12,349
just curious if anyone else finds that

00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:15,119
idea interesting okay let me just wow

00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:16,349
yeah yeah yeah yeah really really keep

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,250
your hands up and let him take the name

00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:21,629
I'm not kidding

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:23,310
like it's just he's writing down the

00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:25,200
names you're not know it's really thing

00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:27,270
I mean so that you can discuss people

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,300
with that about their commitment to get

00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:33,570
that done and it's very important to not

00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,490
sorry

00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:38,220
what's the qualification to be on the

00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:41,460
team was the question you don't

00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:44,399
necessarily have to be very technical it

00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,200
should cover all what we do in Debian so

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,540
in that way it's very important to have

00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,580
a diverse team not focused on the

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:54,450
technical aspects so everyone is welcome

00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:58,170
even non-reporting duties even DMS even

00:34:54,450 --> 00:35:01,740
done DD's so yeah if you want to

00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:04,369
volunteer John Solomon had his hand up

00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,810
to just say you have that on the West

00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:14,010
anytime

00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:16,880
just who is realist your name is Kate

00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,880
right yeah

00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:25,530
as unfortunate as it might sound for

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,930
your grand plans this kind of looks like

00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,550
the project that we should have some

00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:33,630
sort of attempt out there and then

00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:36,540
iterate and trying to get the whole road

00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:37,950
across the whole thing in going directly

00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,420
saying the Technical Committee is in

00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,859
charge of arbitrating between the

00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,820
project and having a very complex

00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:47,220
process about that seems like too early

00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,780
for that and if we have a team of some

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,540
people that are ready to announce a

00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,930
quick quickly quickie thingy that we

00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:57,060
have on the wiki saying these are the

00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:59,100
constraints we want to have for roadmap

00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,800
items and we start with that and then if

00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,630
in six months we have a dozen of them

00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,820
then someone will come up with some

00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:09,840
system to make that more manageable and

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:12,000
if in six months we have nothing then so

00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,030
I thought what's your point exactly my

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,940
point exactly as that was I think it

00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:22,410
just needs to be tried that's what we

00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:24,060
are here all right I mean and okay the

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,740
second half of my phone is that it just

00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,840
needs to be tried with a team of people

00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:33,210
but that happened to be motivated and

00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:37,170
then we can rediscover exactly our so

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,790
how are we going to do oh we could start

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,020
by grating it creating a mailing list

00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:45,060
and start discussing how to make things

00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,680
how I mean making good call for

00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,109
proposals for example get things

00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,630
reviewed on some wiki page and then make

00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:55,080
someone else meet this first set of

00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:58,350
proposals and yeah I don't imagine

00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:02,070
something complicated I mean really my

00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:04,170
problem with these teams of front well

00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:08,490
who's going to decide is this really

00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:11,010
sane because if we only go okay you have

00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:12,330
a nice line here why not I don't

00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,050
understand what you are a is match looks

00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,910
good

00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:23,950
does it make sense

00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:27,250
so yes it's a good topic about the

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:30,309
Technical Committee is that it's a body

00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:36,640
so if they sign up for something you

00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:38,920
have few chances of appeal you rather

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,700
sure that you can go forward without

00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,490
having other people coming there are two

00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:47,829
points if there is or of consensus of

00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,569
the on the idea they should mean

00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:51,309
shouldn't be any need to go to the

00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:53,710
Technical Committee to decide on on it

00:37:51,309 --> 00:38:01,200
so it should be pretty straight choice

00:37:53,710 --> 00:38:11,049
straightforward and then well as did you

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:13,720
commented I have my other say I had the

00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:19,270
feeling that they see themselves of a

00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:22,150
court to decide on problems so it

00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:26,650
doesn't match when I exit for the

00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:28,329
roadmap maybe we drive them towards

00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:30,789
other people in Devon that could be

00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:33,910
interested and then we invite them to

00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:37,420
present the results to in dependable

00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:39,400
give two weeks troll comments and well

00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,630
if there are no objections then we

00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:48,099
validate otherwise we maybe seek some

00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:50,079
advice from the Technical Committee like

00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:52,569
every developers I mean that you can

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,119
still have make comments so I don't

00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:57,430
think it's just ready to bind the

00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,180
process to some team and wait for the

00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:03,039
comment if there is somebody what a

00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:08,140
great impact by a project and he has a

00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:10,180
few negative reactions is somewhat he

00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,490
wonders should I quietly not quite I

00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:16,750
think it's still good I think I did not

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:21,260
understand my point or maybe some other

00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:23,180
bad words but maybe they can

00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,760
you can have people against for various

00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,110
reasons and sometimes it's a good reason

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,050
to stop it sometimes it's not a good

00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:34,580
reason to stop yeah sure but as my I

00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:36,500
said I think earlier I think we know not

00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:39,620
much conflicts on the release goals and

00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,240
so if there is some conflict we could we

00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,360
could say okay it's not part of this

00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,950
what map of this year but the decision

00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:54,650
will be delayed for this specific point

00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:56,720
and yes usually for more policy related

00:39:54,650 --> 00:40:00,950
goals I mean for example I try to drive

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,110
depth 14 on the get layout I think I

00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:05,240
have a broad consensus around it

00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:07,750
may you still have a few people who say

00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:10,130
well this is useless

00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:13,750
because what matters it won't throw blah

00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:17,030
blah blah and if they're only concerned

00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:19,910
concern is about uselessness I think

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:23,630
it's okay yeah but it'd be nice to be

00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:25,970
able to I mean at that driver I'm not so

00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:30,290
confident yet to say to move it to the

00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:33,710
accepted state so maybe she could help

00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:35,420
here well I guess and maybe a part of

00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,220
the question is if the Technical

00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:40,130
Committee is the kind of quarter appeal

00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:43,010
then who makes an initial decision is

00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:45,230
that just a kind of consensus of a list

00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,760
or do we need any do we need or not any

00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,690
more formal way to make the initial

00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:53,450
decision amongst people that's why I

00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:55,610
mentioned the delegation initially for

00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,800
me it makes sense to make the delegate

00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:00,740
delegate embody what's technically

00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,110
material as the port of advice and then

00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:06,200
we could just clearly our case you could

00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:08,750
we could just do so the let me help you

00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,730
team could just recommend to the goal

00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,400
owner that you should go to Technical

00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,050
Committee and ask for advice about

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:21,920
whether it's an acceptable state or not

00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:23,810
I just I think that if you view the

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,150
Technical Committee as a Court of Appeal

00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:28,070
and that's how you approach it you will

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,930
regret that decision

00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:41,339
for a very long time

00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:45,839
I don't think people say like yeah yeah

00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:47,430
sure that's why I mean I proposed to

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,650
Technical Committee to take that

00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:52,380
insurance because I think they have real

00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,960
value on that and they showed that they

00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:59,490
know how to discuss with people who

00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,140
reached consensus excetera yeah there's

00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:04,020
the one global thing I think we should

00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:06,359
keep in mind is that it's quite unusual

00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,279
for the project to rely on having

00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:10,410
someone external say this is the good

00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:12,869
thing you should do it and having the

00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:15,390
technical committee vouch for all the

00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:18,930
things that are the roadmap kind of

00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:20,460
changes this too if I want to do

00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:24,390
something in Devon I need to have

00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:27,210
someone say it is okay and that's where

00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:29,960
I would much much more like something

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:33,539
where a team of motivated people's

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,930
prepare an initial road map ish that is

00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:38,549
good enough and then for things that

00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:40,799
that are controversial then we should

00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:42,720
have a white project quiet discussion

00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:45,089
anyway and if it's still very

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,980
controversial and very important then at

00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:49,500
that point you can have an external body

00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,510
say okay well we spend some time

00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,880
thinking about it and it's important

00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:56,910
enough so that we rule that it is on the

00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,950
roadmap but being having having the TC

00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:02,940
agreement on all the roadmap items as

00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:06,589
default sounds kind of scary to me in a

00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:09,750
nutshell before finishing if you have a

00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:12,510
deep disagreement on some goals so

00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:16,140
obviously it's not a project goal so

00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:17,849
there is no doubt that that item

00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,670
shouldn't be part of the odd map yet

00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:23,160
until somewhere consistency is reached

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:27,539
so it's up to anyone to comment on the

00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:31,470
ideas and say why it's important or why

00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:35,089
we shouldn't be doing it yeah

00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:40,289
so I think we are running out of time

00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:42,830
it's midday so the other section was

00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:47,050
about proposing ideas for the road map

00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,050
can do it later in the global document

00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:57,620
yeah other words questions okay anyway

00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:00,940
we're running at the time hey so thanks

00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:04,490
for being here we will stay in touch

00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:09,130
there will be some announcements soon I

00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:09,130
