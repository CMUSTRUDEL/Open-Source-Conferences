professional open-source ready astronomy

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,350
by Jason Manley yeah thanks very much so

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,200
I think I've made a bit of a blasphemous

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,599
move bringing my Mac here today but uh

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,790
the other seven computers that I run

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,390
will run Debian or Debian derivatives so

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,980
I don't feel like I'm in bad company and

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,170
I've managed to convert my parents as

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,449
well so it's it's looking pretty good I

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,519
think so I'm here to talk about Radio

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,609
Astronomy today the talk is gonna be

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,289
kept pretty kind of informal and not

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,090
very technical it's kind of a high-level

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,239
overview and just kind of give you a

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,350
flavor so lots of pictures and things

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,180
this is what we're talking about so

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,120
we're building these big dishes they

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,739
look like giant satellite TV dishes this

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,390
is actually a picture of meerkat one of

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,250
our that the array that we currently

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,570
building out in the Karoo and we don't

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,829
just build one of these things we're

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,750
building an array of them so that's a

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,739
picture taken a very recently on our

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,449
site and meerkat has about 64 of these

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,969
things there they're about 13 and a half

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:06,060
meters across and the whole thing is

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,400
based on a very flexible reprogrammable

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,220
software-defined radio that's all

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,260
open-source there's about two pips per

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,540
second of processing capacity in there

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,700
it doesn't sound very high compared to

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,040
today's supercomputers but we're only

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,770
burning 26 kilowatts to do that it's

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,950
very power efficient and we're very we

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,600
dominated by IO for two perhaps a second

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,820
we've got 15 terabytes per second of

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,040
data being exchanged and that drives us

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,150
into towards building sort of custom

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,759
hardware rather than buying

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,740
off-the-shelf things interestingly we do

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,299
direct digitization so there's no analog

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,850
down conversion those of you familiar

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,670
with Radio Astronomy and sort of analog

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,320
radio and it will be the world's most

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,250
sensitive l-band instrument when we

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,750
finished building it next year so why

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,340
are we building this thing well it's

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,439
kind of a flagship project for the

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,729
country we want to show off our our

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,049
capability as it were

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,869
so we we're building this world-class

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,670
telescope but we also want to attract

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,439
and retain scientists and engineers a

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,420
large part of our project is human

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,599
capital development we invest about a

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,780
third of our budgets into students we

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,890
found about 400 students at university

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,780
and so we want to inspire

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,380
a new generation to sort of pursue

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,000
careers in science and engineering we

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,030
also try to stimulate the local economy

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,640
so we use local industry wherever

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,500
possible to build this thing and it's

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,700
actually a pathfinder for a future

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,850
telescope called the Square Kilometre

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,850
Array that's coming that will be built

00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,140
throughout the world and those of you

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,760
follow these sorts of things in the news

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,590
may have heard of this announcement a

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,360
couple of years back we won the right to

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,640
host the Square Kilometre Array on our

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,209
site right next to meerkat so that's

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,140
what we're working towards and the site

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,560
where we're building this thing is

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,970
protected we have legislation in place

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,580
that prevents you from putting radio

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,140
transmitters up there RFI is a very big

00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,700
concern it's radio frequency

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,010
interference you can't come near us with

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,510
a cellphone or to a radio anything and

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,900
I'll try and explain a little bit about

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,390
that in a minute and we're we talking

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,920
about there's a map of our country there

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:16,440
and there's a section towards the

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,440
Northwest that sort of almost circled in

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,120
blue for those of you following online

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,160
and that is the protected region of our

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,700
country this is a map of population

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,200
density down here in Cape Town in the

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,570
sort of bottom left corner there it's

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,860
red it's very densely populated but out

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,410
in the northern cape we'll be building

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,329
this thing the color is grey and that's

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,459
not - two people per square kilometre

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:39,930
and I say people but actually I think

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,720
it's just sheep there's like nothing out

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,760
there and that's very important because

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,700
we don't want people polluting the radio

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,350
spectrum it looks something like this

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,570
mostly rocks and kind of scrub

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,570
vegetation it's it's a semi desert

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,040
region and there are these little Hills

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,170
that actually provide a bit of shielding

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,630
from terrestrial transmitters that are a

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,549
few hundred kilometres away so it's kind

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,810
of the ideal place to build this and

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,410
they're very few places in the world

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,640
that offer this kind of environment so

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,200
this is one of the arrays that's

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,730
currently on our site and if you zoom

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,850
out a little bit you'll see seven of

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,190
these things standing there but we hope

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:20,250
by 2020 it might look something more

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,700
like this if if we start building the

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,410
Square Kilometre Array there and in fact

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,849
these dishes would not just be based in

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,690
South Africa they'd be spread out

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,760
through through

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,040
at the continent all the way up to Ghana

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,740
so we have lots of other countries

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,050
involved in this as well

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:41,190
now Radio Astronomy has a fairly long

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,180
history or rather astronomy does radio

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,820
astronomy is much shorter

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,120
called Jansky discovered the first radio

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,490
waves from space in 1929 but grote

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,930
Arriba in 1937 was the first person to

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,470
actually build a telescope for the

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,750
purposes of of listening to signals from

00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,120
space Jansky sort of stumbled across

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,240
them while trying to solve the problem

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,590
of radio telephone calls cross the

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,830
Atlantic and he discovered this

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,600
interfering source coming from space so

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,660
we can sort of happened upon this

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,730
science but you'll see this dition on

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,410
the right looks remarkably similar to

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,680
the way we build dishes now and that was

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,840
the first one ever done so the basics

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,090
have been pretty much the same ever

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,740
since it started in the early days

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,330
things were pretty simple you you built

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,580
the dish as big as possible to make it

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,620
as sensitive as possible the processing

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,880
was all done in analog and the computing

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,710
backend was a guy with the pen and

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,419
pencil the problem with this sort of

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,370
approach is you can only build these

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,530
things so big so you sort of run into a

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,240
sensitivity problem eventually and the

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,919
largest fully steerable telescope in the

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,010
world is the Green Bank telescope it's

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,590
about 100 metres across weighs 7,000 300

00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,720
tons to kind of put this in perspective

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,150
imagine picking up a football stadium

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,780
and turning it around at the sky that

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,120
that's the size of these things and in

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,010
fact that it's it's it's a problem

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
because the thing weighs so much when

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,820
you move it around its own weight

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,130
deforms the surface so you have little

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,220
motors that actively correct for the

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,480
surface deformation but what happens if

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,520
that's not big enough you still want it

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,470
more sensitive well you have to build it

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,450
into the ground so if you've ever

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,360
watched that James Bond fans you've seen

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,770
Goldeneye might recognize this it

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,100
doesn't fall with water and there's not

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:31,290
a bad easily under there but it is kind

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,280
of a spectacular bit of engineering and

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:37,830
this was in 1960 this is 300 metres

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,870
across and at the moment is a bigger one

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,430
under construction in China called fast

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,470
that one's 500 meters

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,840
and they reckon they're gonna finish it

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,450
by 2017 so today it's pretty far along

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,340
already but when you get to these sorts

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,470
of scales there are all sorts of

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,540
limitations you sort of pointed straight

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,010
up at the sky you can move the focal

00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,870
point around a little bit so you can

00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,220
steer it a little bit but you can't look

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,770
at anything you want you kind of have to

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,130
wait for the earth to rotate back around

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:07,980
to see that thing again

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,750
and also the bigger you go the narrower

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,700
your beam gets on the sky so you see a

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,110
smaller part of the sky so if you want

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,630
to do a survey if you're looking for

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,780
something it takes you a lot longer to

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,850
do that now why are we trying to build

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,130
these things so big and the reason is to

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,990
try and collect more energy to sort of

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,180
try and put this in perspective imagine

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,330
100 watt light bulb that you turn on and

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:35,280
off so on for a second you burn about 28

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:39,900
million hours of energy if we run 26

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,310
meter dish and we look at the brightest

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:46,080
source in the southern hemisphere Virgo

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:48,360
a 12 hours every night for 10 years you

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,340
only collect a thousandth of that energy

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,880
so these things are really really

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,580
sensitive the signals that we're trying

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,200
to detect are really really weak what

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,440
happens if you put a baby monitor on the

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,540
moon could we detect that not only can

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,080
we detect it but it's 10 times brighter

00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,550
than the brightest source we observe so

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,620
if you walk next to one of these dishes

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,750
with a cellphone you blow them up and

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,750
they're really expensive so we don't let

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,100
people on sight with cellphones so

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,400
rather than trying to build these things

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,990
bigger we build more of them and so the

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,170
start of this was sort of the Very Large

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,060
Array 1980 this one's still very popular

00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:31,250
if you've seen the movie contact you

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:35,160
might recognize this so these are I

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:37,710
think 20 odd meter dishes and they're 20

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,290
out of them something they're abouts and

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:42,300
the kind of fundamentals of this is you

00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,070
can imagine a source up there somewhere

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,170
in space and there's signals coming down

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,490
from it and they arrive on the surface

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,560
and these dishes are in slightly

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,900
different positions and the signal hits

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,580
them it's likely different times so what

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,290
we trying to measure is that delay and

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,880
then you can work out where in the sky

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,320
the sauce was sort of the basic concept

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,730
so in South Africa we kind of new to

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,759
this field we haven't been doing this

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,829
very long and so we we've gone through a

00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,180
few different designs to get towards

00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:11,490
this meerkat array that we're building

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,709
we started out with an experimental

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,630
development model which was just a

00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:17,220
single antenna and then we went to cat

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,949
seven that's seven of these things

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,449
that's been running since about 2010 and

00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,699
now we're busy building me a cat and

00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:25,279
those of you at the shop I might notice

00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:27,420
that these things look subtly different

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,399
the first two on the left or what we

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,380
call prime focus there are legs

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,480
supporting a field structure in the

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,319
middle of it but Mia CAD is what's

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:41,940
called a Gregorian offset and the reason

00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:44,339
for this is to avoid any thing sitting

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,930
between the sky and your dish so these

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,660
lines are a little bit fainter with the

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,970
lights on but essentially the signal

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,279
comes into this main reflector this big

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,339
dish here and then bounces off to a sub

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,779
reflector and then hits the receiver and

00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:00,779
there's nothing sitting in the aperture

00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:05,910
of this main reflector so you get a very

00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:07,440
clean signal no multipathing and this is

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,880
a stepping stone towards this big

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,160
international project called the Square

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,260
Kilometre Array which is sort of

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,329
consists of three parts this dense

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,560
aperture array thing some dishes like

00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:17,910
these pictures you've been seeing and

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,519
then something called sparse aperture

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,319
rays and the sparse aperture rays are

00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,970
going to be built in Australia but the

00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:27,389
dense aperture rays and dishes are

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,709
coming to Africa and they might look

00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:30,000
something like this these are artist

00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:33,569
impressions of course these are the

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,430
dishes you can have lots of them dense

00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:37,860
aperture rays looks sort of like these

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,959
tiles that are on the ground and the

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,490
sparse aperture rays are sort of dipole

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:46,769
staring at the sky now the focus of this

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,920
talk is sort of on the the processing

00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:52,380
side of this my role in in the slightest

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,759
is the initial upfront signal processing

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,060
of these systems which is now all

00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,500
digital in the early days of digital

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,259
instrumentation it was done with

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,689
discrete logic that's 74 series ICS and

00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:06,689
they were actually still in use up until

00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:08,370
just a few few years ago so you know

00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:10,400
over a 30 year lifespan that these

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,530
things ran

00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,030
so you build these these cards with all

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,650
the logic on and then you kind of stack

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,360
them in in these racks and you've got a

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,640
roomful of these things too to build a

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,990
correlate of the size and the current

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,650
state of the art is to do this using

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:27,360
Asics so this is the evla it's an

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,390
upgraded version of that Very Large

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,460
Array in New Mexico and you basically

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,590
take a PCB build them as big as you can

00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,810
some of them are 2 meters square and

00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,150
just pack them with Asics and you slot

00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,560
them into these big chassis cabinets and

00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,270
you put lots and lots of cabinets in the

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,400
room and you kind of connect them all

00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:48,570
with ribbon cables and hope you haven't

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,710
missed wide something and a lot of

00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,120
people ask me well can't you just do

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,160
this with software now I mean that's a

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,080
74 series logic in their 80s you know

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,090
surely by now we can just put an Intel

00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,920
CPU there and we're done and it turns

00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:02,100
out you kind of can you can replace the

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:06,090
less old 74 series logic with about 153

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,890
gigahertz CPUs and today is sort of

00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,480
cutting edge correlators both using

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,180
those Asics we need something like two

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,030
hundred thousand CPUs so these systems

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,890
are pretty big we crunch big numbers and

00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:19,290
you can you can improve this by using

00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,120
accelerators like you know GPUs or cell

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:24,420
processors or whatever the flavor of the

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,700
month is but these things all pretty

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,860
power-hungry and it's difficult to get

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,990
the data into these devices and

00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,220
computers aren't really good for high

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:37,320
bandwidth applications so when we came

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,630
to building cat 7 which was deployed in

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,580
2010 we sort of started with a bit of a

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,660
clean sheet and we said okay there are

00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,460
all these other ways of doing these

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,740
things if we were to do it now from

00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,270
scratch given our current technology how

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:53,640
can we do this what's the best way to go

00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:57,000
about it and one of the concepts was to

00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,680
have kind of a building blocks that you

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,360
can use if you will you can kind of

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,710
couple these building blocks together to

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,540
build different types of instruments

00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:08,330
because you do different science with

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:10,470
these telescopes and to scale the system

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,350
dynamically as it were by just adding

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,090
more and more hardware so you could

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,290
build pocket spectrometers and channel

00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,610
eise's and all sorts of different things

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,110
all out of these same building blocks

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,300
just by sort of connecting them up

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,930
differently and when you run out of

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,700
space on one board while you can

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,710
connect multiple boards together and

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,790
when you aren't able to connect multiple

00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,410
boards together anymore

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,910
you can plug them all into a big network

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,240
switch and just sort of keep scaling

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:37,170
this thing out and so we came up with a

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,000
sort of concept diagram where we have

00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,740
dishes here on the Left plugged into

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,240
something called f engines it's it's

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,010
sort of a it's a channel Iser

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,060
and then it goes into a big network

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,570
switch and then you have a whole bunch

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,610
of processing nodes hanging off this and

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,529
it turns out we weren't the only ones

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,450
thinking along these lines the

00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:57,250
collaboration for astronomy signal

00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,640
processing and electronics research or

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,589
Kaspar which started at UC Berkeley

00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,420
tried to create the kind of PC of Radio

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:05,860
Astronomy so the idea is to sort of

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,720
accelerate and streamline the

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,529
development of these instruments which

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,270
can take over 10 years sometimes and in

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,890
so doing sort of better track Moore's

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,920
Law you know we want to use low-cost

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,149
commodity Hardware you want to use you

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,620
don't want to have to redevelop the

00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,810
system every time you upgrade it you

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,800
want to reuse what you can so can't you

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,440
come up with some sort of platform

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,150
independent DSP library you want to use

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,529
standard communication protocols that

00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:33,220
it's easy to interface with other

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:35,440
equipments and the idea is to sort of

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,240
develop those quickly deploy it late and

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,200
upgrade it often much more you know

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,320
similar to what you would do with a

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,209
laptop and critically if we can get lots

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,860
of people behind us then the

00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:46,420
non-recoverable engineering cost would

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,830
be really low and you can share it

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,330
across the community whatever you

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,310
develop whatever I developed we can

00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,130
share it and if we develop different

00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:57,760
things then we both gain you know what

00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:59,650
the other person's done so traditionally

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,480
as I say it takes over five years to

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,130
develop one of these instruments to put

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,290
this in perspective Casper's been really

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,560
successful in their first two years they

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,880
built eight instruments and the cost is

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,950
a whole lot lower than these things

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,920
normally would be it's normally tens of

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,390
millions of dollars and these Institute

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,400
as public instruments are typically

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,440
under a million so we use something

00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,850
called a Simulink environment that's the

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,070
programming environment for these things

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,680
it's actually graphics based some of

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,600
your link is a math works MATLAB sort of

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,910
add-on and it's the only non free part

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,589
of our tool flow at the moment but you

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,880
kind of drag and drop these modules out

00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:35,860
of a library and you connect them up

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,710
with little arrows and you hit a compile

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,630
button

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:41,960
and this was pretty novel when we

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,540
started doing this sort of circa 2008

00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,990
2009 but now it's fairly common and this

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,360
map in the bottom right here shows the

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:53,540
collaborators at the Casper workshops um

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,550
a few years ago so we use these

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,529
open-source hardware platforms this was

00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,330
sort of the first generation one this

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:01,459
was called the b2 which stands for

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,690
Berkeley emulation engine the sport was

00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:08,060
actually designed to simulate multi-core

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:09,200
processors so Microsoft and Intel were

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,630
some of the big customers for these

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,420
boards and back then it had incredible

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,490
specs 24 gigs of memory and 180 gigabits

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,640
of i/o it sounded amazing now it's like

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,649
yeah whatever but the problem with that

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,080
thing was there was no way to get analog

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,690
signals into it so you couldn't digitize

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,920
your antenna data so then they built

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,050
this other thing called the internet

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,270
breakout board whose sole purpose it was

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,850
us to digitize signals get it into the

00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:38,930
b-2s for processing and that worked well

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:41,209
enough but we thought my animations

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,029
weren't working so well sorry so we came

00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:47,270
up with something called the roach and

00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:48,650
in America Roach means marijuana that's

00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,060
not what this means this stands for

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,550
reconfigurable open architecture

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,950
computing hardware and it was kind of

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,390
the one platform to rule them all

00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,490
enrolled in the functions of the I Bob

00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,959
and the b2 into a single platform you

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:04,100
could digitize signals with us you could

00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,990
do your processing on here and this has

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,740
been really successful we we sort of

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,300
designed this thing for cat 7 but we

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,010
open sourced it and it's now in use

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,600
throughout the world most radio

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:18,100
astronomy facilities have one of these

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:21,740
boards in their pipeline somewhere

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,870
typically we use the biggest FPGA device

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,339
available at the time that's a field

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,350
programmable gate array for those of you

00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,270
not familiar with it the kind of idea is

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,970
it's like a CPU that you can rewire the

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,679
innards of so you can implement your

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,980
algorithms in hardware rather than in

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,170
software so we have this sort of big

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,800
FPGA device and then we put a lot of

00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:44,179
memory on it and lots of i/o and then

00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,200
there's a little Co processor on these

00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:49,550
boards as well that runs Debian

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,050
and it has some out-of-band hardware

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,240
monitoring you know there's predate side

00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,370
racks and things and we tried to keep it

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,380
backwards and forwards compatible so we

00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,450
use Ethernet communication standard it's

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,740
been around for you know 20 30 years and

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,480
we think it's we hope it's gonna be

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,900
around for another 20-30 years because I

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,580
telescope has to last thirty years so

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,780
you build us you kind of take this one

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,010
building block and then you stick a

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,420
whole bunch of them in a rack and wire

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,980
them all up together in a network and

00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,220
you get a cluster of these things as you

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,680
do in ordinary computers and it seems to

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,690
work pretty well so then we bought the

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,540
second-generation board called roche -

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,520
not very original and it's just sort of

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,640
bigger better faster and unfortunately

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,370
also more expensive and these boards

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,240
have become sort of the Caspar de facto

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,140
standard building blocks and then when

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,390
it came to build the third-generation

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,070
board which you'd think the next

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,840
generation will be called Roche 3 it's

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:46,130
not it's called scarab but it's the same

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,140
thing and we're a real Abel debt to sort

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,420
of bring it in line with the upcoming

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,460
ska array we wanted ska in the name

00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,430
somewhere but it's the same thing bigger

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,780
better faster version and it looks

00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,310
something like this those of you who are

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,430
yay yesterday afternoon may have seen

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:05,050
the demo I was giving this is just a

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:08,180
slide showing sort of some of the

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:09,800
capabilities of the board I guess the

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,100
only thing to kind of highlight here is

00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,800
even the roach - that is some you know

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,480
many years old now already had memory

00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,000
bandwidths of over 200 gigabits per

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,740
second which was many factors over what

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,080
was available in typical computers at

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,480
the time and these things that I use all

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,860
over at GMR Teen India and the ATA in

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,570
the States and there's a whole bunch of

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:33,530
other arrays coming online that would

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:35,060
could also be using this stuff and we

00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,650
kind of have some strange requirements

00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,470
these things operate out in the desert

00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:42,860
they stand alone so you know they have

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,280
to run remotely very reliably we have to

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,020
design a system to cope with failures

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,810
and we need to design it with the long

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,040
lifetime in mind so no single hardware

00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,660
platform is going to last 30 years

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,880
you're going to have to at some point

00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,230
service it an upgrade its and know how

00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,610
do you go about doing that you have to

00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,560
pick your hardware and software very

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,520
carefully

00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,260
this is what the development environment

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,040
looks like it's not your average

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,900
text-based IDE but you kind of have

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,970
blocks representing different things in

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,880
the system some of these represents IO

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,680
parts ad seas and decks and things some

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,870
of them represent signal processing

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,880
tasks and then you kind of wire it all

00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,550
together and hit compile and it programs

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,260
your board and runs your function so we

00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,970
have a pretty big DSP library we do

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,120
digital down converters fast Fourier

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:31,010
transforms polyphase filter banks

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,240
multiply and accumulates data reorders

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,700
all sorts of things all the typical

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,320
radio astronomy building blocks and we

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,630
try to make these things configurable so

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,910
it's it's a library of components that

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:43,070
you can adjust parameters on and it will

00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,720
consume more or less Hardware resources

00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,610
depending on what you do or what you're

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,660
trying to do you can tweak things like

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,040
the amount of bandwidth that you're

00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,690
processing if it's real or complex

00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,480
numbers how many streams you want to

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:55,160
process in parallel tweak bit widths and

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,180
so on most of the stuff we do is is

00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,250
integer it's a not floating-point and

00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,840
this has worked really well for us

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,240
instead of taking years to develop these

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,220
systems we built a addition monitoring

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,900
system in a month built an RFI

00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,230
monitoring spectrometer the same one I

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,430
was showing off yesterday in one week

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,830
and it took us six months to build the

00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,150
cat seven car later a whole lot less

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,560
than the ten years people were

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:23,090
estimating and this is kind of the first

00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:28,250
sort of science that came out of cat

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:30,500
seven we ran it through a standard set

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,570
of observations and compared it to

00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,850
existing known observations to see if

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,100
the system actually worked and the

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,700
results looked pretty similar it was

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,650
quite good

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,810
that was one dish and then we first

00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,430
connected two dishes we've tried to see

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,750
if we could measure this time difference

00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,460
and you get something called fringes

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:52,580
this is the wrapping of the phase of the

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,920
difference in the two signals and then

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,600
when we had a whole bunch of these

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,900
antennas together the first four we

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,790
tried to make an image and we managed to

00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,220
that was what the image looked like with

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,780
a single dish and with multiple you can

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,130
actually zoom in on that piece and you

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,630
can see that they're actually two things

00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:12,840
well you would if the like weren't

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,070
shining on the board and then

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,740
we tried to do a little bit of science

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,770
with it and it turns out we could do

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,270
science from about 1982 so we weren't

00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:24,330
quite where we needed to be but it

00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:26,330
demonstrated that the system worked and

00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:30,299
you could you could actually pick out

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:33,299
individual parts of always was 1977 so

00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:35,490
we were not quite cutting-edge yet but

00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:38,279
that's kind of where meerkat comes in

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:41,850
so meerkat is the sort of final

00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,500
telescope that our government is funding

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,770
it's our last step towards the Square

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,230
Kilometre Array and we learnt a lot from

00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:51,240
the XDM and cat seven and we've

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,039
implemented all of these fixes in in

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,299
meerkats this will be the world's best

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:59,100
telescope we digitized at the feed now

00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,929
so the dishes are no longer analog

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,970
they're digital they bring back Ethernet

00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:05,640
data straight from there so the analog

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,740
paths have been kept really short and

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,289
that gives you much better fidelity in

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,789
your data and this time domain data

00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,320
comes straight into a giant network

00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:15,450
switch and we hang off a whole bunch of

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,299
processes and those could be Roch threes

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,740
or scarabs or any CPU or GPU or whatever

00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,840
other processor you want anything you

00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:26,460
can plug into a network switch you can

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:28,020
use to process this data and what's

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,630
interesting is the switch in the middle

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:33,809
is multicast so you can now have

00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:36,419
multiple devices processing the same set

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:39,299
of data so you can have multiple science

00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:45,419
projects running at the same time that

00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:47,220
will be a world-first I can't go into

00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,470
too much detail for meerkat because I'm

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,120
kind of under gag orders those of you

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,549
interested in this should keep an eye on

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,460
the papers in two weeks time there's

00:23:53,549 --> 00:24:01,399
going to be a really big announcement

00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:06,899
that's about all I can say I'm afraid no

00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:08,159
nothing like that we we have not

00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:10,230
finished building meerkats

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,679
so only the first 16 antennas are in

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,440
place so there's not that much we can do

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,130
with with 16 antennas but there's

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,570
already been some new stuff there

00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,490
someone asked me yesterday about how do

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,950
we time these things and the answer is

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,520
with hydrogen mazes so timing is

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,780
critical

00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,460
the thing we're trying to determine is

00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,490
the different time of arrival of the

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:36,240
signals of the various dishes so we we

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,770
have very accurate clocks to do that and

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,360
as I say all the stuffs open the

00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,210
hardware the software everything there

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,480
are about 150 repositories at our github

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:50,190
account lots of software projects some

00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,500
hardware projects so the CAD designs

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,380
you know schematics PCB layouts

00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,570
everything is is in here if you want to

00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,420
make your own Hardware all the

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:03,150
supporting software is there as well so

00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:10,170
that's kind of the overview yeah there's

00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:16,230
some time for questions great talk so

00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:18,390
yeah I think you so the switch that you

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:23,370
have there is that a commercial switch

00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:25,830
or do you do it no its commercial we

00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,480
kind of would prefer to just buy

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,760
everything off the shelf if we could to

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,350
be honest and the only reason we go and

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,390
develop this custom hard way is just

00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,550
because we can't find any other products

00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,410
out there that can do what we want so

00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,270
that's why we sort of developed that but

00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,640
in terms of switches and you know the

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,080
computers that monitor the network and

00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,160
control these things it's all

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,720
off-the-shelf stuff wherever we can

00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,400
I'm very curious about your digitizer

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,050
architecture you said your direct

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,820
digitizing at l-band and yet your

00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,880
sampling frequency looks like it's below

00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:00,660
Nyquist for that band what are you doing

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,710
I'm just curious yes and what's the

00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,410
bandwidth I guess is the other

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,540
interesting question so meerkats

00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:08,730
digitizes 856 megahertz at l-band

00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,370
they're four different bands is UHF

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:13,050
l-band expand expand expand is the

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:16,050
widest one that's kind of six gigas

00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,160
gigahertz bandwidth so with Nyquist

00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,950
what's important is not the highest

00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:23,190
operating frequency but the bandwidth so

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:30,590
a ton 56 megahertz band you sample at

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:30,590
1712 megahertz any other questions

00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:39,000
thank you for an on radio astronomer

00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,670
what's the like what's the what do you

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,980
lose when you move from a very big dish

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,240
of a certain size to multiple little

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,370
dishes I mean I realize there's the

00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,570
practical that you cannot get that new

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:53,730
you need that but do you lose relative

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:58,320
resolution or it's a good question and I

00:26:53,730 --> 00:27:00,420
should have covered that the the answer

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,660
is you're trading off mechanical cost

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,640
for electrical cost essentially with an

00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,170
array you have to multiply every

00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,050
baseline a baseline is a pair of

00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,460
antennas so it's an order N squared

00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,680
processing problem so to build a small

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,360
array of seven dishes is trivial to

00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,220
build an array of 64 starts becoming

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,600
interesting to build an array like

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,160
Square Kilometre Array with thousands of

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,190
dishes at the moment it looks pretty

00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,210
impossible we think we can do it but

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,850
it's a really hard problem

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,470
it will generate more data than the

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,290
entire internet combined something like

00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:34,560
50 times over that we have to process in

00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,880
real time so it's a proper challenge and

00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,440
the data streaming there's no dead time

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,070
you can't record it and then go off and

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,290
turn on it later but what you gain is

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,090
being able to observe a bigger part of

00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,400
the sky because if you make a single big

00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:50,550
dish the beam narrows with lots of

00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,770
little dishes the beam is quite wide but

00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,280
the cost is more electronics to process

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,280
the signal

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:08,129
yeah hi

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,970
maybe you can explain a bit about the

00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:14,519
openness of the data so meerkat has a

00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:19,409
vision we would like to make all of the

00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:21,240
data available to anyone and everyone so

00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:23,070
the idea is there will be a web portal

00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,990
and you can kind of see the last six

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,210
months of observations and you click on

00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,440
one of them and ask you what format do

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,210
you want to download it in and it will

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,399
even do on-the-fly conversion to put it

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,600
in the appropriate package for you and

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,649
you can then sip and turn on it's on

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,119
your laptop if you want yeah I might be

00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:41,460
a bit of a tough task given the data

00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,779
rate but you know if you if you're at a

00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,090
university or something and you've got

00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:46,679
access to a big cluster you could do

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,919
science and we'll give you the data for

00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,919
free

00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,950
they'll be broken up into chunks maybe

00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:59,600
20 minute observations or something so

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:05,100
yeah maybe a bit smaller

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:07,889
yeah yes you said that you couldn't use

00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,149
any cellphones or radios near the the

00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:10,710
actual antennas so what do you use

00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:13,440
on-site to communicate with your teams

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,570
it's a real problem actually in many

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,549
ways we're our own worst enemy so we

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,499
have little metal boxes with IP phones

00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:21,749
in them with fibre going in there so you

00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:24,749
can you know like telephone booths back

00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:27,419
in the day for emergency communications

00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:29,519
they're two-way radios and we've we've

00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:31,289
we've selected the radios to operate at

00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:35,220
a frequency that's outside of our band

00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:36,840
but even so just having them there is a

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,509
problem and you can't do science while

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,279
someone's talking on it you know to try

00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:42,840
and put this in perspective there's a

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,119
there's a great picture outside Green

00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,320
Bank where they they show the signal

00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,820
coming in and then there's all this

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,740
garbage and then the signal carries on

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,970
and on when you're on the tour you kind

00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,740
of say what is this blip here what

00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,269
happened at all when screwy and say oh

00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,379
that's when some tourist turned on their

00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:59,999
digital camera so you you you you really

00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,200
have to be careful and it's it's the

00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,879
reason why we're out there in the middle

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,980
of no way it's to discourage people from

00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:09,280
doing things like that but the computers

00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,050
you used to

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,750
to do all this that's Sheila now how's

00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:16,480
that working it's buried underground in

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:21,360
a bunkered facility three you know James

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:24,700
bond-like there's not the questionnaire

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,320
the FPGAs what do you like about them

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,760
and what would you change about them

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,560
because presumably the FPGA is the

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,080
commercial FPGA so just general-purpose

00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,690
what would you like so they do lots of

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,340
different families of FPGAs you know

00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,170
they might have one that has lots of i/o

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,350
and that's targeting kind of the

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:44,830
networking market so scone these big

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,960
guys use a lot of those FPGAs then they

00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,820
have other kinds of FPGAs that are DSP

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,410
targeted those are the ones we use so

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:54,490
doing a lot of digital signal processing

00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:56,530
and the ratios of the sort of primitives

00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,880
inside they are different so they might

00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:01,870
have a little bit more memory in there

00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:06,250
and some more multiply multipliers but

00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:07,840
less IO for example and historically

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:11,710
we've always just gone for the biggest

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,690
one that had everything but they're also

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,290
starting to run into this problem that

00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,970
the GPU guys hit a few years ago where

00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,590
you're now limited by kind of how much

00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,790
heat you can get off the chip and how

00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:26,440
big physically you can make the packages

00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,880
so we're starting to run into this issue

00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,890
where we were having to trade one thing

00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,680
off for another we can't just have the

00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:35,110
biggest and most of everything and so

00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,870
now we have to select kind of the FPGA

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:39,910
very very carefully it turns out that

00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:42,700
they still a good mix for us you know

00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:44,800
obviously DSP is a big target market for

00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,050
these guys the military also use it a

00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,600
lot for radar systems and kind of

00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,730
tracking stations and things and their

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,150
application computationally is very

00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:59,020
similar to ours so we use parts that are

00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,800
designed for that kind of thing are

00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,980
there any more questions

00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,980
yeah

00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:07,820
so you've got a custom hardware platform

00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:10,369
and you're talking about these things

00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:13,449
being around for thirty-plus design your

00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:15,949
life how do you keep up with the change

00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:19,249
your favorite FPGA is going to be

00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:19,879
obsolete next month and stephy repeat

00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:22,509
that for most of the other

00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:26,179
semiconductors that is absolutely true

00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:28,070
and it's it's a problem that the other

00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:30,259
telescope facilities have solved by

00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,549
buying a lifetime supply of all the

00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:35,509
parts and just keeping it a big

00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:38,679
storeroom we don't like that it's it's a

00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:42,019
valid approach but it's very expensive

00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:45,859
so what we're trying to do and time will

00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:47,869
tell if this works is keep sort of

00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:50,239
industry standard interfaces with the

00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:52,669
idea to replace that what we call line

00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:54,589
replaceable units so you know we talking

00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:56,839
about Roche one Roche to Scarab boards

00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:58,429
today in 10 years time it could be

00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:59,719
something completely different but as

00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:00,079
long as you can still plug it into the

00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:02,419
network

00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,419
and still compile the design for that

00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:07,429
platform theory it's the same thing so

00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:08,839
if my laptop fails today you know I'm

00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:10,129
not going to buy this model or buy a

00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:12,529
different model but if you can run all

00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:14,779
the same software in our minds that's

00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:17,239
the same thing if you can still accept

00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:22,690
the data throwing it report it's the

00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:22,690
same thing so that that's the vision

00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,470
your last comment made me remind made me

00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,420
remember a medical imaging processing

00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,160
company which will remain nameless it

00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,100
has these clinical trials that go on for

00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,750
5 10 15 plus years yeah but found out

00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,520
that a lot of the software and a lot of

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,440
bugs happen we're turned out to be

00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,240
machine dependent and architecture

00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,550
dependent which is unfortunate but

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,740
apparently happens and so when they try

00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:58,810
to change to a newer generation of

00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,270
things if you were to try and reproduce

00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:03,640
the software analysis turns out you get

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:08,170
different results so I don't know if it

00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:09,670
will affect you or yeah sort of checked

00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:13,420
it oh your results are actually

00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:15,160
consistent across ten years we were the

00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:17,020
first telescope facility to do something

00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:20,520
called system engineering it's a it's a

00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:24,490
very robust kind of process to validate

00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:26,140
your system it's a lot of military

00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:30,280
institutions use the same kind of

00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:32,020
approach that gets us part way the other

00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,610
way we're trying to deal with that is by

00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,900
open sourcing all of this we have a lot

00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,850
of other people around the world using

00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:39,040
it sometimes on different hardware

00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:41,620
platforms and sometimes in very

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,390
different systems and they uncover bugs

00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,780
you know no one's perfect they're bugs

00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:48,730
in things but the hope is that by

00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:51,930
diversifying as much as possible you

00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,930
will uncover these things more quickly

00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:06,290
okay so who is using you the tools you

00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:10,750
are developing at the toka source tools

00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,750
is the authoring other Institute's or

00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,369
them as well

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,930
you know I tackled the top professional

00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:20,090
Radio Astronomy because one of these

00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,369
boards typically cost around 10,000 u.s.

00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,170
they're pretty pricey so for an amateur

00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:27,680
astronomer to get a hold of that and

00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:30,590
start using it is hard at most it can't

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,910
afford it but most of the big radio

00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,770
telescope facilities around the world

00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:36,710
have one of these boards somewhere in

00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:38,720
their system now and and and so they use

00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,070
these tools and you know if you're going

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,290
to ask me to name some of them now I

00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,490
probably could but I just embarrassed

00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,780
myself because I'll leave someone off

00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,530
the list and they'll be unhappy with me

00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:50,690
but they're probably about five or six

00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:53,930
dozen institutions around the world

00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:56,660
using them now with various generations

00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:58,580
of the hardware in you know that have

00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,250
been deployed a lot of the big

00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:04,010
universities also use them in the States

00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,960
they you know students play on these

00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:09,109
things and develop algorithms and things

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,089
on them so it's even started to be used

00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:12,970
a little bit outside of radio astronomy

00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:15,290
so the boards are pretty generic and

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:19,880
they're very cheap compared to other

00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:22,990
fpga boards like this hi thank you I

00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:28,730
just like to know you growing a pool of

00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:30,680
talent and intellectual skills etc where

00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,260
you sourcing people from and who you

00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,830
cross pollinating with know we have

00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:39,320
people moving on to from from you that's

00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:41,119
a good question so as I say about a

00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,570
third of our budget goes into developing

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,849
people we can't employ all of them so we

00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:50,839
found about 400 students our engineering

00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:53,080
officers only employ about 200 so a lot

00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:55,760
of those students go into other fields

00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,130
and we're not very picky about the sort

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,170
of students we fund in terms of what

00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,640
they research obviously we'd prefer for

00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:05,330
them to research something related to us

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,460
but we we would fund students doing any

00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:09,950
science and you know technology some

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,030
sort of engineering based projects so

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,140
some of them work in completely

00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,030
different fields

00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,710
that's okay as long as people are

00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:18,730
learning and excited about the stuff we

00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,730
feel we doing our job

00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:32,370
though any more questions I also don't

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,450
see any questions from IRC so let's

00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,450
