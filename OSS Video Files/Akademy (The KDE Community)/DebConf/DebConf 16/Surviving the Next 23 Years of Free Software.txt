[Applause]

00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,900
get that microphone wasted away

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:15,210
is there another microphone that's off

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:21,289
now okay okay that was on great that was

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,289
a a fitting introduction to my talk

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:32,510
which is about sort of stewardship and

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:35,130
and and what to do in our community as

00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:39,960
we we deal with some of realities of

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:42,000
life so I spoke yesterday and I think

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,219
many of you were cured so I won't I do

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,629
my my full in show again but I am

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,190
executive director of the software

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,500
freedom Conservancy which is the

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,449
nonprofit home of a lot of fantastic

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,190
grant from source software projects and

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,770
also the home of the Debian copyright

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,800
aggregation project I'm a lawyer but I

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,859
only do pro bono work now to fall into

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,210
your work and my clients includes the

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,100
free software foundation of a genome

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,650
foundation I

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,270
co-organized ret with Debian

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,040
participates in which is an internship

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,290
program for women and other

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,850
underrepresented groups in free and open

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:20,600
source software super into free software

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:23,850
and I'm a cyborg because I have a

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,979
defibrillator that has proprietary

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,720
software in it that is literally sewn

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,390
into my body and screwed into my heart

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,049
and for which I cannot review the source

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,509
code and it is insane these are this is

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,000
slide with all of conservancies project

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,250
many of which you're hopefully familiar

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,630
with

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:47,770
so the

00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:51,729
obviously first disclaimer for for talk

00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:53,860
like fixes that while I am a lawyer this

00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:55,840
is not legal advice and I am NOT your

00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,689
particular lawyer

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,700
it's you'd be surprised how often people

00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:08,080
get confused about that and just wanted

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:10,300
to point that out and it's my my status

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,890
as a cyborg has had me thinking a lot

00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:17,200
about issues around sort of making sure

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,950
that initiatives survive beyond the

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,420
individuals that started them and that

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,930
communities are healthy and thrive and

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,690
it's been interesting confronting my own

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,850
mortality while being a part of such a

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:35,530
full of vibrant community that is

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:37,360
developing and an aging too so the good

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,680
news first right like happy birthday

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,340
debian 23 years amazing I think that's

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:50,799
in in April is the anniversary of their

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:52,540
release how many people were like how

00:02:50,799 --> 00:03:00,040
many people remember their release of

00:02:52,540 --> 00:03:07,359
Debian okay so - how many how many

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:10,690
people here are younger than Debian more

00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:14,350
people here we're people here are

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:17,470
younger have you then remember a Debian

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,640
which is amazing and and just because we

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,530
have a birthday cake up how many people

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,920
are celebrating their birthday or have

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,850
celebrated their birthday here at DEFCON

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,850
there's just a pas these people

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,690
so 23 years is a long time in my country

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:41,860
that means that Debian can drink and

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:44,290
Debian can vote and and we're we're but

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,640
the thing is we have people who have

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,300
been involved in this project the whole

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:52,690
time and and and we as a community

00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,240
looking around are generally well no one

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,310
is getting any younger right and with

00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,100
that comes a lot of considerations and I

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,560
know this is a really kind of heavy

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,900
topic to have so early in the morning so

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,510
I have a small mechanism for dealing

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,580
with this which is baby penguins okay

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,470
we're gonna have some pictures of baby

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:16,180
penguins as we talk about some of the

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,500
more difficult topics and and I thought

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,760
penguins were appropriate because we can

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:24,040
see them nearby which is super cool

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,600
so the really serious topic is that

00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,080
we've already lost a lot of people who

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,050
are important to us I may have missed

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:35,920
some names this is from looking around

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,420
the internet and some of the the deaths

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,220
have been more publicized than others

00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,260
and so I may be missing them but I

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,750
wanted to take a minute to remember the

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,380
Debian contributors who are no longer

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,130
with us

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,930
and I felt like having a talk about what

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,290
to do in the future is not complete

00:04:49,930 --> 00:05:00,550
without thinking about those whom we who

00:04:53,290 --> 00:05:02,710
are no longer here so many of the the

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:08,920
names on that list were people who who

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:10,780
died quite young and we tragedy can

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,920
happen to any of us at any time it's

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,440
just sort of the nature of life and

00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,480
Debian is fortunate enough to be such a

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,180
rich community with so many people that

00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:24,040
it's statistically going to happen at

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:26,250
any point but but we as a as a community

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,010
and as a free software community have

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:34,620
have been aging and we see overall more

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:37,030
gray hair and and we we have a hard time

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,979
finding people who have all of the

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,190
t-shirts for all the conferences from

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:44,740
the previous years

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:48,020
and it makes it a fun a fun challenge

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,520
but but there are a lot of things that I

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,590
think we haven't thought about very

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,320
deeply as a community and we haven't

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,720
figured out ways to to address them the

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,280
good news is that we are already doing a

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,500
lot of things right free software

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,510
inherently is planning for the future

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,400
because we're developing everything out

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,380
in the open and there are good records

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,570
and repositories for what we're doing I

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,090
think as we make sure that we have our

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,360
fievel resources and there's going to be

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,850
an interesting talk about about that

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,150
here an announcement around that I think

00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,400
that that's that's part of it but but

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,950
also the ways that we handle our

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,450
community and invite newcomers in we

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,920
have you know mechanisms for how we

00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,050
interact with each other we've got

00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:37,400
discussion channels everything can be

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,590
logged and when somebody when somebody

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,970
dies it doesn't mean that their work

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,360
dies with them because their work is a

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:47,720
living part of Debi and a living part of

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,880
our free software project so it's pretty

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,630
cool because inherent in the way free

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,120
software is operated is some mechanisms

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,230
for making sure to make sure that we can

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,290
all work with each other we're making

00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,610
sure that our legacy is built in and

00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:07,330
that we can continue working with each

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:09,890
other but you know sometimes things like

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,290
things that we take for granted actually

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,450
need some attention so a lot of the

00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:18,860
legal mechanisms around free and open

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:22,100
source software is copyright is there

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,790
anyone here and so who here is this

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:30,430
their first dub comp

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,430
awesome cool it's gay

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,710
and how how many people here this is

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:42,180
their first free software conference at

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:45,910
all so a couple of people it's great and

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,730
does anyone here not know and it's

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,080
totally understandable because this you

00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,500
have to learn about this how many people

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,350
don't know about what copyleft is does

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,830
anyone not know what copyleft is okay so

00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:02,290
so copyleft is a mechanism whereby we

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,810
use copyright but for sharing so free

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,450
software is is actually predicated on a

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,180
legal framework while it's all about the

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:13,180
software in order to make sure that we

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,190
share software we use copyright in order

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,100
to share and there are two major license

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:20,860
styles go super fast sorry everybody

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,200
two major license styles to oversimplify

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,150
everything there's permissive licensing

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,830
which basically says you can do whatever

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,770
you want with this license and there's

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,060
copyleft licensing which says that you

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,979
can do whatever you want with this

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,419
license provided that if you make

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,370
modifications and distribute those

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,380
changes that you do so under the same

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,210
license so detractors have called it

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,860
viral but it's like a snowballing effect

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:46,270
of forever free software that basically

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,780
makes sure that the software is forever

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,880
free and and it's it's because of using

00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,070
these legal mechanisms that we are able

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,380
to have this amazing rich technological

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,420
collaboration and it's a really

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,450
interesting legal hat but it basically

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,100
comes down to copyright no matter what

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,450
kind of community that you're in to have

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,520
assurance that you can build on the

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,350
software that you used before

00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,700
you have to know that you have the

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,430
permissions to use it and that those

00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:17,710
permissions are are ones that that will

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:19,630
survive scrutiny so sometimes it's

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,010
simply not enough to know that the

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,320
software has been licensed freely

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,910
sometimes there are interesting things

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,130
with licenses that happen there's

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,990
license compatibility all these are deep

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,030
legal context that concepts that are

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,250
there are plenty of places to discuss

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,040
online and and get really deep into it

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:40,300
but there are but there are some things

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:43,270
that there are times that you need to be

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,380
sure that you have you have the ability

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,330
to review your license

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,370
so has anybody here been involved in a

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,070
relicensing where a project had to

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,170
realize inspection okay so like like a

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,800
quarter of the group of it how many

00:09:53,170 --> 00:10:00,100
people here choose not to license their

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,200
code when they write it under an or

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,500
later so how many people here prefer to

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,970
do like gplv2 only or never to do or

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,610
layer two

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,620
so used to write so that's like maybe

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,030
like an eighth of the audience won't you

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,120
or later how many people deliberately

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,400
try to do or later so like okay like a

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,690
third okay so this is really interesting

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,800
stuff and you think that this stuff

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,080
doesn't really make that much of a

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,400
difference but it turns out that if

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,760
you've if you choose a particular

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,850
license that has no upgrade clause and

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,680
with the GPL has no upgrade cause and

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,130
that means that the GPL when you choose

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,200
GPL v2 or GPL v3 or any of the GPL

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,840
family licenses they're still automatic

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,240
like if there's a later version of the

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,370
license it automatically it gets

00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,830
upgraded to that license other licenses

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:52,480
have that cause but the GPL none of the

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:55,350
GPL do and so this is resolved by having

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,720
a when people choose a license they say

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,180
GPL whatever or later and that's kind of

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,590
like meta licensing this is all like I

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:09,910
kinda you guys are all life and seeing

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:11,260
experts coming out of but but I so what

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,720
happens is that if you've chosen a

00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,610
particular license and there's no

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,170
upgrade clause or if there's some reason

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,670
that a license is incompatible with

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,490
other software that it needs to be

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,140
combined with you could be in a

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,330
situation where you need to do a real

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,010
licensing you can do a relicensing

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,500
provided that all the people who hold

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:33,940
the copyright are available to relicense

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,670
it and so I have been involved more baby

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:40,420
penguins I have been involved in a

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:45,700
couple of relicensing where a number of

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:50,100
the contributors had died and I was in

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:54,270
the situation where I was talking to the

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:57,250
surviving spouse in three occasions to

00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,860
explain to them why we needed to do a

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:03,220
relicensing

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:06,459
what like what why it was important

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,670
what the what copyrights were and why

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:11,019
the person's spouse had taken so much

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,759
time to contribute to free and

00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:16,569
open-source software and what we were

00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:19,149
trying to accomplish overall and in two

00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:21,579
of those situations I was successful you

00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:24,040
know I was able to explain this is what

00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:26,110
free software is it's really cool your

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,410
spouse care deeply about what we were

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:33,999
working on together and wanted you know

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:37,240
this is a really cool legacy that you

00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:40,180
know that this person had and by

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,779
relicensing it it means that their

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,579
software will be included in software

00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,930
you know in in the ultimate product even

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,300
though there's a real licensing and even

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,249
though this person is no longer alive

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,889
and contributing to the project but in

00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:58,389
one situation I couldn't convince the

00:12:53,889 --> 00:13:01,600
spouse this the spouse said well you

00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:04,629
know he wanted me he wanted to provide

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,220
for me in this instance if he wanted to

00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:10,990
provide for me and so and so I know that

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,449
he wouldn't want me to realize and sit

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,749
because he would have wanted you to pay

00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:18,610
me and I said well he was contributing

00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:20,410
his software to this community because

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,170
he cared about it and it's it's

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,149
world-changing software and she said

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,740
well if it weren't important for me to

00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:28,629
riri licensing it you wouldn't have

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,850
called me and you wouldn't have gotten

00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:32,559
in touch and obviously it's extremely

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,179
important to you and therefore you

00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,120
should pay me and they went again and

00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:40,540
said and and and and in the end I was

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,149
not able to convince her and we had to

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,809
write that software out of the project

00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:48,309
which surely wasn't the right result and

00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:51,429
I couldn't figure out how best to

00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:53,370
explain it and at the end of the day you

00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:55,929
know we did the best that we could but

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:59,319
she wasn't involved in our community and

00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:00,610
she didn't understand understand the

00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:03,879
goals that we were trying to accomplish

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:06,250
and I I failed to explain it in a way

00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:09,639
that was convincing to her and I think

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,460
that probably is not that unusual that I

00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,740
think that maybe most of the time

00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,120
[Music]

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,210
significant others spouses will

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,490
understand what the what the the goals

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,470
are of free software because we spend so

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,140
much of our time doing it that we talk

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,720
about it but sometimes it simply doesn't

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:33,630
you know not everybody shares the same

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:37,000
understanding or the same values and

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:39,670
there are surely not there surely issues

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,320
that we haven't anticipated so there are

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,060
a lot of reasons why we might want to

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,279
relicense whether it's because we're

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,890
using different software that we hadn't

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,470
anticipated and combining it from one

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:53,260
project with with incompatible licensing

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,700
terms to another but there are surely

00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,680
things that are down the road that we

00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,750
don't even know are going to happen the

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,490
laws are changing rapidly I mean where

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,339
we live in a world where we could wake

00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:06,460
up one morning and the UK is leaving the

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:08,740
European Union you know like and and

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:13,120
we'll have a lot of work to do on

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:15,190
determining their you know how their

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,050
intellectual property regime shakes out

00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,700
from all of this there's a lot there are

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:22,600
a lot of areas that could change there

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:25,029
could be you know new laws in places

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,130
where we're we're already familiar with

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:29,800
how things work or we could wind up

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,630
having countries become much more

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,580
critical like much more involved in free

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,770
software higher percentages of

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,150
population from places where there are

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,980
laws that we're not even that familiar

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,660
with that turn out to be obstacles to

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,670
participating together there are a lot

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,860
of reasons why we might need to have

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,200
mechanisms over the control of our

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,140
copyrights in our code that we haven't

00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,020
even thought of and I think what as as

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,760
time ago I think it's amazing to me you

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,310
know I I still feel kind of like a

00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,320
newcomer home but I've been around LA

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,490
certainly long enough to see that

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,980
already there have been some major

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,170
changes but it's amazing to me how the

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,600
legal structures have held up and how

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,339
our basic presumptions about how free

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,700
software works and how we operate

00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:15,339
together have in fact you know played

00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:18,310
out and continued so one of the things

00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:22,420
that the companies have said they needed

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:23,740
to handle this was was clas or copyright

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,710
assignment or copyright licensing

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,480
agreements and I

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:30,200
I was on a panel at the desktop summit

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:33,830
in 2011 I had just become executive

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:38,090
director of genome and that's Mark

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:41,270
Shuttleworth they're sort of introducing

00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:46,270
some of the ideas around why canonical

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:49,190
wanted copyright assignment and that's

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:52,400
Bradley Kuhn and Michael Meeks who were

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,710
there basically teaming up and saying we

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,350
won't have copyright assignment we won't

00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,000
have skales but but what was amazing is

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,990
that following that panel there was like

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,520
a huge outpouring of vitriol for

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,650
copyright license agreements and

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,230
copyright assignment agreements and the

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:13,550
reasons why there were those reactions

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:15,350
was because the idea that that a company

00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,650
should be a steward of the license was

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,209
sort of you know people didn't didn't

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:24,860
like the idea the single company could

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:27,130
be in in so much control over over free

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:31,640
software and choose how to relicense it

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:35,720
so so in a world where we don't want our

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,610
companies to be the the sole steward of

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,920
what we get to do in the future and how

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:43,250
we realizin sit it comes back to us as

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:48,710
individuals so one of the things that I

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:53,140
saw when I was a new lawyer in the field

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:55,880
in I guess it was already it was 2006 I

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,760
was I I came I saw this problem

00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,460
immediately and I thought oh this is so

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,640
easy I'm gonna write a white paper to

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,220
like this week with like language that

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,380
we could put into people's wills and

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:13,280
then developers can basically handle

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,300
this all with no problem they said the

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,310
people be no problem at all I'll just

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,750
put it guys some magic language and I'll

00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,310
publish it and you can put it in your

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,210
will and you can bequeath your

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,550
copyrights to the free software

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,870
foundation or wherever you thought that

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,810
your copyrights should go whatever

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:29,780
entity that you trust but I call the

00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:32,810
trust and estate lawyer and and she

00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,730
started to laugh and she said well I

00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,640
don't know I mean I'm just a trust and

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,419
estates lawyer in New York but that

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,129
that's

00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:42,440
not really gonna work you know that and

00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:45,919
I don't know that this is not gonna so I

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,169
called I called trusts and estates

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,179
lawyers in in other major jurisdictions

00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,909
in the United States like in this is all

00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:55,070
state by state in the US so I called a

00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:58,580
you know the trust net States lawyer in

00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,869
Oregon and in in Massachusetts do you

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,909
know the places were a lot of free

00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:03,980
software people live and the answers

00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:06,049
were mixed but at the end of the day

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,669
it's clear that it's not a silver bullet

00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:10,220
that you can simply bequeath your

00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:13,429
copyrights to someone and have that work

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:16,730
out it what happens is that there's a

00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:19,519
chance that the copyrights so that the

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:22,820
will will be probated and probated is

00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,379
basically reviewed by a judge like the

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,659
the will have to go through legal

00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:28,330
mechanisms in order to test its validity

00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:32,600
and determine how it needs to be

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:34,340
implemented and and if the will is

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,820
probated there's a chance that there

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:40,129
could be taxes levied on the copyrights

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:43,730
that are bequeathed so it's possible

00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:45,679
that if you if you just like like sort

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,779
of stay in your will I want my

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,879
copyrights to go to the Free Software

00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:51,529
Foundation then there's a chance that

00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:54,019
while the Free Software Foundation may

00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:55,940
be the right place for it that and and

00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,230
everybody wants your copyrights to go to

00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,429
the Free Software Foundation I keep

00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,899
gesturing to John I'm good but but what

00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,029
while that might be the right thing to

00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:07,309
do if there are taxis living it could

00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:09,470
come out of the money that the estate

00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:12,169
had so that means that whatever money

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:15,470
you had when you died could be reduced

00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:17,690
by a portion for taxes just for

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,919
copyrights that are valuable because

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,600
they're part of a free and open-source

00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:24,019
software project but that you would

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,629
never even consider selling and you know

00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:32,539
so it's a it's this strange situation

00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:34,759
where where bequeathment simply won't

00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:35,899
won't do the trick because all right

00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,460
wasn't something I needed some baby

00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:40,220
penguins here where we thought about the

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,249
fact that the money that we left behind

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,799
for our loved ones might be reduced by

00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:49,669
taxes simply because we used a clumsy

00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,430
mechanism and when you think about all

00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:54,310
of this

00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:57,880
it's you start thinking well you know

00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:59,320
even even if I could even if so even if

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,150
I can't bequeath it well then what

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,640
happens to my copyrights if I do nothing

00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,250
and the answer is generally that it goes

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,310
along the same the same pathways to our

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,960
next of kin so if you do nothing with

00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,280
your copyrights that means that when you

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,840
die it will flow through the ordinary

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:21,100
course also there may be taxes but but

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:23,380
if you putting that issue aside thinking

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,500
about who who would be the next

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:29,530
recipient recovered so I you know when

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,930
when I was originally talking and

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,930
thinking about copyright license

00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:39,130
agreements and assignment agreements the

00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:40,690
the sheer vitriol for them I was trying

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,010
to get a handle on it and why people

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,570
didn't how many people here have a

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,570
strong feeling they never want to assign

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,580
their copyrights to anyone ever okay so

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,520
not that many people it's just for

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,370
people in the audience I've experienced

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,350
that in in many many more numbers in

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,070
that where people have no job and I sort

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:02,410
of go back to them and say well you know

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,330
who will inherit the copyrights and do

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:08,860
they understand it and one friend of

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:10,210
mine who's a Debian developer had never

00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,330
thought about this before and I said

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,410
well does your mother understand free

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:18,100
and open source software normally I

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:19,570
avoid trying to say mother or

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,210
grandmother because they're you know

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,910
people never but but in this case this

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,830
particular case it was his who his

00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:30,250
mother is his next of kin and I said

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:33,130
geez your mother understand free and

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:35,200
open source software and while she's an

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,150
extremely smart lady she doesn't she's

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,680
not really had that much experience and

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,660
because of their relationship they don't

00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,810
really talk about like have you talked

00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:47,140
to your parents about free software

00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:49,060
but okay but but they hadn't had

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,380
occasion to talk about it and his mother

00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,060
would be the one who would receive a

00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,910
copyrights in the instance that anything

00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,130
happened to him and where many of us are

00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,440
working on really critical pieces of

00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,390
free and open-source software where that

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,240
copyright could transfer to someone who

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,800
doesn't have the the background doesn't

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,850
have the experience doesn't have the

00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,970
interest and doesn't have the knowledge

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:15,130
it really puts it could potentially put

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:16,360
a progress of project at risk so part of

00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,680
this is okay because you can assign

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,890
today with no problem

00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,840
you know if I were a perhaps a better

00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,310
salesman I would say and this is why you

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,990
need to sign your copyrights to the

00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,810
Debian cover aggregation project with

00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,190
Conservancy but but that's simply an

00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,960
oversimplification and what we're

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,570
looking for here is the best solution

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,280
for free software and for Debian and

00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:38,320
making sure that we choose the right

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,700
mechanisms overall but what's

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,340
interesting about the fact that you can

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,050
assign today with no problem is that if

00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,610
you don't have issues around like they

00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,380
call it consideration making sure that

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,900
the contract is valid it's pretty much

00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:53,110
understood in every jurisdiction that I

00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,270
have researched that there's a way to do

00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:57,040
it today you may have to figure out a

00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:00,160
way to deal with moral rights depending

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,830
on where you are but we pretty much

00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,010
understand that that will is very likely

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,570
to be upheld and you can assign it today

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,550
but most people many people don't want

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,980
to assign it today and so I've been

00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:15,340
noodling around in a lot of these

00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:18,160
questions because for like a decade

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,890
because what we need is something like

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,570
perpetual care for copyrights right we

00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:25,510
need something like you know perpetual

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,770
care is when if you and I hope that most

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:30,340
of you have not had this experience

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,970
before but when you bury somebody in a

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,620
cemetery

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,980
I need another baby penguin and I don't

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:38,590
have one here when you bury someone you

00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,720
can whom you can purchase what they call

00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,340
perpetual care so they do plantings and

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,250
they agree that they will continue to

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,780
maintain the gravesite and and water the

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,760
plants and you can buy this for yourself

00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,040
it's there you can do like it's like a

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,980
living will and I highly recommend

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,720
everybody to think hard about their what

00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,500
they want to happen when they die

00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,790
because it's like one

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,370
the best gifts you can give to the

00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:05,600
people you love to already have arranged

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:07,940
these things before you you know before

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,040
before you you die and these people are

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,060
left in the situation where where the

00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,800
people you love are left with the

00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,030
situation where they're they're dealing

00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,320
with the shock and the grieving that

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,640
you've died but then they also have to

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,260
make all these decisions and figure out

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,470
what you wanted and what you didn't want

00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,700
we need more baby penguins but but

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,680
instead of thinking that it's perpetual

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,480
care and thinking it in terms of

00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,660
funerals we can instead think of it in

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,660
terms of potatoes because because

00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,640
because because really copyrights are

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,590
not are not things that we don't need a

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,210
mausoleum for our copyrights right

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,980
what's cool about our free software

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,840
copyrights is that the hope is it will

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,220
only be a problem if they continue to be

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,980
useful right if they're gonna continue

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,750
to be used and so what I love about this

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,630
is that is that each of those potatoes

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:53,810
is potential or is sprouting right and

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,460
ideally if we write code that is great

00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:57,620
and useful it'll be used again and again

00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,840
in a number of different ways and what

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,940
we need is is is a way to handle these

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,540
copyrights that's a way to help them

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:07,510
living and vibrant and so the copyright

00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,940
aggregation project that we put together

00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:12,530
handles this in part right it handles it

00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,880
for people who want this who don't want

00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,290
to think about this now so if you want

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,090
to just never think about your

00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,130
copyrights again you can assign to

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,690
something like the the W copyright

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,000
aggregation project and Bradley's going

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,790
to do a whole talk on that on Thursday

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,780
so you can go check that out if if

00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,990
you're interested and we'll have

00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:33,440
agreements and all of that stuff but if

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:35,570
you want to if you and that's perfect

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,670
especially if you are interested in

00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,800
having your copyrights enforced or

00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:43,280
having Debian some copyrights and Debian

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,600
enforced and not having to and having

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,820
whatever involvement you want in that

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,310
process but if you want to be a part of

00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,530
a group effort to do that but that is

00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:53,420
that's a problem that's a solution for

00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:57,290
now and so I've been kind of thinking

00:26:53,420 --> 00:27:00,170
about what to do for the future and and

00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:02,060
it finally like a year ago I had this

00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:05,180
lightning bolt that we need a trust and

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:07,670
I am so legally geeky that this is like

00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,100
I was like I trust we can have a trust

00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,730
oh my god finally we can solve this it

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,670
was like

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:17,000
we could do this right you know it's and

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:20,210
so I and so what we can do is we could

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,880
set up a trust so that we assign today

00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,800
so so you want so many people want to

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,890
keep some of the rights they don't want

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,150
to assign their their copyrights because

00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,810
they want to keep some control for some

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,770
people that means the ability to control

00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:36,380
enforcement and they definitely don't

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,610
want to win a trust anybody else to go

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,470
anywhere near and forcing their

00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,850
copyrights for some people it's just the

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,680
idea that they want to hold their

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:47,480
copyrights and it's a it's a principled

00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:52,220
conceptual thing and so with this idea

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:55,490
you could assign it today but you get a

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,810
grant back of all or some of the rights

00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,720
which are all of the things that you

00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:02,720
really care about so basically you could

00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,210
put your copyright in a trust today so

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,550
that is physically like it's it's tough

00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:09,920
physically but it's it's legally held by

00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:14,180
a trust and then they the trust then

00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:16,850
grants back to you the right to enforce

00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,890
in some circumstances or your right to

00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,060
you could realize you could sublicense

00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,830
it so you could license it under

00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,560
something else a lot of times that's not

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,240
particularly meaningful because you you

00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,920
the software is part of a project that

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,990
has a particular license but the idea

00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,430
that you could sub license it you could

00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,570
you could do that and you could have all

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,370
the rights that you would have had if

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,970
you've kept the copyrights that you care

00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:38,210
about

00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:40,490
but then the copyrights are held by the

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:43,270
trust and when you die that grant

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,650
expires so it's like this like kind of

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,930
springing mechanism even though it's not

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,010
actually a springing mechanism and I got

00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,920
really excited about this and I think

00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:53,270
that that it really has a chance of

00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,020
working and I'm mentioning this

00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:59,270
half-baked idea to you now I'll tell you

00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,440
at this point because I think that this

00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:04,130
is the kind of thing that can't be

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,310
solved by some external legal entity all

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:10,060
of a sudden this can't this isn't a

00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:13,430
project that can be taken out taken on

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,810
you know by me alone and offer it as an

00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:18,170
option it's something that we need to

00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:20,120
design with with everybody's input and I

00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:22,250
think that it could be relevant for

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,910
Debian and every other free software

00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,570
project but

00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:30,360
is the you know is such an important

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,100
leader in the in thought for free and

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,170
open source software and so I'm going to

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,500
develop like telling you the where this

00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:40,740
idea goes and think about it and tell me

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,420
what you think Howie how idea could be

00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,590
improved and then also where it could

00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:49,590
possibly be funded but what's cool about

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,840
this idea is that if we have a trust

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:55,200
that's holding the copyrights and it's a

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,300
and we're we're doing the the the

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,610
license back and that expires when you

00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,710
die and then the trust holds it is that

00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,710
you could have a checklist of things

00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,360
that you think are okay for to be done

00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,090
with your copyrights going forward so

00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,640
you could say for example that I I'm

00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,470
okay with the trust relicensing it so

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,710
long as it's real licensed under a

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,900
copyleft I'm okay with it relicensing so

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:23,280
long as it's under only a lacks

00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:25,560
permissive license I'm okay if it's real

00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,180
licensed by any license that under any

00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,270
license that's stewarded by the Free

00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:34,230
Software Foundation or another entity

00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:36,510
that you particularly trust and or I

00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,120
only want it to be relicensed

00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:40,410
for a change in the law so it's cool

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,660
because we could do like a creative

00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:44,880
common style simplified checklist of

00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,070
what you're okay with being done with

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,280
your software or going forward and I

00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,570
think that that's but then if we do that

00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,000
we also have this really cool

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,770
opportunity for a registry for free and

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,330
open source software so in order to

00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,310
assign your copyrights to this obviously

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,070
the trust will have to maintain contact

00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:04,590
information for everybody and and keep

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,340
track of of what they hold in the trust

00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,070
which means they'll have the

00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,330
infrastructure for a registry and one of

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,610
the things that we have had a problem

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:15,120
with or that we've come across with in

00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:16,470
outreach E and bringing in people from

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,300
diverse backgrounds is that not

00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:22,140
everybody wants to be identify mean how

00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:25,440
many people here are reluctant to put

00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:29,280
their real name in a public in any

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,020
public place so like yeah like quite a

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,340
number of people and there are probably

00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,210
people who didn't want to identify

00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,800
themselves

00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:39,290
so what you could do with the trap with

00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,330
this particular idea is that they the

00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:44,270
trust could hold up you could register a

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:46,070
handle and have it in one place or or

00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:48,559
two handles or three handles and then

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,720
you have the the benefits of anonymity

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,460
while having the legal structures in

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,230
place so that there's not the danger of

00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:57,860
having copyrights that can't be tracked

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,510
and can't be an art looked for and also

00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,610
it helps people who have reason to

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:03,680
change their name so they can contact it

00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:05,780
in one placement with the relicensing x'

00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,650
that i have done there have always been

00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:11,030
pieces of software that you couldn't

00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:12,620
that we couldn't relicense because we

00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,940
never got we were just simply we're

00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,200
never able to get in touch with the

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,580
person again because they were using an

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,860
old email address so here you would only

00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:22,220
need to keep your address up-to-date

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,929
with one particular entity and then I

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,640
got all thinking what's even cooler

00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,010
about it is that it might not have to be

00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,080
just for individuals so if companies did

00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,750
this we could have the same kind of

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:36,200
springing arrangement where copyrights

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:38,210
could where companies could put their

00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,520
copyrights in a trust and get all the

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,679
rights granted back to them but that

00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,710
could terminate upon for example an

00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,260
acquisition or some kind of change in

00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:50,450
policy if a company it could be whatever

00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,490
the company wants to do in terms of

00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:55,190
showing its good will to the environment

00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:58,550
so for example if it files for you know

00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:00,020
if it if it prosecutes a patent so it's

00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,280
a really interesting legal mechanism of

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,050
almost done actually and then we can

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:08,240
open it up for questions

00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:10,000
and so this Holt so there's a lot of

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,690
possibilities with this and I think that

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
that I have to admit that it's totally

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,610
vaporware okay I've been working on this

00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,410
for a very long time but there's nothing

00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,000
there's no there there we don't I think

00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,490
that once we design it they'll be very

00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,800
easy to put it in place legally but if

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:30,890
we put something in place to care for

00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:34,640
our copyrights and stewardship of our

00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:36,200
projects for if we put a project like

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,520
this in place we need to make sure it's

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,780
right we need to make sure it's really

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,420
right and we need to make sure we have

00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,880
the right public mechanisms for talking

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,040
about whether this is the trusted entity

00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,440
that everybody can believe in or not we

00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,340
need to design its governance

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:54,670
it's a huge project and one that is

00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,830
uncomfortable because we absolutely have

00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,440
to talk about the fact that we are all

00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:01,720
going to die it's it's it's easier baby

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,650
penguins it's easier for me you know

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,810
it's like certainly it's been easy for

00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:06,070
it's been hard well it's been I've been

00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,410
thinking about these issues in part

00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,610
because of being public and talking

00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,410
about the fact that I have a heart

00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,330
condition which is something I would

00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,770
never have liked to do if I and I would

00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,480
never do it if I didn't think that it

00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:19,150
would explain stuff or freedom so well

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,730
but having so many people say to me oh

00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:24,310
that's so horrible for you like are you

00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:26,140
going to die soon

00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:30,130
and so it sort of made me think a lot

00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:33,340
about these issues and how you know and

00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:34,900
and how we are simply while we're really

00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,310
good planners and free and open source

00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,380
software we're not confronting these

00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,240
issues around the legal mechanisms and

00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:43,630
the fact that that we're going to have a

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,130
big change over at some point soon and

00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,990
in the meantime we have to continue

00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,970
doing all the things that we're we're

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,429
doing to tend to our social structure

00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:53,140
and expect to turn over in our in our

00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:55,929
participation for all kinds of reasons

00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,330
including death so in the meantime the

00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:00,040
fact that Debbie and participates in

00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:03,880
Summer of Code and how many people here

00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:06,730
are our Summer of Code graduates and

00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,890
outreach II graduates yeah or

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:12,070
participants or participants

00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,990
participants is good and yeah so a lot

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:18,190
of people and it's we finding ways to

00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:19,840
get to get new people involved is it

00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,700
going to be a really important part of

00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,720
the social mechanisms of staying vibrant

00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:27,430
and staying relevant and also continuing

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,920
to talk about our ideals and a freedom

00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,450
and not taking those things for granted

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,510
and then also there's a lot of

00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:36,460
opportunity with age aside from all of

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,990
the the cliche things about the

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,170
experience that one gets with age which

00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:42,280
is surely true there are is anyone here

00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:45,270
willing to admit that they were thinking

00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,650
about retiring like yes so like quite

00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,330
actually quite a number of people in the

00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,280
audience are thinking about retiring and

00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:54,790
so there's tremendous opportunity

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,190
because you know like free software is

00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,260
so much fun and so when people retire

00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,450
who are free software people they're

00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,579
probably gonna write a lot of code

00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,890
like there's gonna be a really cool

00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:08,680
opportunity if we make it if we continue

00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:10,299
to make it fun and are excited to get

00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,559
people who are retiring into our

00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:15,940
communities they might contribute a

00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:17,920
tremendous amount and like keep rockin

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,510
deaf comp like having a conference where

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,520
people are really excited to come where

00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:24,700
they'll travel all the way to whatever

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,470
location that Deb Crump is hosted in is

00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,799
a really important part of maintaining

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:33,450
culture and passing on the ideals so

00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:35,619
that the project continues to be vibrant

00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,150
that's the end of the proper talk I

00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:40,599
should mention that Conservancy is

00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:42,609
having a fundraiser here and we're we

00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,890
have a matching anonymous donor has

00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:47,890
generously agreed to match donations for

00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:50,349
Deb comp attendees so if you if you

00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,910
donated indicate that you signed up at

00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:55,329
DEFCON fate will will get double which

00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:57,339
is really really cool so thank you very

00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:58,660
much and I think I have like a few

00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:01,710
minutes for questions and there was a

00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,710
question in fact there

00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:23,310
okay thanks for your talking just a

00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,310
question from the corporate side of you

00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:32,410
so the question is again not for my

00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:33,790
employer just in general I'm trying to

00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:35,710
understand like corporate law which I'm

00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,750
quite new to wouldn't it be sort of

00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:39,610
fiscally irresponsible and thus open a

00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:41,590
company to liability especially if

00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:43,000
they're publicly traded if they had some

00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:45,310
sort of contract or cause that

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,380
automatically transfers away their

00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:50,950
copyrights on bankruptcy or acquisition

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,910
or so on you know it depends on it it

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,710
sort of depends on how they're

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,240
structured and what their plans are and

00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,140
what the project like what the product

00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:02,260
is if there's a business case that the

00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:04,510
that the product will be more successful

00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,430
if they're you know for example if

00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,600
you're building a product for a product

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,800
that relies on free software for the

00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,660
beginning and you believe that you will

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,940
get a lot of an investment a lot of

00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,160
successful external Rd if you'll get a

00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,130
lot of benefit and a lot of buy-in and

00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:22,720
it's a product where where collaboration

00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:24,190
is essential and then then you can sort

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,570
of set these things up in the in a

00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,280
similar way it's it's part of the

00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,440
overall risk analysis for the company

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,750
it's just like your question is very

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,100
similar to questions that were surely

00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,860
asked originally about free software

00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,120
licenses to begin with isn't it it

00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:41,770
responsible and opening company up to

00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:43,600
liability to to grant a sharing license

00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:45,910
over our software so it's sort of

00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,590
companies will have to come in it and

00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,180
it's sort of a tiny bit of a flight of

00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,790
fancy because I don't think that I think

00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,670
it will be somewhat unusual at least

00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,890
initially for a public company that's a

00:38:54,670 --> 00:39:00,670
large company in our space to jump into

00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:02,200
this and you know but I think that

00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,990
especially for small company starting

00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,640
out or for new products especially for

00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,530
free software projects that are

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,470
collaboration efforts that it's a

00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:13,090
demonstration of good faith to do this

00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,890
and provided that all of the rights that

00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,080
are necessary in order to protect the

00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:19,570
company's interests are built into it I

00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,829
think it should be possible I guess I

00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,180
think it's a good idea I'm just

00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:24,099
that I think companies are very

00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,839
risk-averse and even getting companies

00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,880
to pop you left has turned out to be

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,839
quite difficult so this might even be

00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,239
even insurmountable in many cases it

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,650
might be but but I would say that people

00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,259
definitely thought that copyleft was

00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:40,509
insurmountable and pretty much they're

00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:42,219
all using the Linux kernel so it's that

00:39:40,509 --> 00:39:44,019
it's it's all a risk analysis if the

00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:46,900
company so as per my talk yesterday if

00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:48,519
the kind of companies can convince a can

00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,170
convince everybody that permissive

00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,719
licensing that whatever holds the most

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,279
rights for them it's best for it works

00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,869
then that'll they'll you know they'll

00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:57,130
take advantage of that if we can

00:39:55,869 --> 00:40:00,430
convince them that there's an advantage

00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,959
to to participating in something like

00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,609
this just like it there's an advantage

00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:06,420
of participating in the Linux kernel I

00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:09,459
believe they might do it especially for

00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:12,069
for new initiatives I think that it

00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:16,599
could be a very innovative show of good

00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:18,160
faith so hi Sam Harmon um first of all

00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:21,910
this is really interesting stuff and

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,650
thank you for presenting it um so I'd

00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,989
like to ask you to consider something

00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,609
when when developing this trust as I've

00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:30,369
been thinking about what I would like to

00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:33,099
happen to a lot of my stuff you know

00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:35,589
when I'm no longer in a position to make

00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:39,009
decisions whether I'm dead or simply

00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:41,259
incapacitated well at least in American

00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:44,640
jurisprudence the compañera was supposed

00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:47,619
to be a limited time right that you know

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,229
in exchange for this / - lemon thyme

00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:52,449
monopoly you're more willing to share

00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:55,749
your stuff you know maybe by selling it

00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:57,430
or whatever oh and you know for a

00:40:55,749 --> 00:41:01,420
variety of reasons confident has gotten

00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:03,519
to be a fairly long live right um I I

00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:07,630
think that behind being able to have an

00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:09,459
option like where um you know to say

00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,619
some number of years after my death like

00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:14,009
order of five as opposed to what is it

00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:16,630
75 but no it's like ridiculously long

00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:18,819
now may as well be forever

00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,369
oh well yeah but I mean it's not

00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:22,569
officially forever but you know I mean

00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:26,979
we've seen this Supreme Court case

00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:30,279
rather you know but um we're effectively

00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:31,959
if a few years after my death basically

00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:34,390
things were licensed under the most

00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:36,569
permissive license as possible effect

00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:39,750
if there was a copyright had expired I

00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:42,250
at least would find that sort of option

00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:45,730
very appealing because I think that

00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:48,119
there's a balancing act between grabbing

00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:53,589
power and copyright as a form of power

00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:55,269
and also accepting it that I don't want

00:41:53,589 --> 00:42:00,069
to control the future that I want to let

00:41:55,269 --> 00:42:02,200
the future do its own thing yeah I think

00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:03,309
that's absolutely i 100% agree with

00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,569
everything you said and that's one of

00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:06,430
the things that we could do with the

00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:08,920
with a trust is we could have a an

00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:11,799
automat like a an option to have your

00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,349
works licensed under CC 0 which is

00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:15,579
effectively as close to the public

00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:20,890
domain as we can get in many

00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:22,390
jurisdictions so yeah so I think we just

00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,950
have some time for some more questions

00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:27,339
because there's no talk directly

00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:28,930
afterwards and if anybody feels like

00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:49,690
they need to get coffee because it's

00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:52,990
early my job to do this comes from a

00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:55,269
Jatin what might be some so some reasons

00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:57,730
while people involved in free software

00:42:55,269 --> 00:43:01,509
projects not one to license their code

00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:05,289
with GPL despite its social verges sorry

00:43:01,509 --> 00:43:07,599
I missed about the white people involved

00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:11,230
in free software projects do not want to

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:14,349
license their code with GPL despite its

00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:18,460
social future why don't people want a

00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:19,960
license under whoa I can't possibly

00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,930
understand why anyone wouldn't want to

00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,819
license no I'm actually I should say

00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,559
conservancies license agnostic we have

00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:28,750
projects that are permissively lacks

00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,750
permissibly license and we have projects

00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:34,240
that are our our copy strong copy left

00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,130
and want to want to enforce those

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,140
licenses so for conservancies

00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:40,529
perspective it's very neutral for me

00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:44,380
I'll tell you that I started out being

00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:46,089
also very license agnostic and then part

00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,280
of it was that I had a lot of clients

00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:49,530
who were

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,349
part of permissively license projects

00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:54,780
where they really felt you know I mean I

00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:57,210
was counseled to a couple of the bsds

00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,849
originally like felt passionately that

00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:02,310
it was a different kind of freedom and

00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:05,640
you know that it was you know free if

00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:07,590
you imposed restrictions but now I've

00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,540
sort of you know and and that the GPL

00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:11,369
was a form of restriction but as time

00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,950
has passed and I have understood sort of

00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:14,970
and I've gone through my own personal

00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:17,430
struggling with not having the source

00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:20,160
code to my defibrillator and connecting

00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:22,140
my reliance on that software to to our

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,580
use of software and the fact that we

00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,680
don't even know what software we're

00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:28,530
going to be relying on I have come over

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,630
strongly to the GPL captain and I think

00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:33,140
that that that I think that once you

00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:35,369
realize that if you don't have the

00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,230
access to the to the complete and

00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:39,210
corresponding source code and the

00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,890
scripts for installation which is those

00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,480
are like the words from but if you don't

00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:45,180
you're not going to be able to deal with

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,980
a security problem and so I think you're

00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,750
not you're not necessarily but anyway so

00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,790
you nobody here needs me to convince

00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,230
them about the virtues of copyleft but I

00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:54,480
think that a lot of people don't really

00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,099
understand the long-term implications of

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,170
the of these licensing choices and we're

00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:59,250
going to need some failures

00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:01,410
unfortunately and more baby penguins

00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,470
somewhere but we really need failures in

00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,790
order for people to understand why

00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,710
copyleft is so important and we're going

00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:10,380
to need what's happening is that is that

00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:13,230
we're already starting to see some of

00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,540
the some problems from the fragmentation

00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:17,490
around some of the permissively license

00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,200
project and developers will be

00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:22,530
frustrated that they no longer have

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,150
access to the the projects effectively

00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,589
that they were a major part of earlier

00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,440
because it's gone off in a proprietary

00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:30,500
fork and so i think that that there are

00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,030
a lot of reasons why people choose

00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,580
permissibly license projects i have to

00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:38,460
say i don't understand why why there's

00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:40,290
why the folks that have vitriol for

00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,750
copyleft have vitriol I think that is

00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,160
simply not thinking I think that to me

00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,690
that's not really thinking that deeply

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,220
about the project if you make a choice

00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,550
because you've thought reasonably about

00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,900
these different licenses and you choose

00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:55,050
one thing or another that's totally fine

00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:58,680
but the the hate that had been exhibited

00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:00,930
for the GPL I I think

00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,779
probably means that we need to talk more

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:05,249
about in a calm way about why copyleft

00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:06,809
is so important and it's not about

00:46:05,249 --> 00:46:09,839
polarizing personalities

00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:22,680
it's not about tribe it's about a

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:27,539
license choice this is from a purely and

00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:31,829
and from a purely a human reaction

00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:36,749
standpoint it is frustrating to be

00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:41,940
forced into a decision and basically G

00:46:36,749 --> 00:46:46,440
the GPL is all about creating incentives

00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:48,690
that are so strong that that you you

00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,220
will cheat that you know that in some

00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:54,869
cases there have been people who have

00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:57,089
had to use the GPL because the there was

00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:59,069
a large enough Commons and that's an a

00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:02,430
specific design goal of the GPL to

00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:05,700
create that Commons and feeling like you

00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:07,109
were powerless feeling like despite the

00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:10,019
fact that you would really like to do

00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:12,630
something else that some other entity is

00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:14,369
forcing you into a decision which is

00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:17,660
what a Commons does which is what a

00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:22,880
Commons like the GPL does can be a very

00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:26,970
a very emotionally negative experience

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:29,309
um on the other eye I do understand the

00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:32,190
other flip side of that but I mean that

00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:35,039
kind of force when it's applied to you

00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:43,619
is is something that make it a really

00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:46,739
strong negative reaction I know lots of

00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:48,079
things to ask and M sure this can a with

00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:50,519
this community this can lead to a

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,089
endless debate which will be very

00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:55,019
productive

00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:57,119
but we could maybe do a buff on another

00:47:55,019 --> 00:48:00,690
day as people are interested so please

00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,670
we we are over time already so cut this

00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:05,059
session short and they well thank you

00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,059
very much

00:48:06,109 --> 00:48:12,409
you

00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,409
