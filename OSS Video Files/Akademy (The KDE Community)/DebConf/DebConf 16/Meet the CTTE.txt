Thank You Thomas great

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,599
welcome to the me to type in Technical

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:13,679
Committee to buff or talk whatever that

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,240
is we plan to have a short reminder of

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,800
what exactly the type in Technical

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,609
Committee is and I'll start with

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,369
presenting the actual members so we have

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,189
on the last part to my left

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,990
Don Armstrong is unfortunately not at

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,859
DEP conf

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,360
we have Keith Packard myself Alex I'm

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,230
the current chair of the Technical

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,700
Committee

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:43,260
Toula fog in some Hartmann and two hands

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,289
I'll start with what is the Devon

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,000
Technical Committee actually it's all

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,620
written in the Debian Constitution which

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,649
is the Bible you should have buy a bed

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,750
and read it from time to time it's

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,390
useful for getting along in the project

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,239
so six point one says the Technical

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:04,890
Committee may decide on any matter of

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,540
technical policy it may decide any

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,369
technical matter where developers

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,439
jurisdictions overlap and make a

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,939
decision when asked to do so that's

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:17,790
basically tiebreaking it may overrule

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,240
the developer with a 3-1 majority that's

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,799
the nuclear weapon we have we don't use

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,869
it much it's the last resort point and

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,680
six one five says we may offer offer

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:35,070
advice for the project or for any

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,930
question basically we are limited in in

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,110
these powers by some of the some

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,210
constraints amongst which we have to

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,960
have public discussion and decision

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:53,119
making we cannot do detailed design work

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,119
and we make decision only as last resort

00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,530
constitutionally we're picking options

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,710
that means we are asked to break ties

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,290
with amongst available options after all

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:09,030
efforts to resolve it via consensus have

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,649
been tried and failed and we can make

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,770
offer advice and make our views known

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:19,100
that means we can offer you advice

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:21,630
if you want after all that

00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,830
constitutional thing we can say the

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,910
Debian Technical Committee as a

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,600
self-nominated

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:31,440
and DPL appointed last resort conflict

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,750
resolution and advice providing body any

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,960
questions so far I know it was quick but

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,770
you might you all know that so let's

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,200
move on it was traditional of the

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,300
Technical Committee talk to have a short

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,360
review of the past issues that we had in

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,450
the in the TC since the previous step

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:56,370
conf it they are all listed under the

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:58,620
tech city te pseudo bug lists and we try

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,710
to have everything we are publicly

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:08,160
discussing there we have actually

00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:11,130
decided on two six issues I won't read

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,530
all of them but there were two that made

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,770
it into a gr which on which we voted in

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:20,880
March about super majority fix and

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:25,770
duplicate section numbering we had one

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,660
on the menu system we had one discussion

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,450
about how we want to appoint the

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,340
technical committee chair we didn't make

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,670
it a constitutional change we just

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:40,620
adopted it as an internal procedure we

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:44,880
have proposed fill for nomination to new

00:03:40,620 --> 00:04:00,240
as DPL back then and we have voted for

00:03:44,880 --> 00:04:02,400
the city heat chair we also had four

00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,390
issues that were dropped or retracted in

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,680
the last year there was the coordinate

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,100
plan and requirements for cross

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,320
toolchain packages in debian we some

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:18,989
weeks ago we decided to drop that issue

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:21,960
from our list yeah we also had two other

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:23,940
things concerning how the TCC works

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,090
itself so the introduction of the formal

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,889
cloture vote and change in the current

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,250
lucien to permit us to hold private

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:34,560
conversation which we dropped by saying

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,990
it's already permitted and we make use

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,449
of that right and there was a discussion

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,550
between the OpenSSL maintainer and the

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:45,330
stable release managers about new

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:51,780
OpenSSL option versions which found its

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:54,030
way outside of the TC exactly and we

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:58,530
have currently only one open issue that

00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:00,210
is new technical committee members which

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:06,630
brings me to the next point we are

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:09,800
looking for new members as an

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,880
introduction for this we have adopted

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,250
two or three years ago in the

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,130
Constitution a new thing about term

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,710
expiry which says on January 1st of each

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,600
year well you can read it basically it

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,080
says the term last three and a half

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,360
years roughly and it's a small set of

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,020
conditions so we can see here the list

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,600
of the expiry dates kind of expiry years

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,030
in order that means that we will be

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,350
losing under less and done by the end of

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,550
this year

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:47,490
Keith next year telephone myself in 18

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:50,190
and then Simon Phil in 19 that means we

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:57,389
need fresh blood we're roughly looking

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:58,950
for at least one new member we're

00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:02,070
roughly looking for at least one new

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,289
member per year it's between one and two

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,300
but if we can at least have one new

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:13,160
member per year it can be sustainable

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,160
not all these shoes are like 72 77 0

00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:24,720
most not all so um I will tell you that

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,830
the most the work I've done on the

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,860
Technical Committee that I'm really

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,920
proud about was something that took me

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,150
one evening and basically someone had

00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,210
written to the Technical Committee

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,910
really frustrated because the release

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,760
manager didn't accept the package patch

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,680
and they believed that that there sought

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,560
without that patch their software would

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:51,300
be something that that they couldn't

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,650
maintain and they basically you know

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,720
we're really frustrated about this and

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,900
like how could this come about how could

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,580
the release manager not care I took some

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,750
time because the realest managers are

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,790
pretty busy and so I'm not a release

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,730
manager but I can talk about you know

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:08,100
the the trade-offs here and said what

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,020
you know the release manager has to make

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,460
some trade-offs and it's absolutely fine

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,350
for you to say well if you won't take

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,380
this patch you're gonna need to find

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,300
someone else to maintain that software

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,860
in the release because I don't want to

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,620
do the work yeah I mean you know we're

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,330
volunteers um but it's also fine for the

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,130
release manager without saying you're a

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:31,280
bad person or anything like that to say

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:34,950
um I don't trust the risk of this patch

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,160
and being able to write that up and they

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:41,490
kind of explained that situation is the

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,840
thing that was is I think so far my best

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,700
contribution to the Technical Committee

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,960
and that was really easy and I think was

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,460
helpful I don't know whether it was

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,410
helpful to the individual person but

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,030
several other people have come in and

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,250
read that and said ah that was actually

00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,580
a really useful thing to think about the

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,870
issues involved there actually I mean

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,590
I'm one of the survivors of spark

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,630
mentioned before I think I need to say

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,360
it's this way and most issues that they

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,250
had I did not set that but Lassa people

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,280
had some misunderstanding and needed

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,650
some extra help so yes to make some

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,840
speaking together or even some cases I

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,550
was just honest split up a tree

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,560
maintenance that we ever could cause the

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,970
snow that day but we just can't comes on

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,900
academia and trust make a decision

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,490
please now for us

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,800
which is

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,050
for me because nobody will get hurt if

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,390
you say be justice eclis but we know we

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,969
compare take balls race but we need an

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,099
extra somebody who makes a decision sets

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,899
not said bad so yes this was a single

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,930
bed a box at the head

00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:45,680
I think you all know that but normal

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:48,410
case is a committee of a beta and yeah

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,930
so we had this one I don't think we had

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,580
any of such kind ever before since the

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,830
committee was set up which means since

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,209
it was about suit and so cups yep

00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:05,870
another one in tripped in years or you

00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:08,000
could warranty now and office so what we

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,510
can say about the TC work is it's about

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,250
disagreements and conflicts it's at the

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,920
broad technical level one thing we can

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:20,690
say that we are not all kernel hackers

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,459
I don't code in C all day if at all it's

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,430
about listening to what people have to

00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:27,110
say I had initially written that

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,730
sentence by saying talking to people

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,910
they are actually less talking and more

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,670
listening sometimes taking hard

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,070
decisions we are one of the bodies with

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:42,440
some powers in the DEP in Constitution

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:44,660
and it's essentially political so the

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,350
required skills skill sets alright we

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,630
are looking for is people with empathy

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,920
technical agility the ability to take a

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,589
look at the problem you haven't seen

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,700
before and take a distant look and

00:09:54,589 --> 00:10:00,140
global look at whether it's sane or not

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,800
someone that might that you might

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:06,550
consider as your mentor would be a good

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,660
person for to join the TC for example

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:12,170
we're also looking for people that are

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,959
reactive that can answer in males in

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:18,110
what we said one week at least read read

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:23,839
the males in one week some social

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:26,060
sensitivity and cool-headed it is

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,250
crucial for the TC to be representative

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,209
of the developers we are really trying

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,970
to expand to have the TC be an accurate

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:37,420
representation of everyone that is

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,050
acting in the project it used to be

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,209
Northern America

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:44,149
white males it has changed to some

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:47,690
extent native English speaker I think we

00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:58,399
had at least one a long term TC member

00:10:47,690 --> 00:11:02,720
who so yeah we're looking for to become

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,279
more diverse so we need nominees one of

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,250
our problems is that we have multiple

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:09,829
calls for TC nominees and we didn't have

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,170
like 25 people amongst which we could

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:15,079
pick it was hard for us to get enough

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,329
nominees so nominate yourself if you

00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:19,430
feel it's interesting for you or could

00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:21,700
be interesting for the project nominate

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,320
anyone you could see at that position

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,660
because they might not have thought of

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,329
nominating themselves and being

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,760
nominated by someone else can make this

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:34,010
person also wonder well I hadn't thought

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,899
about that before but okay it might be

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:40,940
interesting and come talk to us if you

00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,880
have worries questions or else that are

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,920
about the TCC itself issues in front of

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,020
the TC or whether you might be

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,790
interested to work with in or with us

00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,980
within the TCC with us

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,450
we're just developers this as I said

00:11:51,980 --> 00:12:00,380
before we're not special in any way and

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:01,820
we're here to help um so in particular

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,610
now I'd like to save it

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:09,920
I think it's better if you contact the

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:11,810
TC at a point where you're still engaged

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,670
in the process where you're still

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,070
constructively engaged with all the

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:19,880
parties then where you're so frustrated

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:22,430
you're no longer talking that ya know I

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,750
mean you know if you're going to be able

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,870
to work things out and you don't need us

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,730
that's great but we would rather get

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,140
involved at a point where people are

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:34,190
starting to realize hey this is thorny

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:38,240
then at a point where I'm never talking

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,920
to that other person again that said if

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,130
we have to get involved in a situation

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,140
where you're willing to talk to us but

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,360
you know communicating with some of the

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,640
other parties is challenging we'll deal

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,519
with that but we would have rather been

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,230
involved sooner I think

00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:58,260
it's certainly easier to do it and have

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:07,470
the decision at the end be something

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:25,670
that we're all happy with one thing that

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:25,670
I think is when I did all the bugs so

00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:31,470
before turning up here you know it's

00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,600
very easy to say well there some sort of

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,300
gods that we go to in supplication to

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,490
sort out our problems the thing that

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,690
becomes instantly apparent when you're

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,820
sitting on this side of the table is

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,040
that if there's an argument that's going

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:48,149
on long enough for people to start

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,740
spilling blood then the subject experts

00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:50,279
are definitely not on this side of the

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,850
table

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:56,160
they just don't agree so when they have

00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,230
to explain to us what's going on it's

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,720
gonna take some time because we're

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,120
coming to the party late and they've are

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,459
already carrying so many assumptions

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,319
with them you must know this because

00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,180
I've been concentrating on it two years

00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:13,410
everybody must have learned about it

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:15,600
well probably we don't so if you leave

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:18,060
the situation to go sour enough so it's

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,199
gonna be ruled on by the technical

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,569
committee there's pretty good chance

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,000
that it won't actually it won't be

00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,040
completely clear to us instantly that

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,630
you're right and that means you've got a

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,819
good chance of not getting what you want

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,620
so if you can sort it out yourselves

00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:34,410
first great if you want to come to us

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,550
and have it mediated so that you don't

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,480
have to start stabbing one another

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,480
that's even better

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,790
I'm out for I'll just continue and then

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,470
we can have the lively discussion all

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:52,690
also about that but I have more slides

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,820
not many about the recruiting process

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,250
we're also looking into ways to improve

00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,350
it because we have announcements we

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:03,130
didn't really announce the time span and

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,500
we are looking into announcing something

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,450
like the DPL election saying this is the

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,430
period where we expect nominations this

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,830
is the period where we will run the

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:15,040
internal discussions and vote and then

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,899
we expect the DPL to be able to have the

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,339
decision by that date and if we don't

00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,500
have enough candidates and we just wait

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,430
another year and we run another session

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,399
something like that

00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:30,220
it's not being decided so we are having

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:33,870
informal and internal discussions mostly

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:36,459
on IRC and by discussing busy trousers

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,560
one very important thing that has

00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:41,560
improved that is not perfect yet is the

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,620
TCC responsiveness both internally and

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,959
externally how we respond to males just

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,790
males on the bugs and how we are

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:53,470
progressing together towards resolution

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:55,240
on some issues also we're discussing our

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,329
ability to pick options in a timely

00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,209
manner for some of the past issues it

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:04,000
would have been beneficial to pick any

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,680
of the available options and picking any

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,890
of the two options will have been better

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,170
than letting the time go and not picking

00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:13,300
even if the picked option wouldn't have

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:17,560
been the best but picking is better than

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,420
not picking and we are wondering about

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,870
the amount of issues we don't have any

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:25,529
other than recruiting currently so we

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:28,329
currently have few issues to solve and

00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:30,450
we're wondering if this is in any way an

00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:33,310
indicator of the health of the project

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,930
if people are not having conflicts is

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,820
maybe they are not talking to each

00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,100
others or no one is doing anything

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,970
anymore or it's just that everything's

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,470
happened smoothly

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,600
we don't know and we are also kind of

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,699
worried about the time we spend on

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,709
recruitment having to find one or two

00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:53,170
members per year and not having any

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:58,120
other issues than that is not really

00:16:53,170 --> 00:17:01,240
to work for the TC to conduct so that

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,449
said we are now to the point for a QA

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,880
open discussion we started to dive in

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:13,000
some of the things already but the stage

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:20,470
is yours or we can have another coffee

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:25,240
break any questions it's nice a

00:17:20,470 --> 00:18:03,370
questions or nominations just go to

00:17:25,240 --> 00:18:06,040
poster then you can see I mean that is

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:10,809
because the last year is fine I started

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:14,280
with some so so how many nominations did

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,280
you get four relax

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:24,270
we've got I remember correctly I think

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:28,260
we got seven about amongst a seven yeah

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:31,950
but I think it's also I wish we would

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,350
choose to disclose how many accepted yes

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,660
all but one of the seven mole I think

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,060
most didn't accept yeah so we have

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,700
lineup is very few candidates enough

00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:54,180
sauce yeah we had yeah you find it

00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:57,810
minutes to pick someone up running in

00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,580
early in terms of actual time commitment

00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:02,820
I I don't think we touched on that but

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,340
we're looking at about an hour wait so

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,610
it's not the huge time commitment of

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,190
course if you know something huge

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,020
happens then that might explode but in

00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,570
general we're we're not looking for

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:20,760
somebody to have this as you know a 25%

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:22,710
job yeah I mean you just need to be able

00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,710
to keep up with a male and and and oh

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,440
and or if it's the times when you're not

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,870
keeping up dude especially do not both

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,040
be able to keep up and then raise

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,340
last-minute objections

00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,210
that's Wow does that you know get

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,210
frustrating quickly

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,170
sounds like it's an interesting balance

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,490
between the cool-headed in this aspect

00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:55,620
everything cool down a bit

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:59,100
it's working two things basically it's

00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:01,800
just what Alicia said I mean Gigi amazed

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,710
and answer in a timely manner that's all

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,810
because both us and also what seems that

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,520
it's not helpful if if you get mail and

00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,560
we can't get an answer because nobody

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,810
reads email is in one or two months so

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,810
yes did you male answer to it if you

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,340
have questions ask questions nobody says

00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,500
you need to responders in five minutes

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,350
but being normally able to respond to

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,280
mail it in a week might be quite helpful

00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,590
it was also the question of

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,070
acknowledgement is that we as a body

00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,690
have to progress together towards common

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,390
understanding of what the problem is and

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,220
what possible solution could be and our

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,040
responsiveness problems were like

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,260
someone spent some time writing a long

00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,940
mail about his findings etcetera and

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,860
gets basically no acknowledgement

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,570
because we all act as we all act in on

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,420
mailing lists like we don't send one

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:51,930
mail saying plus one or I agree which is

00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:54,270
as a body something we now seem to need

00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:57,510
because then you write this long mail

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,950
and you don't you need a way to see that

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:04,890
the rest of the body actually agrees

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:06,210
with you or disagrees with you well yeah

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,810
baby yeah we're just discussing that

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:12,650
right now it's actually going to be plus

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,650
one mails roughly

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,430
about the third questions by the

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:27,470
microphones video sakura is there and I

00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:30,460
think Anna has the next several years if

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,840
I don't remember who who proposed this

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,240
some people that have run for detail

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,970
have a particular as part of their

00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,740
platform they would call for a Social

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,390
Committee because well the Technical

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,420
Committee should be published and a

00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:47,390
technical work but well now you say that

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:50,960
a big part of your work is actually

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:54,110
social so I mean it's not so much of a

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,470
question the answer is obvious but maybe

00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:59,570
for the more long-running people among

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,430
you what do you think that led to that

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,460
impression to somebody that was running

00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:08,210
for a DPL I'm not speculating other

00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:13,450
people's DPL platforms especially if

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:15,800
recorded but otherwise I mean really I

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,360
mean we are not safe if I he takes off

00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,730
their bimbo tracks that's not what we

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,680
are that's not what we are good at some

00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:26,660
of us might be she fire text in our work

00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:27,980
but that something is so and it might

00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,290
mean it's not roof post for the

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:33,440
committee and as some of you know I've

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:35,390
been long-term the DC member Bowser

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,340
it's not that you have make find it a

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,110
great taking a decision so Alberto says

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,090
oh yes so it's really quiet you never

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,280
have thought of it but people come to

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,050
you with problems so say oh we don't

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,760
know how to do it we don't know how this

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,770
I'll see back to fix we have a

00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,050
disagreement about the maintenance that

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,790
does do we can accept the page is to

00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,680
this skin then what you don't do is you

00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:56,570
don't go and say oh yeah I look at the

00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,430
page and my decision final decision is

00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,900
this is much faster okay why do you

00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,670
believe it's this very valuing since as

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,470
belief the other way and come to another

00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,630
side which L body makes hippie so it's

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,130
lots about speaking it's necessary to be

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,780
able to understand the technical things

00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,040
behind because if you say oh Petros is

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,410
it it doesn't help

00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,210
obviously but so it's more about

00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:18,140
speaking with people about technical

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:20,390
issues and sets basically again and all

00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,200
upset let's say high-level thing he does

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,910
things in Debian

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,740
you need to make sure that people speak

00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,450
to each other so yes this is something

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,990
show three parts a social thing about

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,330
how

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,030
to get on technically it's not about oh

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,550
I was feeling as somebody was almost

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:37,130
treating me unfairly last night at small

00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:40,190
games or now I need some whatever that's

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,690
not not our proposed but if I don't

00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,670
understand if I have always my pictures

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,820
are diffused yes please come to us

00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:49,610
that's one of our duties I think we also

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,929
changed our understanding as members we

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,840
also changed our understanding what the

00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:56,600
TC work is and it we are I think

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,100
progressing towards more that's also why

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,440
it reflects in the skill set we're

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:04,220
looking for it's also very much social

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,050
work and we're going in that direction

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,300
which makes the idea of a social

00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,850
committee kind of useless because we

00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,410
become that basically well we are our

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,260
understanding moves into that direction

00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:18,100
I mean we will never be ah

00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:22,990
a committee that decides on like

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:25,880
balancing social like balancing saying

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,170
non technical aspects of balancing our

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,590
users versus the free software community

00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:32,360
but because but but when it has a

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:36,470
technical implication we can give input

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:39,320
I also think that the entire Debian

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:42,380
project has over the last five to ten

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,840
years maybe even more and gained an

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,270
understanding that a lot of of the

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,880
problems which we're trying to fix are

00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,559
actually they're about communication

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,500
they're about the people they're much

00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:56,120
more about that than they are about

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,390
actually fixing a particular technical

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,580
problem so and and I think that it's

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,210
it's basically just a reflection of the

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,679
project as a whole more than it is a

00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,960
something that that the Technical

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:13,880
Committee has gone out and Donna on its

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,410
own this is yeah and purpose to say so

00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,770
example whenever the member platforms

00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:20,510
learning something in 2005/2006 rising

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,150
at very interesting discussions at these

00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:25,970
times we say DPA candidates more or less

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:27,290
attaining committee was let's say had a

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,890
few members who were not so active

00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,550
anymore

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,990
so we had a we had a hard time to get

00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,100
some to the sign from the committee

00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,929
because we could even couldn't get

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,850
enough votes for them to expel them from

00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:40,550
the committee anymore so that wasn't

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:45,260
fixed we had a few new per members edit

00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:49,280
that was Steve and me later on : s well

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:51,140
well and so we get to comedy form they

00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,900
don't even look at PacSun don't work -

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,060
yes now it works we'll solve some issues

00:25:53,900 --> 00:26:00,560
with it some some better some not as

00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:02,450
good i mean long-term observers could

00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,720
remember that but so we really got got

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,430
to committed to working again and back

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,160
at such time as he calls it was the

00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,660
first start of oh yes Depa isn't only

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,770
about taking your decision says

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:18,470
something is in which which also changed

00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:24,010
the way a DPL interact or some of the

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:27,980
DPL interacts we managed to get getting

00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:29,480
migrated form we have to see ftp masters

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,650
who occasionally always do the leases

00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,630
are just shout out

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,850
oh no it's flawless and released to

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,770
something like we have a released him

00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,500
now this multiple members so they've a

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:42,290
lot of changes in the project as a whole

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,390
I'm traveling or just pointing and just

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:46,550
painting a bit exaggerated picture of

00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,550
course but yes the project changed a lot

00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:57,830
in the last whatever ten years and I

00:26:49,550 --> 00:27:01,100
think in a good way anymore don't be a

00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,320
flight if you don't bite so and just to

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,940
say is a to hope to start some

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,130
discussion one thing we'd love to hear

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,110
about now or later is if there are

00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:10,880
things we ought to be looking at if

00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,210
there are issues that are starting to

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,230
boil up that maybe we should care about

00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,230
that would be a great thing to tell us

00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,370
no one has problems then continue a good

00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,780
work yeah I want to add what Zobel just

00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,120
say that it's not so much of a question

00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:32,090
but being on a technical committee seems

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,560
like an extremely thankless jobs I guess

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,770
I just want to say thank you for your

00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,770
hard work

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:52,000
there's one question there so in terms

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,130
of what you're saying if that now the

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,510
committee sees its role not purely as

00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,580
answering technical points but also

00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:01,030
thinking about the social factors behind

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,500
them do you think they can sender to be

00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:04,690
a contradiction between those two things

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,190
though because maybe on the technical

00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,900
side it could sometimes be that you can

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,810
write quickly say well this is the right

00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,550
time Sarah I know not on certain bugs

00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,320
but in some cases but it could be that

00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,650
there's actually a deeper social problem

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,960
that is the real issue at stake and that

00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,700
so I mean it's imagine somewhat one

00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,160
person is technically right but actually

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:27,310
they've been really socially bad in

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,500
pushing that side how do you see the the

00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:33,880
kind of deal between the two things to

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,830
sort out what would you well if there's

00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,330
an obvious technical correct solution

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,000
then one of our roles would be to

00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:42,280
socialize that appropriately and say yes

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,840
this person is being a total jerk but

00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,820
they actually are right right and that

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,260
would be that would be a responsibility

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,260
that we would have in that case is this

00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,060
is to is to balance the choose to

00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:54,010
technically technically correct solution

00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,500
but to socialize it in a way that people

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,480
can understand it can begin to accept it

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,100
that the separate the technically issue

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,110
from the social issue and solve them and

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,570
try to solve both of them in our in our

00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,890
response so whereas whereas you might

00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,120
think that the only thing we would say

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,980
is oh we're gonna pick the technically

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,200
correct solution no that that can't be

00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,030
the entire response it might be the

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,940
answer that we provide but the response

00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,890
needs to also acknowledge the social

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,510
issues going on and so that you would

00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,160
you would balance those two not by

00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,100
choosing the technically incorrect

00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:27,720
solution but by by having the response

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:34,090
acknowledge the social issues as well

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:36,460
and also I mean in lots of cases when

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,260
the conflict has been longer long says

00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,200
and there's some personal tension it's

00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:43,090
often easier to not get some answers

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,460
since the right solution for the person

00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,110
who is obviously to you pair but from

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,210
some independent body was said okay it's

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,299
we reviewed we heard all of the reasons

00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,159
for both sides and we came to a

00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:55,019
see that this looks better because this

00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,519
is that it's an easier to takes and of

00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:59,399
the person who was going on your nerves

00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:18,119
for whatever the last two years so that

00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:19,950
might also help I think if you've ever

00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,960
tried explaining why you've got a

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,700
tangley bug to someone and then just

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,739
fixed it I think that's also a role that

00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,989
we can have is that if there's an awful

00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:30,389
bug where neither side can agree and

00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:35,210
they explain it to us then one of them

00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:35,210
might go oh by never mind

00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:40,769
so I will say I have pondered standing

00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:48,570
for tech you know volunteer we take MIDI

00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:51,570
multiple times over the years but but it

00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:54,840
I think it well essentially yes no it's

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:57,509
it's one of the important things that I

00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:01,889
think we actually do need to spread and

00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:04,379
cover represent more of the body of of

00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:07,200
the Debian contributors in total I mean

00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:10,340
I'm one I'm one of the old guard as my

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,629
wife keeps on telling me I'm getting old

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,940
you know I've done all kinds of other

00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:17,190
jobs in Debian I think I could help but

00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,259
I would much rather see other people

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:23,700
with different experiences of viewpoints

00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:26,100
represented as well so I guess I have

00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,769
just kind of volunteered have no I would

00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,749
rather if you're desperate this year

00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:32,429
then yeah count me in but I would rather

00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:35,399
see all the people step up first

00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:36,869
I mean basically exactly what I said

00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,119
when I volunteered because there was

00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:40,769
only one the was it second or third call

00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:45,779
for volunteers having thought about it

00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:54,899
six months wearing a skirt that's almost

00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:57,299
diverse but not really I mean so I kept

00:31:54,899 --> 00:32:02,580
me from wrong have we ever had a female

00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:05,070
TC we had we had multiple proposals of

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,139
females but I don't

00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,389
every one of them even accepted to be

00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:12,809
nominated s even think we had the same

00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:15,269
person more than once so yes I think

00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:17,610
they are well good female potential

00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:20,549
members of the committee however I don't

00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,470
agree to be yeah what can we do on the

00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:24,330
other hand if you think something like

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,130
said and I cannot fully understand that

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,539
you can all say I nominate myself but

00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:30,360
please the first someone from our

00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:33,570
different groups and me and me only last

00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,880
resort that's okay with us maybe then

00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:38,970
only picks a person if we have don't any

00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,309
other of acceptability nominees so I

00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:43,049
mean one thing to consider is that

00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:48,210
there's a lot of research that suggests

00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:49,980
that there are some groups that are that

00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:53,669
are more likely to self nominate than

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,629
other groups we find at least as a my

00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:56,879
understanding of the research we

00:32:54,629 --> 00:33:00,330
actually find the TC composition is very

00:32:56,879 --> 00:33:03,629
consistent with groups that are fairly

00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:05,340
commonly willing to sell nominate so one

00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:09,779
of my advice to people who are willing

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:11,759
to stand themselves but who would like

00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:14,340
to see more diversity is to go in

00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,799
addition to volunteering yourself um go

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,840
spend an hour to thinking about who

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,960
would be good candidates who would be

00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,850
more diverse and nominate them and

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,129
possibly even copy them on your

00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,950
nomination and let them know that you

00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:30,389
think they would be great and why

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:33,000
because sometimes that can actually be

00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:36,809
enough to help someone get over that

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,269
hump and accept a job this diversity

00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:40,860
thing is that is both our responsibility

00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:43,529
because we pick from the nominees but

00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,990
it's very much the responsibility of all

00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:49,590
the developers also to give us enough

00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:53,129
names and you all know more people than

00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:56,820
we also all know only and we need your

00:33:53,129 --> 00:34:00,210
ideas of people that would be good for

00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:03,269
the TC and think wild I mean anyone that

00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:05,490
that has interesting social skills into

00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:07,740
in discussions and online that you have

00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:11,399
to salt yeah well that's an interesting

00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,530
say thought that's a good way to to tone

00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:16,230
a conflict down well maybe just push

00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,110
them a little and dominate them for the

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,450
TC it

00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:22,880
just as a slight adjustment what Sandra

00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:24,110
said rather than see seeing the person

00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,730
that you're nominating I think you

00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,710
should tell us that you want to see see

00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:30,800
them because then people can opt out of

00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:33,740
being spamed about a thousand times by

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,300
everybody in the project having if so if

00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,220
they're what happen to be someone that

00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,170
says there's absolutely no circumstances

00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,840
under which I'm going to do it then

00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:44,060
having their mailbox filled is not gonna

00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,220
be helpful so we can just filter that so

00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,750
if you want to see see them don't say

00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,270
don't actually do it just say I'm very

00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:55,640
happy for this to be published to the

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:57,050
nominee and we'll do it actually I need

00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,270
to disagree a bit on that because

00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,920
basically the nominees match are not

00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,170
sent to the project mailing list but

00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,910
Raza to a private place because it's

00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,890
better specially for you could send your

00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:12,050
nomination to public lists but if you

00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:17,390
know me someone if someone is so so so

00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:19,460
yes but only if it's private mail just

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:23,180
to us as it works but I've seen the five

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:25,310
minute sign so I think we I think the

00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,110
good suggesters mail make sure that you

00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,820
know how many people you would like to

00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,350
see in the comment here also form a

00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,120
diversity point of view I think that's

00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:34,670
important thing is the other you see my

00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:47,020
pitiful with the firm but yeah do it

00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:47,020
like you think it's collect words

00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,110
so before we do the closing I would like

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,910
to thank you all for the trust that you

00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,890
had in me as member of the committees as

00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,210
now my last year here standing here next

00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:03,020
to average I've been happy to try and be

00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:05,960
Dane so thank you for the support that

00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:08,030
we got and Seth lasted at least most of

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,380
you had accessing I get less bad emails

00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,770
and other people's of the project in a

00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:15,680
decent decision but anyways so thank you
