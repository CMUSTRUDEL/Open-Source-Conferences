pictures from the fierce Cuba comp that

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:28,370
was on to the 2016 we have here the last

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:33,950
that was on November of last year last

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:37,640
year and we had the opportunity to to

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:40,600
have some Debian developers for instance

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:48,670
in 2016

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:53,030
Thiago bar Toledo Piazza the TSA cameras

Dasia yeah thank you Dasia went to to

00:12:53,030 --> 00:13:03,110
become and they they push it to create

00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:06,260
with Leonel salazar a cuban free

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:13,940
software developer to organize for the

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:15,800
first time the mini Def Con in Cuba from

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,040
the organization of the conference it is

projects as of its participants so the

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,149
participation of women

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,850
and minority groups in these activities

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:32,480
is crucial to build new inclusive spaces

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:34,610
of knowledge dialogue about technology

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,339
the main idea is to know people

experience and organizations who work

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:43,129
with wheat and in free software with all

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,850
hardware technologies and little or

00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:48,610
slowed bandwidth and to talk about how

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:54,110
free software can help in developing

00:13:48,610 --> 00:14:04,839
countries so event during the last Cuba

00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:08,660
comp we had a great number of girls and

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:11,329
participating which we told and even

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:18,709
attending the the event and thus was

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:20,449
very motivating we also had a talk of

00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:25,750
Molly the blank from the freezer

00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:29,930
foundation and she she did a very nice

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:39,189
presentation and and this is a group al

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:45,319
photo from last year so yes now I will

00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:54,860
talk about the mini Def Con during coop

00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:59,420
account 2016 this encounter between -

00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:03,139
Dacia and Tiago with Janelle and have

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:07,459
has push it - to organize for Feldstein

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:10,329
mini deaf come in in Cuba this this

00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:14,089
colleague is Janelle Salazar with us and

00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:18,079
he is one of the founders of util and

00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:23,360
Debian gnu/linux in Holguin he is a free

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:25,970
software users in since 2004 first I'm

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,509
using Debian gnu/linux was with charge

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,490
and he has been spreading the Debian

00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:34,550
project in local communities in Cuba and

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:39,100
organizing events as mini defconn's and

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,100
his programmer as profession

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:52,010
so during last-minute DEFCON we we had

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:58,100
some some topics like how about to help

00:15:52,010 --> 00:16:01,120
Debian project from from Cuba the Cuban

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:06,320
community share shared two main projects

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:11,110
where musics and video morph their

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:16,910
developers show it how how is

00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:17,540
development the the programs and how how

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,800
to use it

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,380
also I had the opportunity to to present

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:28,660
a talk about reproducible builds for

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:35,260
first time in Spanish and it was very

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:39,530
useful to attract to new Debian

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:43,840
enthusiast users and also to the

00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:48,650
currently developers like Michael and

00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:55,070
Oscar from video more on my socks it was

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:57,200
a new topic to start taking care with

00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,420
the principles of represent reponsible

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:04,070
built in the construction of the new

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:06,199
versions for their development

00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:13,430
developments with missiles and video

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:15,800
more so much of this work has been

00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,480
carried out by enthusiastic and

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,910
committed people with Debian and the

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,949
free software movement that despite the

00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,250
different difficulties to sustain some

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:27,500
cost economically access internet

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,810
acquired computer hardware and achieve

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,280
official recognition as developer of

00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:35,120
some free software community in the

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,980
world due to all the the both they

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,130
continued to contribute in a decisive

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,950
way projects that should be available to

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,890
everyone inside and outside of Cuba

00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:51,380
because for instance mystics project

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:55,150
video more and many other programs that

00:17:51,380 --> 00:18:01,940
hosted in the wrapper go tool by the

00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:08,020
limitations of hardware money a bi-level

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:12,650
just to the to the to a cuban users so

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:15,039
in that in that in that way i I

00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,950
considered that it could be very

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:24,830
interesting and important to think about

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:27,320
how the Debian project in full support

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,630
and recognize those who contribute

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,960
directly to the use and development of

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,720
our distribution in places where there

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,330
are there is the wildness to do so and

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,750
strange to our community by being

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:46,940
inclusive of them because we know that

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:52,539
we have Debian social contract we have

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:59,929
our guidelines but how can we how can we

00:18:52,539 --> 00:19:03,409
consider to those that are in a country

00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:05,030
in which all of you you could connect to

00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:08,059
the internet but it's very expensive

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:10,309
and if you want to interact by the

00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:13,039
mailing list or you want to stay in

00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:16,190
contact with another variant maintainer

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:20,539
or Debian developers it is not so easy

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:25,130
because you seem simply you don't have

00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:30,620
the the conditions so I want to I want

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:34,730
to set the the question to to have a

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:38,990
dialogue and and to see what do you

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:42,559
think what which possibilities are since

00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:46,059
the Debian project to support for

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,669
instance the missile development that is

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:53,059
based on Debian and even the packages

00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:59,659
could be in the in the repositories in

00:19:53,059 --> 00:20:02,450
the free section well this is this is

00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:04,570
all and thank you very much for for your

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:09,329
attention

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,329
[Applause]

00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,060
any comments or questions

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:42,900
now it is on the me sucks distribution

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,150
is is it registered with the derivative

00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,470
census - do you know if they already

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:51,240
collaborate with Debian in that way

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:54,090
first thing that come to my mind

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,570
yes no the missile development is

00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:01,140
driving just by by the local developers

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:06,320
in Cuba by Michael Daley oh and Alberto

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:09,960
but they have not done contact with some

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:14,580
Debian developers outside outside you

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:18,120
are then then that would be my my first

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:21,660
suggestion is for them to to just inform

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,750
Debian in a in a relatively formalized

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,450
way what is is they are doing how it

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,250
derives from Debian how is it different

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,320
that is a helpful thing for me and I

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,200
believe also for others in Debian and

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,440
and outside of Debian to compare and

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:41,280
then get inspiration of what would be

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,200
interesting to piggyback cherry-pick put

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,620
into Debian and what would be important

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,860
to to coordinate so the very reference

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,980
of they exist in a more formal way it's

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,500
not a lot of work it's just a weak page

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,100
to to inform who to contact how to

00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,980
contact

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:02,610
I remember once looking at me socks web

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,820
page and trying to navigate and I I was

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:08,640
lost in in locating who should I even

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,260
contact how is it structured and that's

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,750
partly of course because I don't

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,030
understand Spanish

00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:19,049
so that helps that's that's one barrier

00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:21,360
for me personally but but there could be

00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:24,270
other things also in how do they put the

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,299
information for their own users how to

00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:29,840
present it for Debian collaborators okay

00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,840
thank you

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,529
[Music]

00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,260
everybody else

00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:57,270
why is it I just want to ask how you

00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:04,460
yourself related to the Cuban community

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:10,170
I just I just been in contact with

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:13,440
Psalms developers like linear Michael

00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:19,890
Daley because the Cuba comp and the mini

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:26,520
deathtome and I just have this knowledge

00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:29,130
but beyond than this I I don't I don't

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,280
know if there are even more more

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:38,490
projects that are in the underground

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:42,090
more than than this so yes this is the

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:53,100
only contact that I have with the Cuban

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:54,660
developers of free software could you do

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,680
you know what can you tell a little bit

00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:00,540
more about the kinds of barriers that I

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,880
understand the one of it is expensive so

00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:06,270
technically possible to get online but

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,430
breathe but other other kinds of

00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:11,280
barriers is that is that a wall like in

00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,990
China or what kind of barriers is there

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,350
for the developers in two parts who

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:19,560
collaborate with others in Indian okay

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:23,490
in my opinion I considered that the main

00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:26,400
barrier is to to pay to connect to

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:30,030
internet because you know in free

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,120
software movement always the connection

00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:39,810
to a network has been very important to

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:43,350
to stay in touch with another developers

00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:46,440
or interested users so in the case of in

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:50,760
Cuba they have an intranet but if they

00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:56,940
want to to socialize their programs

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:59,350
outside that the island is it's a matter

00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,230
of to pay

00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:09,100
for instance five cook that is more or

00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:13,000
less for euro pair five hours of

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,700
Internet and not always the connection

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,640
is is good because you need to talk to

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,510
public parks or you need to go to some

00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:26,380
[Music]

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:29,770
monument or a public place in which

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:35,020
there are access point and then you use

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:37,840
your card and try to get an IP but this

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,350
is really hard in some times you could

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,730
wait until 2025 minutes because there

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:48,120
are a lot of people with smartphones or

00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:51,880
smaller devices and even if you are even

00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:55,510
my personal situation when I was in Cuba

00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:58,690
I tried to connect to the network and I

00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:03,370
delay around 35 40 minutes to get an IP

00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:07,830
to my to my computer so in the first

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:12,280
this is the main obstacle to cool

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:17,080
communicate with another people outside

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:20,680
using internet by other hand the

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:24,310
hardware because the weather conditions

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:27,040
in you are it's very very hot so and

00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:32,230
they do not have air conditioning

00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:35,940
systems to maintain community projects

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:41,410
or self self-driven

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:45,190
servers unless you you are working in

00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:47,710
some institution or in the government or

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:50,710
in the university maybe you could you

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:54,790
could have a chance to host the your

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:58,270
your project in a local computer and

00:26:54,790 --> 00:27:01,360
then use a public IP maybe but if you

00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:06,070
you are not working in in these fields

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:09,790
of the technology in Cuba is very hard

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:11,910
if you are independent user and you just

00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:17,500
want to contribute and

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:22,180
and let they let it know to more people

00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:24,730
about your project you need to to

00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,640
connect to the network and you need to

00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:34,000
pay also because internet is not it's

00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:36,580
not money is not money free in Cuba I

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,400
was also thinking in like that the kinds

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:43,390
of tools so if you know if you noticed

00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,520
but so is it like a does it feel from

00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,980
the perspective of Cubans does it feel a

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,950
social for Debian developers to be

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:55,900
hanging out on IRC so they need to be on

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:58,120
real online or is it so today would it

00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,520
be more beneficial to them if some of us

00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,580
is using mail more or mailing list more

00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:05,740
or IRC more forums more would is there

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,620
some patterns you have noticed in the

00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:11,920
styles of communication that could be

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:15,010
helpful for this kind of barriers yes I

00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:19,240
think that if that will be possible if

00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:23,800
the human developer school at least use

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:27,760
IRC and communicate with some Debian

00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:33,180
maintainer or developers maybe will will

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:38,350
be interchange of knowledge or they

00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:39,400
could be they could learn more from from

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:44,890
from you

00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:50,050
and also you could take their their

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:53,320
packages into some yield lab server or

00:28:50,050 --> 00:29:00,340
you could be some kind of sponsor of

00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:04,050
Debian sponsor - to be - yes - to be in

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,050
public - cool

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:13,320
allow the public access outside of Cuba

00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:16,240
this software for instance kneesocks or

00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:19,690
another one from from repulsion and

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,710
maybe you could help in that way about

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,770
the the Cuban the Cuban developer needs

00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,370
to - con

00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:35,330
- another work - could be in constant

00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:39,110
communication you know what is the best

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:41,480
place to learn about events in Debian

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:44,990
related events in Cuba in case I have

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,110
any way over the Atlantic and I think oh

00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:50,690
could I pass by Cuba and second question

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:55,550
do you know whether there are any

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:57,679
problems to go to the US but via Cuba or

00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:03,470
going from the u.s. to Cuba and then

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:07,690
back to Europe I think there are some

00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:13,040
restrictions for United States citizens

00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:19,429
to visit Cuba unless you do argument

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:24,620
some research or education houses but if

00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:27,710
you if you are coming from Europe it's

00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:31,510
no problem I think there is no

00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:34,580
restriction for European citizen or

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:39,260
Latino and Latin American citizens or

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:43,700
Asian - to be in Cuba - to work with

00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:46,850
with technology topics with the local

00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,470
people and how to learn about events are

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,140
human mailing list or something like

00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:54,100
that

00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:57,510
not a mailing this but there is a

00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:00,559
reputed website there is

00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:00,559
[Music]

00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:30,490
is here this this is the this is the

00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:35,770
main the main group in which you could

00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:42,580
stay in contact with the Cuban community

00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:47,890

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:58,120
group website this is a general the

00:31:52,210 --> 00:32:05,970
general way of communicate with the more

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:13,060
active Cuban developers also of the the

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:17,950
alt of the some there are some projects

00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:20,130
that are hosted in in github like video

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,130
more

00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,910
and

00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,910
[Music]

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,200
here are the the contact of some of the

00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,830
developers but this is very particular

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,940
do you need to know the name of the of

00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:54,570
the program because you know in in

00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,450
replica tool there are more than 50 at

00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:01,470
least different programs many of them

00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:04,260
are developed by the same guy but by

00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:08,370
other hand there are another ones that

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:14,730
even doesn't have a get heat lab or

00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:18,390
github server and in this case is the

00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:22,230
better way is to do it by the the go

00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:28,530
tool the G utl website to contact with

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:34,549
the community of the developers of free

00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:34,549
software in Cuba in yes definitely

people building their their own ad hoc

00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,240
network in countries in which Internet

00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:10,829
is not were connected for instance using

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:14,730
the Babel Protocol and we'd be possible

00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:16,800
to to use to build your own connection

00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:23,820
to Internet using that kind of

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:26,520
technology okay well I
