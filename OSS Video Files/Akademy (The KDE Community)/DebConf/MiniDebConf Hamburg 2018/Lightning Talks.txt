	00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:10,869
right good afternoon it is the lightning

00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:15,119
talk session at the miniature debconf

00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:17,890
amber 2018 we've got seven speakers and

00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,960
I guess we'll just get going

00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:31,210
starting with two Bs platen talking

00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:35,980
about debian on power 9 I know on Friday

00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:43,289
I received my new power 9 machine

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:49,780
tireless 9 and it has an IBM power 9

00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:56,530
closes oh so see only this or that I

00:00:49,780 --> 00:01:01,510
know that will work is Debian since this

00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:06,960
is a new PowerPC 64-bit architecture

00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:12,600
that can run in little-endian mode I

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:18,390
downloaded a Debian installer first I

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:25,230
chose the stable version but that crash

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:29,260
during install and then I read write a

00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:35,190
different version a daily version and

00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:40,570
this one which is based on Buster

00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:44,140
correctly installs I can even have a

00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:48,670
graphical environment working out of the

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:54,430
box and the Installer still complains

00:01:48,670 --> 00:02:01,450
that is no boot partition for older

00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:06,700
power pcs and this boot partition is not

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:12,430
needed since the Talos 2 and as a newer

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:19,080
systems starting with power7 use petite

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:23,500
port so that needs to be

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:27,970
fixed in the Debian installer that it

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:35,680
doesn't put your warning on power

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:54,040
machines and now I have working Debian

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:55,359
installation which I can use thank you

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,879
very much that was very quick

00:02:55,359 --> 00:03:03,660
next up is Timothy Joe Swan talking

00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:03,660
about moving the XMPP social platform

00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,670
give him a moment to get set up

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,970
I think it's a bit better this way

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:42,240
who already heard about the platform

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:45,180
movem okay so we have a couple of people

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,190
that knows about the project here just

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,690
to present you what actually could be a

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,380
priority universe but it's actually the

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,690
current universe we are living with lots

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,040
of different chats platform so same

00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:01,860
thing on the social network

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:03,630
we keep reinventing the wheel we don't

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,400
have this problem with emails hopefully

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,250
actually the email standards came way

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,920
before all those as a proprietary

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,410
solution so we have one salon and Google

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,500
and Microsoft are still using SMTP IMAP

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,270
and for now so everything is compatible

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,130
and then we just have a lot of clients

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,950
on top of that but for chat and for

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,110
social network is not the case so the

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:31,040
idea of mobium is to build a social

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:33,900
platform in bare we can put a little

00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,970
couple of ingredients first is need to

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,650
be a open source for the transparency

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,800
for the fact that you can have feedback

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,740
and improvement for a security part so

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,260
bring some trust I think you guys here

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,700
knows about the advantages of free

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:52,380
software especially on the communication

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,020
part a social network but it's not

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,450
enough we also need to bring control

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,550
actually in this social network so it

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,280
need to be simple and transparent on the

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:07,770
UI but also on the protocol level on the

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:09,240
really deep in deep below on stacks you

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,430
need to have a strong and reliable

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,200
encryption so don't reinvent also an

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,170
encryption

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,660
talking about telegram here and yeah I

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,580
need to have some trust inside so having

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,240
a community and not only a company that

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,680
you will blindly trust to take care of

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,940
all your communication but it's not

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,950
enough you need to be decentralized

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,300
because a centralized social network

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,580
even if it's open source if it's only

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,080
one and stands you have to still trust

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,490
and sense so you would like to deploy

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,100
your instance you would like to trust

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,650
someone else you can only sometime trust

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,120
only yourself in some cases

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,930
the socialization also bring your

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,150
business your business yeah we are

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,650
really so that made it meant to me

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,250
anytime that actually one server is

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,190
failing

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,100
I think single have an issue recently

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,810
about this kind of thing they are at

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,140
issue with their Amazon server the whole

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,640
things didn't work for a couple of hours

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,950
and then resists again since I'm ship

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,170
control same thing with telegram I think

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,940
in Russia at the moment I'm talking more

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,070
about the I am part but it's also can be

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,080
applied a social network Park is exactly

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,320
same thing just as the information that

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,430
are exchanged are a bit different so you

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,920
need these steps but all those platform

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:30,540
here if anything is that actually I made

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:33,150
these conferences three years ago and I

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,920
just added my student and now recently

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:42,080
but actually yeah we still have like

00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:44,880
this big yeah difference of platforms

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,530
that it's there is communication with

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,180
the platform so there is an external

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,890
that are starting to come in as

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,740
especially between Jesper on my son but

00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,810
there is still a lot of work to do there

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,030
so at the secret thing Union is about

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,410
compatibility about extensibility don't

00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,700
try to reinvent the wheel again and

00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,500
don't try to create another social

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,300
network rounders I mean platform that

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,830
will have all those communication

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,520
troubles so having a long term vision

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:11,070
and this actually secret ingredient is

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,100
the standardization in these things so

00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,620
these secret ingredients should add a

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,500
couple of yeah this turned out actually

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,030
if you have a like a couple of features

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,950
support news feeds communities I am

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,510
chatroom presences know who is your

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:28,260
lying to profile the video conferencing

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:32,700
to security Bridget to the web and then

00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:34,290
need to be real time and one minute yeah

00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,840
this protocol actually exists its

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:39,330
colleagues MPP so the goal of the

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,270
project is to actually take XMPP

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,430
implement it and doing a lot of

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,590
innovation on top of the project so

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,080
server side is as simple XMPP clients

00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:52,440
web server super simple to install PHP

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,660
MySQL per sq L and on the user side is

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,120
also really super simple to use and

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,820
simply a browser to do that

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,410
is responsive it's light is fast and

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,440
it's built actually for small

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,150
communities there is pulse re all around

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,010
the world and you are really invited to

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,140
deploy your own pots there is a real

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,630
10,000 icons are registered on the

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,240
fishing port 30 languages Debian package

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:19,160
coming soon thanks to the help of people

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,120
some people in this room and that's it

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,920
yeah so if you want more information

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:30,960
everything is on the website and you can

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:31,800
join the trash room or the Twitter thank

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,440
you very much

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,820
next up is Thomas Langan mystify talking

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,820
about Brackett

00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:03,300
yeah today I'm not talking about five

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,960
but about Draycott Draycott is

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:11,970
replacement for in a dram FS which is

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:14,820
used by most other distributions if I'm

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,610
correct only Ubuntu and Debian and the

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,160
divert ifs are using in a gram of s

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:24,089
tools are all other distributions

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,029
already moved to Draycott and today I

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,250
want to show how you can get an

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:32,580
experience with Draycott without the

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:35,580
installing in a drama fest tools ben

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,760
hutchison did some patches I think two

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,350
years ago so it's possible so what you

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,450
have to do there's a package called

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:47,400
record car which does not conflict

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:56,640
within the drama fest tools and I have a

00:10:47,400 --> 00:11:01,740
virtual machine so fine so on this

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:06,390
machine I will now install the Draycott

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,830
pit and Draycott core package and that's

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:14,520
it

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:20,400
we still have one in it Rd and now I can

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:32,480
say Dre cuts around first I have to copy

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:38,820
the to a tray cut version and then I can

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:43,800
generate a new init Rd with Dre cut tray

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:46,740
cut uses the usual hooks or module

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,950
system it does not use the hooks from

00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,800
the inner DRAM FS things but it already

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,510
includes a lot of hooks so for example

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,900
if you have a crypt set up you do not

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,850
need the Crypt setup hooks then the

00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:04,230
hooks for intagram FF tools from the

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:07,710
setup package because Draycott already

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:11,220
includes this and a lot of other things

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:13,950
after generating a new in it Rd you

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:17,670
update your group and you see we have

00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:20,610
now two entries in the graph so one with

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:24,209
the old in it Rd which was created by

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,279
the default one is the the inert Rd

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:29,160
which is created by intagram FS tools

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:33,899
and here you have the boot entry for the

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:42,020
new Draycott in it Rd and it boots up

00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:46,560
and works so what what what we need is

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:49,589
that's more people are using and giving

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,980
it a try so in your environment on your

00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:55,740
heart where does Drake at work and we

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,620
have a discussion like five years ago

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,520
if debian or when will Debian switch

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,350
from intagram FS to its - - Dre cut and

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,720
still there's no real need because in a

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,209
dram FS tool works for everybody but I

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,630
think in the long term we will switch it

00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:14,940
so please help us right

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:18,700
buck reports or just give it a try if it

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:22,470
works for you or not that's it

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,880
[Applause]

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:29,310
thank you very much next up is tech kids

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,310
talking about their organization

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:23,510
so okay those of you who attend that the

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,820
school Young's talk already heard about

00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:30,190
tickets I want to give a few details

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:32,660
about what what else we do tickets is a

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:37,640
nonprofit organization based in Germany

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:43,190
but we are working working on we're

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:45,860
working internationally and yeah we are

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,860
completely bata centered around a free

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,390
software and we do basically everything

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,030
concerning free software in education

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:56,660
and in the context of children and

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:59,900
adolescents and people more than 50% of

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,300
our active members are - there's an S

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:06,800
missing sorry um there are of course not

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:11,540
minor but they are minors and sorry kids

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,400
if you are watching there - and we are a

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:17,510
fully democratic organization like in

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,640
the Faust spirit and the most important

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,440
thing is that we get children involved

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,350
with all the parts of the organization

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,870
both operational and tutoring in

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,990
workshops and working with free software

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,910
projects giving presentations normally

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,190
some children would be here but as this

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:38,060
conference was right in the middle of

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,740
the school time this was not so easy so

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,260
what do we do first of all we want to

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,270
get children and interested in in in

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,730
programming in coding in technical stuff

00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:49,280
but and also in in free software this we

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,810
do by running youth programs at free

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,320
software conferences like the frost con

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:57,980
where normally around 100 to 120

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,570
children attend and yeah use Debian and

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,190
all that cool stuff and learn what they

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,190
can do with with it

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:09,350
we do peer learning so those children

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,540
who already know many things and are

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:15,110
very interested they get starts tutoring

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:18,140
other children these workshops of course

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,960
we have Nantes fun together we are

00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,480
outside there is a social program with

00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,670
staying overnight having a barbeque and

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,910
all that's all that stuff that helps me

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:32,220
community those who are even more

00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:35,090
interested can get actively involved in

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:38,100
preparing workshops organizing events

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:41,700
preparing talks looking at open source

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,770
projects helping others get free like

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,650
like a free messenger instead of

00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:50,240
whatsapp working on how to how to spread

00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:52,740
the word among youth and all of that and

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,390
then with that conference and raise

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,240
awareness this is our presentation team

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,070
from the Chemnitz linux days and they

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,290
are presenting the whole canon of free

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,840
software education at our school KY

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:10,490
booth with this school free in

00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:13,110
germinates and they are presenting all

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:17,910
projects that are involved in this in

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:21,420
this in this common booth and and care

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:23,090
for free software education if you're

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,290
interested in that maybe because you

00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:30,870
have children or want to have children

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:33,060
or higher education in some way yes

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,070
there are quite a few things that's that

00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,940
you can do you can have working on

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:42,200
projects you can have and work at with

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:45,510
mentoring the children in coding or

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,610
organizational activities you can have

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:50,280
spreading the word also raising

00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:54,480
awareness that many many software

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:57,990
projects do do have some involvement

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,930
with children even indirectly like web

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,430
browser like like Firefox they such such

00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,780
applications are used by children and

00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,030
they may have other needs and they may

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,650
have other views on that so it's very

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,850
important to at least think about what

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,590
what children or all schools are

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:18,480
teachers as well do with the software

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:21,270
part one may thank you we need help in

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,620
with presentations at conferences so not

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:27,930
every time the same people have to get a

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,850
get a day off at work and travel to

00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:33,720
conferences there is much more manpower

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:36,210
needed and of course every every NGO

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,200
every nonprofit organization is lacking

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,789
money so if you have already to donate

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,950
to Debian and still have money left you

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:49,409
might want to give your money to the

00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:52,110
Future which is children okay

00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:54,059
don't forget donating to Debian so maybe

00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:58,679
I don't know if I am shot if I don't say

00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:02,669
this okay and there's never a pay it's a

00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:04,110
free free donation platform just have a

00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:04,830
look at it if you want and if you want

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,659
to help us

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:10,080
actively just go to our website find

00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:12,210
some communication means or just talk to

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,750
someone you find at any conference who

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:40,620
was wearing this this shirt with thank

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:49,919
you up is Thomas cough talking about

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:51,539
containers ready almost ready we do have

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:57,480
one more space at the end if anybody

00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:59,450
feels you know inspired to tell us all

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:08,250
the things I mean we did have one very

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:09,250
very last minute sign up we've got one

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,509
more space

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,509
[Music]

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,900
meanwhile I guess I can make

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,850
announcements while I'm here front desk

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,160
will be available get again after lunch

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,820
as well t-shirts anybody who hasn't had

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,740
a t-shirt yet basically if you signed up

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:41,060
you're allowed to get a t-shirt come see

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:42,350
me yes free of charge come see me at

00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,310
front desk when it's open again after

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,930
lunch because I do you know some people

00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:55,100
have been reticent to come up and you

00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:57,890
know ask her once I could I I've

00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:07,790
probably given effectively a lightning

00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:10,910
talk I'm not giving here we go

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:14,420
Hines fight okay hello I'm Thomas Scott

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:16,370
I work for Google I work in support for

00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:20,810
Google container engine with Google

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:26,810
kubernetes engine and kubernetes who

00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:31,490
knows what kubernetes is so whew okay

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:34,850
it's a thing to orchestrate containers

00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:38,630
on many many nodes up to thousands of

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:43,420
nodes it was started by Google open

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:46,580
sourced by Google in 2015 I believe

00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:49,490
first big contributor was redheads

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:54,310
it is 100% open-source it's written in

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:58,400
go and by now it has won the market of

00:21:54,310 --> 00:22:01,490
managing containers on large notes I

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,960
just was at the keuken in Copenhagen

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:08,150
with 4300 participants and every company

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,670
you can imagine has an offering about

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:16,960
kubernetes just some logos of companies

00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:20,060
that use or contribute to kubernetes and

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,020
even more logos and this slides are

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:26,900
outdated so there are even more and

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:30,560
kubernetes you have some masters that

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:34,040
controls couplet on every note the

00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,800
couplet can start containers

00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:42,110
can set up networking stuff and can set

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:45,170
up volumes and the basic concept of

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:49,130
computation the basic primitive is a

00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:51,680
port a port is one to many containers

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,870
running together in one environment so

00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,510
that you have the possibility to have

00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,390
side cars running beside your main

00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:02,150
containers that does additional stuff it

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,020
has proven useful in Google's internal

00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,210
Bourque

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,390
container management engine that you

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:11,320
want to have certain containers always

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:14,720
running together ensuring resources

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:17,900
another important primitive is volume so

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,780
kubernetes can manage your storage and

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:26,600
provision storage to be accessible to

00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:30,590
your containers you can combine many

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:33,110
pots that provide the same service to be

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:37,790
accessible under the same IP address and

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:40,790
so have failover enable exist and of

00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:43,490
course then you have controllers that

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:48,710
scale your services scale down your

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:55,040
services restart failed ports or drain

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:57,250
notes that you want to take away and my

00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,650
question now is what is the role of

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,860
debian in a world where kubernetes

00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:06,590
becomes more and more popular even if

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:11,630
not that many of you have heard about it

00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:15,770
I believe that kubernetes will become

00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:18,290
even more popular and even as Debian

00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:21,410
maintainer I'm enthusiastic about how

00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:25,910
easy it becomes now to run your stuff in

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:29,360
kubernetes but you only need a very

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:32,660
minimal host operating system to install

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:37,160
kubernetes on your servers afterwards

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:39,080
you need bare image a base image for

00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,810
your container which is normally also a

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,570
very minimal image and you don't do

00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:48,020
apt-get install apache2 anymore to have

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:52,309
a webserver you take an Apache container

00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:57,200
and then you extend this image and put

00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:59,480
your app onto this image so you don't

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,220
need an Apache Debian image anymore in

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:10,340
such a word will we still need this in

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:13,040
Debian however nothing is perfect so on

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,380
cube con I also saw companies offering

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:20,750
oh we scan your container images for

00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:24,320
outdated libraries and you have long

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:26,630
times to update your cluster because all

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,450
the images all the containers needs to

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:33,410
be stopped you download new images you

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:36,370
start whole new environments so there

00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,750
are optimizations possible there and

00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,610
people are wondering ok where does my

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:44,750
stuff come from is it from a trusted

00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:47,480
source and my crazy thoughts maybe it's

00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:50,360
an opportunity here if Debian would

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:54,710
become a source of trusted binaries or

00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:59,490
even container images thank you

00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:03,100
[Applause]

00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:07,270
sorry am i in shop yeah next up on

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:08,620
Shelley talking about Manticore deep

00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:15,880
state and Deffer

00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:18,240
oh s you pretty much ready ready as

00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,240
we'll ever be

00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:37,670
meanwhile does anybody know any good

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:40,220
dance routines you know just a bridge

00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:44,130
over the time because I'm not going to I

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,130
[Music]

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,670
don't think I know any jokes

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,650
hopefully nearly there

00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,230
[Music]

00:26:53,650 --> 00:27:00,550
fling my phone from me

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,550
it's okay nobody calls me anyway so

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,620
don't see things

00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:32,660
I'm afraid I haven't gotten any more

00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:34,310
announcements hmm we're pleased to

00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:43,430
announce that there are nope no current

00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:46,030
announcements available the news has

00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,030
been called off

00:27:49,620 --> 00:28:04,270
do you actually have slime wondering if

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:07,270
we should swap you round but yes okay

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:09,730
right we have the interval act an

00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:12,190
interpretive dance by Andrea Dora on the

00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:19,090
nature of get see record being for the

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:21,480
win well you know anything to bridge the

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,480
time right

00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,079
[Music]

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:57,030
okay if in doubt make the font bigger

00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:02,160
hmm maybe I should give a lightning talk

00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:05,070
about that I think I might just at the

00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:50,040
very end I'll just disguise it as

00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:53,850
announcements can you hear me okay so

00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,770
I'm just going to show you small tiny

00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:58,100
agility I wrote actually I didn't write

00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:02,490
it from scratch I just ported it from

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:06,030
anyway so let's see we've got a gif of

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:08,250
like I've been doing like things with

00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,930
the Devon package lots of changes and I

00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:13,200
forgot to commit them individually so

00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:15,870
and now I like there's lots of patches

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,810
and things and I just want to somehow I

00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:22,230
saw this out so I just run again see

00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:25,250
record and suddenly I see I can see all

00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:29,000
of the things here I can unwrap the

00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:34,080
diffs what's happening with the lights

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,360
and I can I can basically I can select

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,420
bits individual bits of the of the diff

00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:45,540
and um let's just deselect all things

00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:48,500
commit those just a few they were like a

00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:55,520
few patches refreshed so I'm going to

00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:55,520
commit them now yes like refresh patches

00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:04,190
let's say you just refresh just enough

00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,190
Oh hmm

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,540
it's not going to work right because I

00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,360
haven't got a card and I forgot to

00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:14,130
disable the I don't think I can

00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,980
I don't remember I I probably can't

00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:18,210
really can't disable PTP sigh and

00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,440
unfortunately it's not implemented yet

00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:22,880
anyway

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:29,210
yeah this is using this thing you can

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:31,890
it's better than has it properly called

00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:33,950
like it's better than the built-in gift

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:47,630
get so I can't even remember its name

00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:49,860
huh yeah like that one yeah babe I I

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:53,720
didn't actually hear exactly what he

00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,720
said but like get patched something

00:31:53,929 --> 00:32:00,750
guitar - pants - and there's another one

00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,280
which is but there's one which is a bit

00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,800
more interactive and one which is a bit

00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,960
less interactive this is Meg interactive

00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,490
and there will be more features it is

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,100
actually it was originally written for

00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:13,470
mercurial and this was the thing which I

00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:17,150
really missed when I had to use git and

00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:20,010
now I don't have to anymore this is it

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:23,520
it's in Debian that's so you can up to

00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:25,080
install this if we prefer I may not okay

00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,300
it's it's in Devon and you can opt

00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,530
install it if you prefer or you can

00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,190
install it from source and there will be

00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:35,230
more features later at some point that's

00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,280
it thank you

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:40,770
[Applause]

00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,000
now now PR partially talking about all

00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:54,530
the things that I said he was going to

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:54,530
talk about earlier one moment please

00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,640
what was that

00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,170
[Music]

00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:36,480
nearly there almost

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:53,190
I think I might just give a talk at the

00:33:45,930 --> 00:34:00,470
end about advice to speakers yeah you

00:33:53,190 --> 00:34:00,470
know I'll even wear a suit

00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:23,450
right now

00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,450
the clock is ticking

00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:38,139
sorry about that I didn't really plan

00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:40,450
for this so I made these slides five

00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,489
minutes ago all right so I'm PR Portia

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:45,609
thank you for having me even if I'm

00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:47,829
actually unofficial netbsd developer but

00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:50,259
I've been using Debian since 99 so maybe

00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:52,690
I'm allowed and I'm also a security

00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:54,749
consultant interesting inconel

00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,739
development security integration and so

00:34:54,749 --> 00:34:58,059
what you could see on the slide right

00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:00,789
now is that almost on the board of

00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:01,989
directors of net bsd so actually I'm in

00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:05,680
a good position to talk about the

00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:07,239
project if if you would like to I would

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,329
like to talk to you about multi-core

00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:12,759
today it's a symbolic execution tool so

00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:14,979
basically it uses a CPU emulator which

00:35:12,759 --> 00:35:18,219
can be Hardware assisted of course to

00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:20,410
run analyze programs or algorithms so

00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:22,599
parts of programs on a simulated system

00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:25,509
and one of the eggs actually to make

00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:28,239
them crash so to make extensive fuzzing

00:35:25,509 --> 00:35:31,920
and be very efficient at fading by

00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:34,349
possibly tracing instructions and so on

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,599
whatever is going on inside the program

00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:40,150
it supports static Linux binaries in

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,839
sorry two bits and 64-bit mode also it

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:46,029
supports arms the to do two bit story

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:49,450
support is ongoing for arm 64 bits it

00:35:46,029 --> 00:35:51,670
also works with cerium bytecode there

00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:53,710
are official releases on github it's

00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,779
already packaged in package shows by

00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,789
myself and I'm actually looking for

00:35:55,779 --> 00:36:01,630
volunteers to package it for Debian or

00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:03,460
possibly help me to do so I'm actually

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:06,670
sponsored by cherub it's the developer

00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:11,619
of multi core to work on this which is

00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:13,499
also why I'm here the companion to multi

00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:16,329
core is called deep state it's

00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:17,289
specifically meant for unit testing with

00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:19,660
symbolic execution

00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:23,460
it supports not just multi-core but also

00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,900
another back-end for analyzing analyzing

00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,839
binaries running binaries it so it's

00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,849
called anger this auto back-end which

00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:33,749
was developed as a sidenote for the

00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:36,339
cyber Grand Challenge of DARPA last year

00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:37,809
so deep state is currently packaged in

00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:40,329
two separate packages in package shows

00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:42,489
by myself again unfortunately not yet

00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:43,670
fully upstream in package shows but

00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:45,770
basically I

00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,170
made one package with some strawberries

00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,849
and then the Python bindings this is

00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,440
also on github but with no official

00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:54,049
release yet because this is a very young

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,640
project too so I'm also looking for

00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:59,059
volunteering to be on to help me package

00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,250
that and then a shameless addition I'm

00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:05,240
also developer of or the main developer

00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:07,819
of d-4s open source this top environment

00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,930
and with some more parts in any project

00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:13,520
I have about 50 repositories now in this

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,710
and I'm therefore also looking for

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,510
volunteers to package search into Debian

00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:21,530
there are still projects you haven't

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:23,990
package yet as as far as I know so since

00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,750
I'm here I figured I could as well get

00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:28,369
my PGP key signed I suppose that's one

00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,960
of the steps to become a developer and

00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:35,180
if there are more I heard there are

00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,890
plenty then then please help me out with

00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:46,099
this I would welcome any and histones

00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:48,710
doing that alright thank you very much

00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:50,599
I guess that's it the next lightning

00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,450
talk session that I'm aware of is at

00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:56,089
DEFCON 18 in Taiwan hope to see as many

00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,900
of you as possible there right off you

00:37:56,089 --> 00:38:04,699
go lunch time

00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:04,699
