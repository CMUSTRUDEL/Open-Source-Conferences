it's time to say goodbye from this venue

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:17,920
it's almost over

00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:21,999

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,119

didn't see this image yesterday in the

00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:38,200
opening we've been here thanks to the

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,230
support of holding some sponsors DGI was

00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,970
the first gold sponsor which real made

00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,760
sure that we could really have the event

00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,980
in a nice setting and not asked there

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,470

00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,870
SIB kate them was also very generous

00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:57,100
they agreed to sponsor even when we

00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:59,710
already had the t-shirts printed we had

00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:03,850
no island google and credit he also has

00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:07,020
sponsors so in the end we could rent the

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,190
venue and even buy you all food and

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,100

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,759
we had 90 people registered and there's

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,800
not much more statistic available

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,380
besides the video team statistic was

00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,840
from the network there's no statistic

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,600

I think the food was quite good the

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,090
network I think was quite good

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:57,640
the venue itself besides it's an

00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:04,300
interesting place and maybe even the

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:06,370
weather and this room we didn't even

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,470
need the whole room like it looked small

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:12,220
at the beginning but we are this room

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:24,430
was enough for 90 people yeah please

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:26,680
tell me what else you liked I think

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,380
there's some things which were not so

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,100
good and we didn't have any talk by any

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:41,400
women the construction works were quite

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:44,200
annoying the paintwork was more keys

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:51,550
mm-maybe science and a map in the wiki

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:54,730
and another big a club smokers a club or

00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:59,560
child or child care there's more smoke

00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:03,790
custom children didn't want to make that

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,280
a print that would have been useful more

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,580
people for front desk was not that he

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:14,270
was also very helpful

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:18,570
[Applause]

00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:23,910
for there was like I was thinking that

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:27,480
yeah and better prevent communication if

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:29,550
we do that again which but tell me the

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,110
bad things or tell other people the bad

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,050
things to tell me if you don't want to

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,240
tell me an unlicensed SOI don't trust

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,930
your friends

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,560
yeah and in the future Minitab conf in

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,140
Hamburg next year again thinks that was

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,110
kind of an accident or today there's

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,390
longer talks then yesterday and some

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,419
people didn't know that tomorrow is free

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:57,980
day for most people and we could have

00:04:54,419 --> 00:05:01,980
also do it a week earlier when there's

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:06,810
what is this name of the song I thought

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:09,090
out of whatever Hancock yes also more

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,310
than part and in many countries but I

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,530
think I do like it at the Monday

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,720
tomorrow is free so it's very relaxed

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,300
Sunday and the last day is relaxed and I

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,490
think that's a nice feature and not

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:26,130
everybody comes to deaf camp but anyway

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:30,030
this because there could also be in some

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:32,880
other city and hemlock a year later so I

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,530
think rather Hamburg next year because

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,440
then it's easier with the venue and just

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:40,990
with everybody and the construction work

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,480
will go on for five or ten years anyway

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,090
or maybe in your city I would like to

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,790
see more depth minitab comes in Europe

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,400
in general and I think also their space

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:59,960
for too many depth comes in Europe for

00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:03,320
you whatever today we need to clean up

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,840
this floor and I would I think we should

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,660
just clean up everything here and get

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,700

00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,590

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,660
