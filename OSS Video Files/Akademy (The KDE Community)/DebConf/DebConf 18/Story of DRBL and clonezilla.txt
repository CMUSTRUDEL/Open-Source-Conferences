The DRBL and Clonezilla projects were born in Taiwan, and were heavily developed at NCHC. They were needed in the computer classroom and cluster computing in the beginning. Later as Debian live-package debuted in 2006, the DRBL/Clonezilla team created "Clonezilla live" with live-package and this Debian derivative release became popular. If you are interested in how the projects were born, and the evolution about them, please come to this talk.
