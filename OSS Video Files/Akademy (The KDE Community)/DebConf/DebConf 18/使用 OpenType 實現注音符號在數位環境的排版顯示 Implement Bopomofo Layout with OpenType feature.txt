這是一場國際化主題的演講，主要說明如何讓注音符號排版在Web以及資訊系統上呈現。在這五年的時間中，注音符號從W3C規範上的一項註釋開始，完成了HTML5的標註方法、確立了CSS標準並且受到瀏覽器實作。最終遇到了調號位置的問題，最近終於透過OpenType字體的功能而完成了最後一步。本演講主要說明這段時間的進程與標準化進度，以及所遇到的問題與經驗分享。

 This speech is about i18n. Bopomofo (Zhuyin Fuhao) is a phonetic system for Mandarin only used in Taiwan. It's layout is complex for web and information systems. In past five years, I participated W3C standardization activities to bring this issue from an annotation on W3C spec to finalize HTML ruby markup and push CSS spec to be implied by browsers. Tone mark position is the last step and we tried OpenType font feature as solution. I'll describe the process for standardization and problems and experience.

about it both hormone for palpable flow

00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:29,560

Chinese it is a very local issues for

00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:40,030
for Chinese hormone for years a phonetic

00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:43,149
system for education to tell to teaching

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:48,219
child how to spoiling the Chinese

00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:53,379
characters the Han characters in China

00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:56,350
and and the Hangul used being the pinyin

00:00:53,379 --> 00:01:02,920
system to spell in Chinese as this one

00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:13,659
the Hank active being coded LOI a Leo

00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:15,670
and in bamako system at Leo yes it's

00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:19,750
totally different the system was pinging

00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:26,320
and only used using hi one in the printt

00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:29,020
age in the print age the Ministry of

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,840
Education publishers trick to layout

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:35,470
looool about the character proportions

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,530
and in life abortion for education

00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,619
materials imprinting error and if we

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:45,250
want to see the reference checked into

00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:50,259
the QR code or as a bit of Italy to edge

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:53,530
TV SS capital e as an angle English

00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:56,860
translating the good of late for the for

00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:00,189
the material but when we go to the

00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:03,570
digital error how to represented the

00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:11,290
layout on the information systems and

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:13,930
everything that is that they try to make

00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,700
the Bob home of always the hang

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:23,220
characters as a grief in the font

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:26,150
but layers assuming and problem one hand

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,700
character have different meanings and

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:33,959
also have a different pronunciations as

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,770
this one we can within it can pronounce

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:41,250
as Liao

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:45,690
our low the Maxima pronunciation of the

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:50,580
Han characters have ever six so they

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:53,700
have to make six six set of the font as

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,040
a bundle when you want to show the

00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:01,530
different above home although you have

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:08,850
to switch the font to write one but the

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:12,480
trouble is led one the font itself do

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:16,440
not count end bopomofo informations so

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,930
at leg of the accessibility and in the

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,640
education situation sometimes will want

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:26,910
to type the wrong the wrong spelling

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,090
characters as a taste in the elementary

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:34,500
school the teachers will will use the

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:37,650
bottom oval found as a as a taste taste

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,519
the print and they have a face to the

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:44,970
wrong the wrong spelling what they copy

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:49,650
loved but it cannot represent and weep

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:54,180
or the beetle populations so i start

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,340
started to study this how can we make it

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,829
make the bubble for layout and wave

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,750
around the information system and the

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:02,940
way but carry the most of the content

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,010
and the digital public publications do

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,280
they are just like at the epub use the

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:12,660
same technology but when i guess that

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:16,079
it's that that is issue in 2013 I just

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,720
found in w3c specifications only one

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,770
progress to describe with bubble mofo

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:27,390
it's under the Japanese newbie usage we

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,810
use it Looby as some in Japanese lay

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:36,760
also they also

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:40,250
you use letter to you just letter to

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:47,030
mark up how to spell the hand characters

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:49,880
in Japanese kana because the the size is

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:53,180
small just like a gene Latin Looby so

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,730
they could let the new bit hexed as a

00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:02,650
notation for pronunciations but the

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:06,680
basic application is publishes in 1999

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:09,800
maybe in that time for somebody from

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:14,810
Taiwan or from Japan they participated

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:18,200
the WCC activities to provide the the

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:22,310
needs and the lake located under

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:26,440
specifications and after the 14 years

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:32,570
layers nothing nothing in the progress

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:34,880
so it's a just put it either way and we

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,870
still cannot do anything the

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,880
representative of all weight and

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:44,050
information system okay

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,640
five years ago I attended the the

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,190
laboratories workshop for these

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,270
populations and internet internet

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:57,169
generalizations we found some some

00:05:53,270 --> 00:06:00,110
issues need to be resolved one moment

00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:04,570
the blooby blooby Maccabi itself it's

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:07,789
not as a as a formal recommendations

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,590
specifications so nobody knows how to

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:13,760
make a book on mobile in the lobby

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:19,460
mock-up and a second there is no light

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:24,260
layout rules in CSS to format to do for

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:27,380
my the Papa mobile layout in life as as

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:31,220
the rule published by the Ministry of

00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:35,960
the education and the third problem is

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:40,520
the most important in the unicode 1.0

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:44,509
they just put everything every meanings

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:48,919
single caught a point in a home of all

00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:52,220
we have we have a five kind of the Tom

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:54,620
Rock a lighted home and the first at

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:58,009
home do not do that done - nanny the

00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,979
term rock and the second tone the second

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:05,120
tone third home and the first home but

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:08,479
you can see at X 2 the the accent and

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,229
modify the character for LA tène its

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,470
agree it is tempo grief do not match the

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:19,669
usage in the ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba for

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:25,580
Tomac so as the last problem we should

00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:29,020
issue to be resolved but fortunately

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:33,919
when I started to participate the CC C

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:36,530
activities it's on the html5 rush that

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,770
in 2013

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:43,430
never CC want to finalize that that the

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:45,830
html5 standards as the recommendations

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:50,060
and the layers a lot of things need to

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:53,479
be done just like a newbie so I made a

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:57,289
friend called Rubin Bert Jones in lat

00:07:53,479 --> 00:08:00,770
time he published it the CC HTML will be

00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:03,650
mock-ups extensions we can find a formal

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:08,560
way to mock up the bottom oval in

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:12,080
looking back up you just just use the

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,919
Ruby to walk up upper the the Han

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,469
character and the Looby loo the the the

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,360
Boca mobile for home for characters and

00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:23,060
if these allow you to home put it a live

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,699
home before the Bougainville character

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,909
and it's the second service falls don't

00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:31,460
Jessup we after the bubble of a

00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:38,510
character so we can confirm how to

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:41,839
makeup removal and in lot of time the

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:45,620
Japan they want to push the CSS and

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,990
html5 to be implemented by the browsers

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,450
and the way Bible a our engines because

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,840
they want to

00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:57,710
epub three a slayer ebook standards and

00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:01,820
I want to the industry get the technical

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:06,590
issues down and the lateness awaken they

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:10,760
can they can publish more ebooks in the

00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:14,000
USA and nurse so some some people the

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:18,530
Erica we also called he called her

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,710
fantasy and a is she coach who righted

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:26,150
the both of them right the writing mode

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:28,340
for the vertical writings in CSS they

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:32,120
also read the CSS loopy like how much

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:37,670
labor what to confirm where how to put

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:40,700
the dope home oval layout in the right

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:44,930
side in in the in the in the right right

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:48,020
side of a can characters so after that

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:52,460
the apples the very first the implied

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:56,270
that the CSS word values so we almost at

00:09:52,460 --> 00:10:02,300
done current boho over on browsers you

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:04,400
can see it's it's a it's almost okay but

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:08,390
if we say the closer you can find a lot

00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:13,160
it at home rock is not a put aside the

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:15,920
of the Obama for characters and how can

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,710
we arrange that home marks the position

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,760
to the right place and the fix the grief

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:31,430
you know the share wisdom share was sure

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:35,450
was the LA tène so first in the in a

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:38,990
meeting of the Senate working group the

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:42,740
some implement was the last guys told me

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:45,860
it's hard to imply the employee the

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,710
Tomica adjustment with the layout Angie

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:55,660
like why do you not try the phone

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:59,810
features but the open type features I

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,240
don't know anything about that yet the

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,390
open type

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,910
this is made by Adobe and the Microsoft

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:12,670
and only a few of the document you can

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:16,480
you can find on the internet so I don't

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:19,120
know how to get at it and even we can

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,060
fight expert the one to make some say

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,580
take a try we don't know the browsers

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:30,550
suppose those never use the feature or

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:33,339
not so we just in in the in the loop

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:36,580
don't know how to get at it

00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:40,390
finally I find a found engineers in

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:45,690
Taiwan willing to help me to take make a

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:50,860
simple font for try so we make a form of

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:54,430
a simple font portrayal but it doesn't

00:11:50,860 --> 00:12:00,070
works all over the browsers including

00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:02,589
Firefox Google Chrome Safari and an for

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:07,079
sure of course the Internet Explorer in

00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:10,180
age does support that but the Mozilla

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:13,630
from time one but now in the Bay Area at

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:16,870
the Kevin Shea he told me later he can

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:21,070
try to report back to the of urban hype

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:24,339
engine called half buzz not let Firefox

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:29,050
use used folder for the urban hype

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:32,829
features and as I accepted and affixed

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:36,760
just after half of the II years every

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:41,110
everything works so the problem that

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:44,220
open the test advanced can use the under

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:49,180
Firefox Google Chrome and Libre Office

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:54,750
so we have faced another problem it's

00:12:49,180 --> 00:13:00,120
the taste of file semantically good for

00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:00,120
Standardization or not so we're back to

00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:07,260
Mac to self-assess ape

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:08,819
how can we find all the open type expert

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:13,739
to

00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:18,470
you our our our sample fund or you find

00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:24,149
dr. calendar in Adobe here's some my own

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:27,479
a few of the OpenType expert he gave us

00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:30,029
give us some advice to publish in a

00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:34,529
second disassembled font and the way

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:40,439
tried on open firefox and chrome were

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:43,199
founded it's nearly done in horizontal

00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:46,139
writings you can put with the boho

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:50,749
mobile above the hand characters and

00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:53,999
they use the open type features Looby to

00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:59,249
replace the grief that they either feel

00:13:53,999 --> 00:14:02,189
the Ministry of Education rule for

00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:06,479
bopomofo and in vertical writing it can

00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:10,229
just put the homework aside the Bokova

00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:13,319
characters and it's very well and it's

00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:17,549
also the public dialect oom-pah-pah more

00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:22,769
for Amina and Hakka that the Chinese

00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:26,759
dialect they have their own layer layer

00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:30,929
own character characters for spelling we

00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:34,069
published them taste the case on github

00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:39,239
if you interesting with leather you can

00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:42,659
see the check it on our github but we're

00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:47,779
facing the last Thursday but what's next

00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:51,029
which we should do because it's a mixed

00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:53,789
with the de bercy's the way bystanders

00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:57,479
and the founder features we do not know

00:14:53,789 --> 00:15:01,979
how to publish the best practice as the

00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:04,289
standards should we try to talk to

00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:06,569
doubles we see the internet sensation

00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:11,369
working group published letter as a note

00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:14,189
or salute Adobe text technical technical

00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:17,339
know the tool negative its private area

00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:18,520
but but they you know the Adobe

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:22,830
publishing a lot

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:28,899
a lot of they have a lot of software to

00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:36,820
do the layout and the text so they have

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:41,500
a inference for the foe yeah for aerial

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:44,589
usage and how to spray the best practice

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:48,190
in Taiwan through the Ministry of

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:50,080
Education hi Juan lame care about the

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,270
little battle they do not care how to

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,510
use that on the information system and

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:59,020
wave and somebody told me the Bureau of

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:02,529
Standards they may interesting to

00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:05,350
publish a side note of the CNS one one

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:08,140
six four three as a Chinese Chinese

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:12,730
standard interchange code as integer

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:15,430
code for for Chinese it's related to to

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:24,580
the Unicode but only the Han character

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:28,600
using I want but or maybe someone want

00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:32,830
to try to make some service or make a

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,890
side use the technology you use the the

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:40,959
font and the mock up the publish is for

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:44,380
the Papaji materials for education and

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,190
another problem is in the open source in

00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:52,240
the open source worded that I'm a

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:54,490
Firefox Google Chrome and and liberal

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,130
fees they share the same of open type

00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:00,550
over time angel half bus so everything

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:03,610
is done but the era post WebKit at

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:07,059
Microsoft stage I still have a lot of

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:09,900
back to fix and the layer private area

00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:13,660
we cannot do anything just a report bug

00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,480
fortunately when I participated CC

00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:20,140
activities I've met her some expert in

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,900
Apple in the WebKit team they know a lot

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,050
of sense of about open type and accepted

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,630
the bug and let me name a fixed him but

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,429
the Microsoft I

00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:34,160
I don't know if I'll debugger that one

00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:38,720
years ago and even nobody to watch that

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,490
okay I want to share some my experience

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,880
about the Challenger and the problem

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:49,860
when I in the in the standardless

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:53,970
activities one are you qualified

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:57,360
when I first first time I attended WCS

00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:01,110
the workshop everything's very

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:05,070
approached one appreciate that Wow

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:08,460
because there is nobody know the Chinese

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:10,470
the Chinese text and layout when they

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,809
say I said one group won't do something

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,600
with waste the CJ casings they have a

00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:19,590
lot of a bunch of the Japanese expert

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,309
but nobody know Chinese so but we are

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:26,970
back to Taiwan when I talk to government

00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:29,970
talk to the in the education area

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,820
actually just ask are you linguist do

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:37,080
you have the experience to teach a man

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:40,559
the Rings or do you have some degrees in

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:45,990
the information information science

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:51,360
computer camera engineering Oh of the

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:54,020
nzs know and somebody even ask let can

00:18:51,360 --> 00:19:02,159
you speak English as the native speaker

00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:07,100
no okay yeah that time so finally I find

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:12,539
that I didn't he because when CC see him

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:16,169
that won't accept my proposal to to let

00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:20,190
me as an invited expert so I have an

00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:23,309
identity to do the things I am I'm

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:27,000
thinking about that when I back to

00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:30,900
Taiwan the government and was already

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:37,410
constantly asked asked me for my

00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:41,100
qualifications I once my friend

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:46,680
nor instantly he have a podcast called

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:51,570
ID Conlon in China he know what I I have

00:19:46,680 --> 00:20:00,330
I have done so he invited me to to

00:19:51,570 --> 00:20:03,390
record one topeka about doing the

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:08,430
digital publishing standardization in

00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:12,840
the activism as a activism way so I just

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:16,880
find oh it's spherical is great a title

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:20,810
to explain what I am what I am doing

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:29,130
because the purple Moonville they have

00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:32,640
in Taiwan somebody have have provided

00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:35,970
the requirement for now it's almost

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,030
twenty years ago but they said just put

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,430
put in layer for 15 years and it nobody

00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:46,260
do anything for that I think it's a

00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:48,570
issue to the people are soft so it if it

00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:53,760
layers nobody qualified to do to do that

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:57,780
I can just take a try what I want to say

00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:02,580
is that I feel very confident the bow in

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:07,320
the open-source activities and pepper

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:10,410
CDC's services meetings but the point

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,960
where back to the to the real world

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,420
where back to Taiwan I think encourage

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,200
nobody supported me to do things it's to

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:22,160
do thing

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:26,340
and the second one is where the rivers

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:29,960
the only thing publishes a publish data

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:32,700
about it the bopomofo is the booklet

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,950
called the boy dream for Hartford's her

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:38,250
in english it that the phonetic symbol

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:41,810
of Mandarin Chinese published by the

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:47,050
Ministry of Education in year 2000 and

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:50,790
last year they asked me to

00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:56,440
translate that into English version and

00:21:50,790 --> 00:22:02,640
publishes the e-book so yes that's the

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,640
only preference for me to do the things

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:12,630
sometimes in Japan in Japan they they

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:17,290
want to keep that they want to keep

00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:20,080
their Japan is layout rules so in 20

00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:24,370
years ago they publish their own Japan

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:28,120
is the industry standard for write down

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:31,890
every rules about the Japanese layout

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:35,760
and it's greater reference for that

00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:38,680
photo so you see to render the the

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,130
requirement for Japanese taste and

00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:46,260
layout and they write in the gap

00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:50,530
document and the what cannot be done

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:53,850
cannot be represent on web so and the

00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:56,770
CSS working group trying to do as much

00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:01,330
about in Chinese we do not have things

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:04,240
left leg left so when we made made every

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:07,540
Chinese issues we have a asking expert

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,780
here in the lair so I have have did

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:13,630
another thing is to read a lot of the

00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:17,050
rule books for publishing in Taiwan and

00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:19,480
China's and rather than requirement for

00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:22,110
the Chinese texting and the layouts if

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:28,120
there is no reference you can try to

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:31,270
write one by yourself and like everyone

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:37,050
to review and give a comment to fix that

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:41,200
and the third sort of home is the

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:44,770
particle issues in time one recently

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,710
somebody somebody says we should abandon

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:53,080
the book mobile system and try to use

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:54,490
the pinging system to instead but it's

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,820
not happened

00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:05,290
and it's somebody's political preference

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:10,120
but in Taiwan the in Thailand government

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:13,600
layer they're overwhelmed by by the

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,929
people's voice so if a some congressman

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,500
or somebody they publishes they

00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:25,059
published the those others opinion on

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:30,250
life they will hold for the holder for

00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:34,830
the funding for the bopomofo project as

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:41,500
exactly what I am doing so it's quite

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:43,770
frustrated and relative to the each of

00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,770
four

00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,300
[Music]

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:16,809
can you repeat are you saying that

00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:19,389
attempting to use opinion yeah okay the

00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:24,129
problem of a system it's already for 100

00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:29,350
years in originally in China then with

00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:31,509
the KMT to Taiwan and use the in Taiwan

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,749
to teach in the how to spell in hand

00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:37,119
characters and the recently you know

00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:39,399
some ways to code the Tama independent

00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:43,330
and they want to do that they want to

00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:46,119
abandon the old system bring by the KMT

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,100
to Taiwan they want to use the ping

00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:51,639
system to restate the two instead

00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:55,389
because if the pinyin system ISM better

00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:59,860
the locomobile system for the Taiwanese

00:25:55,389 --> 00:26:02,470
and the in Taiwan is working is wrong

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:06,999
because the mean none they are left mean

00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:10,059
an agrarian Hakka so they just saw some

00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:12,309
congressmen and people they spoke to

00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:15,100
that highway independently a John stated

00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:20,019
abandon the bopomofo sister and use the

00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:22,690
pain to his death there are dialects in

00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:27,999
Taiwan that are better served by Bamako

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:32,999
ah the means change we came back to the

00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:36,249
sign error positive negative which who I

00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:37,990
understand what bopomofo is a little bit

00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:42,850
about the politics what I don't

00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:45,879
understand is if you put pinyin Ruby in

00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:53,259
instead of pokomoko ruby would someone

00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:55,929
be unhappy hmm I do not they explained

00:26:53,259 --> 00:27:00,220
that it's quite a small you can't read

00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:03,129
check it out because talking years ago

00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:07,299
the Ministry of Education they published

00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:10,179
a sign system the Papa mo fo for the

00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:11,360
dialect they have a different different

00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:16,010
balls

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:21,410
and and at home Max and what deal - what

00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:25,070
deal - that was mr. in the in the simple

00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:29,870
font and the people used a homo Volvo

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:34,429
dialect and pinging poly only for two

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:37,250
different yeah different language same

00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:40,870
language you can spell that by bopomofo

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:45,620
for dialect and also by pinging yes I

00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:48,950
understand so if you put pinion instead

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,580
of Brooklyn mofo in the Ruby would that

00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,460
be a problem

00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,760
it seems that I wonder if you could

00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,169
increase the size of your user community

00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,850
if there would be mainland Chinese

00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:06,679
people who would like to have the

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:11,419
opinion Ruby next add some my friend my

00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:14,120
friend called Ariel Erica leave you he

00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:17,270
have a have a fighter coast highway is

00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:21,730
beautiful as in Chinese about the

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:25,880
typography and the font his published

00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:28,370
article code the war I peeing I love

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:32,840
peeing last year

00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:37,220
he sell at them in China there is no

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:41,090
lower books for peeing layout and a lot

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:45,650
of problems for pinging you can you can

00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:50,929
say that in a simplified Chinese

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:56,350
character defunct as lot empath always

00:28:50,929 --> 00:29:02,140
do not doing well for combine the

00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:07,220
alphabet the characters with the West

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:10,760
Was that homework so you can see and he

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,679
wanted to deal that was fond but the

00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,200
China government alike do not have the

00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,970
Lua books and the layer national

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:23,030
standards for the Oasis things like this

00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,900
so if we if if we in time one would

00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,050
abandon the

00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:29,960
system and use the pinging we still have

00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:32,360
the lot of problem with the only the

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,690
reference publishes by by Tommen

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:40,940
government or anywhere as a reference

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:44,990
and to and to do the best best practice

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:48,140
in font we still do with the need to do

00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:51,380
things in that but for now I think the

00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:55,520
poem over steel in every elementary

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:58,460
school and the kids Gardens the children

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,730
they still learn how to spell hand

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:04,850
character with bopomofo so so I think a

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:07,580
Pokemon for steel should be for bobbin

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:11,510
for layout still should be done for web

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:17,510
and information system labor office the

00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:19,100
border process everything so but for me

00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:23,560
as a disaster

00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:28,480
because it really the next issue

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,480
insufficient found I do not have them

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:35,090
the meaning is the energy the hobby

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:39,920
issues can it's good and they are good

00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:46,240
and you can rise the problem and this

00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:50,120
curse ways expert but in my experience a

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:53,480
lot of a lot of a lot of issues you

00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:56,120
arise layer it will just cannot be

00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:00,860
resolved if you do not matter the keeper

00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:03,560
set and then know who did that the

00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:07,370
face-to-face meeting is there important

00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:11,510
to make connections that you know who in

00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:16,270
we're doing what and he can help you to

00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:19,640
leg things make it real and go faster so

00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:22,460
in the bursaries that were Cecily have

00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:26,890
yearly the technical in the primary

00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:30,410
advisors come compressed call it he pack

00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:32,660
every year just to have a routine one

00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:36,590
years because the bursary you see they

00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:37,570
have of four horses University one yeast

00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,570
and

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:43,270
in Europe and another is MIT and the

00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,300
keio university in japan and recently

00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:49,180
they have a bay hung Beijing so in a

00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:51,670
just a yearly one year in Europe and

00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:56,260
another years maybe in the United States

00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:59,470
and another years in Japanese four years

00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:03,490
ago they have lair conference in China

00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:06,540
but recently they do not want to hell

00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:09,370
the the cameras in China because and

00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,910
conference to talk about it the way

00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:18,130
verse tender but till they have a bend

00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:20,140
every website being and the in the

00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:22,720
conference hope it's doesn't make sense

00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,990
so they do not want to how did the

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,530
cameras be in China but the the problem

00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:32,440
is that in Taiwan you know I have yearly

00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:36,370
travel to total United States and Europe

00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:40,570
as a that's a lot of money so I do not

00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:43,360
have them from now I haven't I have one

00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:45,820
to serve the Chinese issues with the

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:51,730
west up with deborah's we see for five

00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:56,140
years I paid by myself to the things

00:32:51,730 --> 00:33:01,480
that I have tried to find a founder

00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:04,150
filete if I find the government I will

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,600
fight it were back to the the issue one

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:11,520
and three one the government were asking

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:19,120
me IRA qualify to the lat

00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:21,280
no okay and three the politic issues you

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,950
want to solve the poem over layout and

00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,740
maybe we soon will abandon the Bellomo

00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:32,020
system so I am Not sure we can fund you

00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:35,550
or not so forget that forget what

00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,760
happened okay I haven't want to try the

00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,910
crowdfunding's

00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,910
and

00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:45,570
three years ago I have a write an

00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:48,570
article for a scuffle for sponsors for

00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:53,070
my traveling expense

00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:58,950
finally I get a I got 100,000 Taiwan

00:33:53,070 --> 00:34:00,720
dollars it equals two three three three

00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:08,580
thousand US dollars

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:11,640
it's only a few and not now it cannot go

00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:16,020
to the crowd because of justa 2020

00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:21,000
peoples and sri peoples they just

00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:24,540
funding me eighty percent

00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:30,510
Poletti so finally I found you you can

00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:33,690
if you want to do do things like this at

00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:37,170
the AK in activity activists the way to

00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:41,820
do the generalizations you have to find

00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:48,830
only who care about the issue find some

00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:55,680
partners they will help you both for you

00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:59,940
for your activity so bopomofo is really

00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:04,440
really a very local issues because the

00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:08,160
system only used in taiwan and why it

00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,820
have been bring in to the table so you

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,070
see the standard centers sending

00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:19,340
organisations but just to put a layer

00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:21,750
for 15 years there's a ladder of a

00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:26,570
Chinese layout and it takes the issue

00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:29,580
have to be resolved but not done yet

00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:33,500
fortunately in diversity is very

00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:36,570
peaceful then you knowing a lot of

00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:42,840
international organizations the China

00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:48,780
always have a comment for us but not

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:51,890
happening in CC C and do you know when

00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:54,600
the time one

00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:59,120
taijuan quitted the United Nations we

00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:03,180
have we cannot join the ISO and IEC

00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:05,900
meetings we do not have we are not we're

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:09,540
not nation bodies so we cannot

00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:17,060
participate every meeting hold by ISO

00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:24,000
and IEC only one meetings that gg gg to

00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:27,360
let let us have a committee lay in

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,450
charge of the unicode and a unicode the

00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:33,750
most of heart of the unicode codepoints

00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:37,770
our hand character so i can participate

00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:41,100
in the meeting and the recently when we

00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:44,880
deal with them deal with the bottom of

00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:50,070
all issues we just send a proposal to

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:54,330
the to the GG - and have accepted so at

00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:56,940
two years later we can fix the simple

00:36:54,330 --> 00:37:00,300
belief simple grief over the bubble

00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:07,110
mobile and histone mark in unicode so

00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:13,860
it's really really released it knows

00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:17,700
when it will be done so as a mine it's

00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:19,920
my experience is the process in the five

00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,890
years how to deal the pope home of a

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,880
layout the issues are web and others in

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:32,210
information systems and my experience to

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:35,640
participate participated as then the the

00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:42,620
personalization process in the activist

00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:49,400
way I think it may relate it to some

00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:49,400
people in the open source open software

00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:56,660
circles so the funding is still a

00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:01,539
problem I think so

00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:08,150
and the next the next second j-serve

00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:12,170
also Otto said that yes his open open

00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:14,510
software support is and he always talked

00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:18,770
about the localization

00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:22,940
issues ten years ago a lot of people's

00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:26,690
were working for for translating and

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:30,380
localizations for labor always and now

00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:35,510
and and a lot of the project but the

00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:41,359
recently recently only a few one or two

00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:44,930
people care about that we do not we do

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,150
not have a lot of people to do to

00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:53,480
contribute for the translations and an

00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:57,770
organization I after in my experience I

00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:01,869
think we should reward because if a

00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:06,980
society as a student style project or

00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:11,210
are your personal personal idea to do

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:14,589
things at will can take long either if

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:25,220
you do not have a sufficient sufficient

00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:27,380
economic of support so it's also my

00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:32,089
final report for the bopomofo and a

00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:37,910
chinese layer and maybe my activities

00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:40,730
for the standardization because it's

00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:47,119
quite higher to pay everything by

00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:51,710
yourself I will attend workshop a

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,990
workshop in Tokyo about it about the use

00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:59,059
of publications in magazines and among

00:39:53,990 --> 00:40:05,960
God it it will be the last workshop I

00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:09,829
attend by the way do you know CC C

00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,610
suppose me a lot not by man not by

00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:13,730
funding

00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:16,220
they invited me as the business agenda

00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:19,130
to recruit members in Taiwan

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:23,080
- Sierra goes in Taiwan we have a su

00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:25,640
remember the academic as Danica and two

00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:29,480
organizations founded by the government

00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:33,080
they join CC C for their own project

00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,930
because the in that time the HTF I'm is

00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:39,590
saying a rush people want to onto Mac

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:43,070
what want to make the web apps web app

00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:47,750
so they joined our CC but three years

00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:50,300
ago they old quit because the government

00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:55,970
had found them for further for the

00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:59,240
membership fee so the bursary she asked

00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:02,510
me we do not have any members in Taiwan

00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:06,830
but oh and with you you participate

00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:08,990
every every meeting we're quite a family

00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:11,210
year can do things like that we have a

00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:14,710
good Commission for if you will

00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:17,950
successful recruit a member in Taiwan I

00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:22,840
have worked for half of eight years I

00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:28,130
think'll as the strees and what make me

00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:28,910
want to live there they lived a circle

00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,610
Wow

00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:35,330
every organization said let open

00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:37,460
standards if they make a de oh and the

00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:41,330
standard has matured supported by the

00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:44,630
browsers and the way we'll consider to

00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:47,660
used in our information system but if

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:56,970
you want to let some sir participate at

00:41:47,660 --> 00:42:00,900
the activity I think it'll cost a lot so

00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:03,839
ah sorry about that I don't want to let

00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:07,260
my sessions as a compelling reason but

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:12,810
in the five years Oh every every my head

00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:21,450
it was my every speech

00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:23,810
I am always complex sorry but yattawan

00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,810
Timo

00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:51,110
although is in in a bit different feel

00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:54,510
but we are still facing the same problem

00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:58,170
now we are trying to promote the opened

00:42:54,510 --> 00:43:00,780
up informant in the government and yes

00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:03,630
they are starting to talk to that but

00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:08,370
when we talk about for example

00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:12,480
contribute back to the ODF or the F or

00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:20,190
the committee or the F new spec research

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:22,680
and speaking of money they were not they

00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:32,280
just the jetter us that is impossible

00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:35,280
for them to pay anything to your chosen

00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:41,100
the girl non-profit non-governmental

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:46,380
profit and III I tried I try to make

00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:50,610
them for example right now one thing we

00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:55,920
were successful that the government

00:43:50,610 --> 00:44:02,670
invest a team of local developers to to

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:06,810
improve the so we're but I've tried to

00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:09,050
per for example may make them supports

00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:14,750
to attend the conference or the tender

00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:19,010
OTF improve aspect improvement the I was

00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:29,700
rejected of surprise so I can understand

00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:34,350
how we can just say that you know we

00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:39,530
still need to work a lot to me and just

00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:42,600
dug in my previous session I say that we

00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:45,930
we have the trance that because we have

00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:49,410
a strange form of site down from the

00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,520
power but for all these I know I know

00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:55,350
you have working

00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:57,330
for that for a long time but current

00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:01,770
even harder because we have political

00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:05,850
issues so yeah I can understand yeah

00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:09,390
actually I'm a I'm expedited Oh dorita

00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:16,740
in the sessions in the morning should

00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:20,220
give some more good answers for the

00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:25,920
questions because she is some unique

00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:32,970
odor and contributed a lot for the what

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:37,890
languages not paisa per yeah pearl so

00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:41,670
and he she have a the open government is

00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:44,430
g0 be projector to deal the dictionary

00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:48,690
published by the banned by the Ministry

00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:52,200
of Education so I think when he goes to

00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:55,890
the good go get into the government and

00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:58,680
as a minister could help open-source

00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:02,930
project and the open standard activity

00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,930
but no

00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:16,490
opportunity a political opportunity to

00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:18,890
push this project forward the whole

00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:22,940
world wishes it could learn Chinese

00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:26,120
easier and the Han characters are a

00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:29,120
major barrier for anyone from a Latin

00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:33,380
script country

00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:36,770
I admire the Ruby script the way you

00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:40,880
have the tiny little characters next to

00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:43,760
the larger Han character and the idea

00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:49,490
that you can make that easily fit in

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:53,330
type typeset seems very useful and I

00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:58,460
know locally there is a big need for the

00:46:53,330 --> 00:47:00,830
bopomofo Azorian but in mainland in

00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:03,820
other countries there might be an

00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:07,700
interest in the same kind of techniques

00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:10,700
used with Roman letters so the mainland

00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:14,420
maybe they would like to have opinion

00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:17,630
letters a little Roman letters in that

00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:20,000
kind of Ruby position and I wonder if

00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:22,520
there is an overlap there where the

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,400
resources might be available because

00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:29,450
they also would like to see typeset that

00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:32,870
uses this Ruby position that's really a

00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:39,670
problem because you can if you see you

00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:41,180
for now the the the peeing it can be a

00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:45,140
terrible waste

00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:48,560
with Lucas perspicacious but you know in

00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:51,860
painting the one Hank octant maybe may

00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:56,570
be pronounced as of five hours or six

00:47:51,860 --> 00:48:01,670
loitering characters and it's just over

00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:05,680
flowed over the size and in China's well

00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:11,660
ladies I'd like I'd like to really add

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:14,570
the accent mark on the end pinging so

00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:17,990
you can spell it but you need to know

00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:19,190
that you do not know the tarnation I I

00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:24,470
have a friend

00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:27,230
in Germany he learned Chinese by

00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:30,829
popemobile system and he told me that it

00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:32,660
bubble of her system from the study is

00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:34,400
quite a difficult because you do not

00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:40,730
know the bubble more for character but

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:45,319
once you know how to probe now and it is

00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:48,740
only four and do not have a complex and

00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:52,670
in China China people do not add that at

00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:55,010
home mark so in in I think the bomb

00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:58,400
waffle is nice system but the only in

00:48:55,010 --> 00:49:01,970
China and outside Taiwan you know the

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:05,300
judge China though the peeing dominated

00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:08,390
the the hand collectors education so

00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:12,500
that's the problem and I have asked my

00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:14,300
friend he is also the editor of the

00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:20,030
requirement for the change in Chinese

00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:23,510
text and layout I asked him how to dream

00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:26,200
that why do you not try to deal with the

00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:29,810
pinging issues make people in China

00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,579
raised awareness to sterilization and

00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:36,369
the public that the government puppet

00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:41,020
the lower books it just told me that no

00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:44,329
because in China a view and the

00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:46,940
government office in the education

00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:51,260
education system you cannot do anything

00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:56,500
so I think I am a quite a tough in in

00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:59,030
the process their activities but

00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:05,210
fortunately and they're so good I can

00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:06,369
still I can still to things and get

00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:11,839
things done

00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:15,589
that's the great ok however want he any

00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:18,010
question our let's have a coffee break

00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:18,330
thank you everyone

00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:22,900
you

00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:22,900
