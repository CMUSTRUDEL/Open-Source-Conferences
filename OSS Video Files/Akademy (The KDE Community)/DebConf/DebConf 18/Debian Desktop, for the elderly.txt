I was born in year 1955.

So, I can explore the world of elderly people as an insider. This short talk is about a series of workshops which I organized in a French computer club which often gathers a small society of elderly people, most of whom are retired for a long time.

Debian may be a good system for the elderly, when someone can tune it finely for each particular user. We shall consider a catalog of situations implying individual users, and their feelings about such a disruptive environment (just imagine: having lived all one's life with W$, and discover freedom).

You know? old timers are not that different from you. Maybe some day you will feel like them?
