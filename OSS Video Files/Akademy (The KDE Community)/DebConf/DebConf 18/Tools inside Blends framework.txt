In Debian Pure Blends several tools were created to maintain packaging on one hand as well as publishing related content in the so called web sentinel.  This talk will give an overview about the tools, the collection of data (like scientific citations, software registries and other metadata) as well as team metrics to know how a Blends team works together.  It might help people to get a better understanding of Blends and get an idea how to create an own Blend.
