The support for typesetting Japanese (or any CJK language) in TeX in particular TeX Live, has been considerably improving over the last few years. From practical non-existence 10 years ago where every Japanese TeX user was used to download and compile packages (pteTeX, pTeXLive) to a simple `apt-get install texlive-lang-japanese` was a long way.

In this talk we recall a bit of the history of Japanese TeX in (Debian) TeX Live and give an introduction to the particularities of Japanese typographic rules and how they are implemented in TeX. We will shortly touch on how to typeset multilingual CJK documents in TeX using upTeX and LuaTeX, and report on the current state of CJK font support in TeX concerning free and commercial fonts.

okay thanks everyone for joining the

00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:14,440
session here it's I see a few Asian face

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,209
so I'm a bit nervous about talking about

00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,820
this topic typesetting this country

00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:22,720
because of course it's not my native way

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,419
of writing and reading yeah so what I

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,689
want to report about today is what's the

00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:31,230
currents well first of all about

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,670
specialities of typesetting this kanji I

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,680
excuse me of myself I mean no ambient

00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,390
Eva in Taiwan where they use traditional

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,990
Hansy

00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:43,030
I come from Japan I'm used to Japanese

00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,950
typesetting rules I will mostly talk

00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,550
about Japanese typesetting rule I will

00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:51,820
mention Chinese rules there's one reason

00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:56,290
for this that if you check like the w3c

00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,300
consortium rules the Japanese the rules

00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,550
for Japanese typesetting are the most

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,640
specific compared to the others so they

00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,199
are most strict and very detailed and

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
also one reason is because there's the

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,360
biggest mixture of writing systems

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,460
okay so typesetting with kanji I will

00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,770
talk about these peculiarities with

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:19,090
types in this country and then about

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:23,320
integration of as a page as in with into

00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:25,780
the Japanese well CJK typesetting into

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,120
taste life and how take life and then

00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,229
well that means also in debian because

00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,940
that life is as is in debian yeah just

00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:36,340
to introduce myself from my companies

00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,190
I'm working on completely different

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,369
things is a CDN Network in in CDN

00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:45,340
company for in Tokyo but I'm also take

00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:47,500
life maintainer of page life and since

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,270
many years now and since I moved to

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,700
Japan nine years ago my other member of

00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:55,299
the Japanese stage development community

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,689
trying to improve the experience for

00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:02,740
users of tea ctk languages okay what

00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:05,380
what what's the layout for today it's

00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,240
like first as I said I will discuss

00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,119
specialities of Japanese types I think

00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,220
especially I mean this X applies not

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,889
only for Japanese I will I excuse myself

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,250
as I said I will speak most about this

00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:20,740
but in the same way applies to other

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,290
systems especially with mixing different

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,990
lighting systems like Roman letters and

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,940
non Roman letters and grid typesetting

00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,040
something which is very important in

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,620
this system then I will go through the

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,630
history of the PDI family probably most

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,630
of you unless you are somehow a

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,600
typesetting aficionado from Japan you

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,130
will have never heard about this is an

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,400
pay engine that was developed already

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,890
more than 20 years ago by Japanese

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,050
company and then independently just to

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,410
support the specific requirements of

00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,480
Japanese DEP SEC thing and it recently

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,340
became integrated into take life and

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,230
then I will report just quickly about

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:04,450
the current Saito's what can actually be

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:06,280
done so ok that's the ideal if you if

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,239
you have an idea but what's this this is

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,910
one of the example of first moving

00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:16,020
letters moveable types long before

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:19,150
Gutenberg in China set perfect aligned

00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:22,660
nice I mean of course perfect the line

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,940
but this book this would be the ideal in

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,060
in setting country this is possible

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,250
because every different country has the

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,170
same dimension so they are all set on

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,720
the same dimension that means all the

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,030
line lengths are the same but lines here

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,290
are typically vertically this is

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,600
something yeah and so it would be an

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,430
very nice great reality looks much

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,030
different if you look at a typical

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,920
Japanese text you have a mixture of

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,920
three writing three to four writing

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,950
systems spacing is definitely not only

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,350
great there are lots of reasons why this

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:03,250
happens and we will discuss this year so

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:07,030
we here see running Latin text in the we

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:09,760
see spacing marks we have spaces up here

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,500
we have here we don't have hanging book

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,500
to punctuation but we will see examples

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,620
later so it's also what you see is that

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,850
Japanese is like traditional Chinese is

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:25,300
set in two directions so it's some other

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,640
like it comes later anyway so what are

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,430
the reasons for this annal that doesn't

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,610
really work I'm aliveness here the

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,470
reasons are

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,960
why these letters here if you look at

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,180
the same the first letter is true and

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,310
but other letters they are not like on a

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,780
nice grid as we have seen before so what

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,450
are the reasons for all this well there

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,580
are lots of them one is that well we

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,690
have different writing systems now it is

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,870
at least as we in Japanese four are used

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,180
permanently

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,670
they are punctuation system that haven't

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,130
been in the old times punctuation system

00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,890
changed layout completely then there are

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,100
special rules that we also have in Latin

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:08,430
type settings like widows and orphans

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:11,250
it's like just that in it applies not to

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,620
words but to a single characters well

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,540
and then different type of development

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,900
like hanging poo creation indentation so

00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,000
there are a lot of reasons so in Japan

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,100
what is happening is we have for writing

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,480
styles or the normal idea graphic

00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,160
symbols kanji or Hansy here my favorite

00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,650
country actually one of the first I

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,200
learned all the Japanese have to know it

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,120
is it's a standardized in six years it's

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,730
state depression it means because

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,730
because if you have to learn to write it

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,740
you get depressed actually is one of my

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,520
favorite anyway then this you Tigana

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,729
which is which is now it is used for

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:54,150
chromatic variance so so the main words

00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:56,970
the main setup of words as of the text

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,940
is a kanji and chromatic variants I

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:04,710
expressed or well Congrats Alice with

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:07,140
hiragana katakana is used for mostly for

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,140
foreign words often for scientific

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,240
expressions and then we have romaji

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,790
so Roman letters just mixed into the

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,710
text so these are mixed actually for

00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,900
those just a bit interested in the

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,240
history it was not always like this

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,310
so when I read old mathematical papers

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,610
in Japanese it's the other way around so

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,440
in old papers katakana was used for the

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,419
running text and hiragana for foreign

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,020
words which looks now it is completely

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:37,260
strange but well that's reality and it's

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:42,570
funny to read them that yeah so it has

00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:45,300
changed considerable all the time so

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:49,440
what I mentioned before there is also

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,690
setting directions I think I don't know

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,009
I assume mainland China I know that

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,990
there's practically no vertical

00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,659
typesetting anymore besides that word is

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,300
meant in some places what I've seen in

00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:03,120
Taiwan there are a lot of books I said

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,520
vertically so there are two typical ways

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,000
of typesetting text the one is like what

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,129
we Western people are used to with Roman

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,770
it's just from left to right top to

00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,199
bottom and it's a book would be just

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,909
like a normal book but this is not the

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,409
only way actually there's vertical

00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:24,210
typesetting and in Japan most of the

00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:26,969
novels so everything that is really not

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,460
related to technically is set vertically

00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:31,650
and also from right to left you start

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,020
here and you write in this direction and

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:37,319
also books start from well in this

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,509
direction this extends also to if you if

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,250
you're a book readers or something that

00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,940
also they are you you just tap on the

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,830
other side just to block so that's

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,259
things that this is very common in Japan

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,449
I don't know how far it is in Taiwan I

00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,940
didn't just know from several trips to

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:57,960
to mainland China that there was a that

00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,330
there it is hardly used anymore okay

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,419
so you have seen already examples of

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,130
mixing Latin letters into the text so

00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,469
there are a lot of ways to do this

00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,270
actually I think on the first day

00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,219
already someone asked me so how do you

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,949
do this so there are a lot of ways so

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:16,080
one way is if there are like three

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,479
letter or if you let us then you just

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,069
place them when they are vertically

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,240
believe it's horizontally then it is

00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:23,460
easy well there's nothing to discuss

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,979
when it's vertically you just place them

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,279
in the same line and standing up right

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:33,750
and right in this direction this is used

00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:35,729
for short abbreviation but sorry for

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,099
short abbreviation but too long that

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:41,969
they can fit horizontal so this is one

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:44,730
way that is commonly used for longer

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:48,029
words this is the standard way so you

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,160
you just turn the word to the right why

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:54,510
is this so polarized is possible because

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,180
as in Japanese as in in any western

00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:00,030
language Roman letters we don't

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,460
words not letter pi letter but we read

00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:05,490
words by their appearance actually if

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:08,190
you study a bit you read words by one of

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:11,970
the recognizing thing is the rhythm of

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,270
up so over the so the parts going above

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,790
the bar as here and below the baseline

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:21,420
so this seemed so this makes it very

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:24,690
easy to read short part so short words

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,400
or one two three words in in this kind

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,350
of typesetting for a long a text it

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,140
would be completely impossible to do you

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,780
have to turn but well for a single word

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:39,090
there's a another thing for very short

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:42,450
like distances disused for years is that

00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:44,490
you put the numbers into like the frame

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,590
of the country and fit it in so this is

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,290
very common writing style so this is a

00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:53,730
say when you just write the year in this

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:56,960
time I just mention here so many of the

00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:00,090
information here and this is also photos

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:11,550
yeah but it enters in my mouth sorry

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:15,690
what should I do should I eat it is this

00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:19,050
bed so for those interested see the the

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:22,380
w3 has a very nice description of most

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,270
of the problems here and very detail

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,100
this is not also for Japanese also for

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,820
Chinese traditional and and modern

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,860
Japanese traditional Chinese and

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,200
simplified Chinese there are three

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,650
descriptions here that are very helpful

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:51,150
for reading up if you want more details

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:53,640
about this so so as I said mixing the

00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,380
Roman letters so the default as I said

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,360
before in vertical typesetting is that

00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,420
you just turn it around you see this is

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,330
quite common stuff and then well there

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,160
is the spacing around this if you are

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,200
really into nice typesetting then you

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,940
care for what are the spaces here and

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,150
there at least in Japanese there are

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,870
clear rules the

00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:16,740
even standardized how much space you

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:21,870
should enter here between

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:25,510
kanji and Roman letter so in impact

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,550
vocabulary this would be the the size of

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,700
a kanji letter and here you put the

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,520
so-called X kanji skip I don't discuss

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,370
now the internals of it but yeah for the

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,890
tech implementation there are a few more

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,770
options here if you want to stay to the

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:45,430
grid type setting then well the idea is

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:48,100
that this you just fit the space around

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,470
in the full country with in a way that

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,290
well the number often fits exactly into

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,540
the width normal Japanese forms have for

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,810
example numbers but also all the letters

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:01,390
in two variants in proportional so that

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,339
for normal Roman and in this form that

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,690
they are exactly the size of the kanji

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,339
so that they can be used in this way

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:11,260
without breaking the grid types I think

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:13,510
so what are the rules for punctuation I

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,100
mean you I just don't want you to

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,790
remember all this I just want to give

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,370
you a feeling okay there is a lot of so

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,170
the same well knowledge and requirements

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,240
if you want to do proper typesetting

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:28,630
with this so for example the typical

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,660
thing is after comma here or after

00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:34,270
punctuation marks they are set on a half

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,430
kanji with and then there should be

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,350
another half with space so there should

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,240
be some opening and it should not be a

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,029
full width which often happens in

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,430
typesetting so we see here and here and

00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:48,370
here and here so these are the typical

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,640
examples for after full stocks and

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,770
commas half kanji with then for example

00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,959
if you mix in like

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,300
quotation marks so these are typical

00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,750
Roman quotation marks these are not

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,750
normal

00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:14,809
okay so okay here this is for example a

00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:19,519
Roman quotation mark this is not very

00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:21,980
common it's not very common in Japanese

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,529
but used especially nowadays Japanese

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,629
have their own quotation marks so also

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:30,379
in these guys you add in this case you

00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:33,319
add a half space between the surrounding

00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:35,689
kanji to just achieve proper spacing and

00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:37,579
then there are things like which are not

00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:40,009
common in Western typesetting is a

00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:42,819
center dot which should be say set into

00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:46,309
the middle of the page

00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:49,459
okay so what happens if it is not done

00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:51,709
right you can so in a text editor most

00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,600
of the text editors don't support proper

00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:57,110
spacing so what you would see you would

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,689
see a comma here and then like an

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:02,989
opening bracket in Japanese and then you

00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:05,179
have here a big wide-open gap the rules

00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:07,429
actually say that it should be only half

00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,529
of it and here we would have one half

00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,689
and another half so a full with open so

00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:14,660
the correct output would be dead that is

00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:17,360
top of the typesetting so for example

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,169
for the LibreOffice we hope that this

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,449
somehow gets implemented so how would

00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:26,689
this look like here so that would be ten

00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:29,499
Ganges in in proper typesetting so in

00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:33,110
the full length and if we add just

00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:35,589
parentheses or equivalent of parentheses

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,899
here then well they have the same width

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:41,059
that is nice for great typesetting but

00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:42,739
it's not what we expected in Japanese

00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:45,169
typesetting we don't want to see this

00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:48,350
because there is it's just too open it's

00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:51,169
just incoherent so if you have an idea

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,839
but Rome and typography what you would

00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:55,850
see if you have a very uneven spacing on

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,189
on the page you would see what is called

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,160
in type grill rivers going through the

00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:03,799
page because you have white open between

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,600
words to wide open space and that

00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:08,889
creates rivers of white going through

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,139
the page this is also very very as a as

00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:14,899
something that typographers book setters

00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:16,910
dislike a lot and so they try to get rid

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:18,050
of this and this is very similar reason

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,000
here that we don't

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,800
want to say open space here so the rules

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,019
is just here hafidh here I have in

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,019
between of this and that is definitely

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:34,670
about cliff widows and orphans so so for

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,980
example here this character is just one

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:39,649
overhang from a word they followed by a

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,160
parenthesis this is not really beautiful

00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:46,459
so what normally is that here we just

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:50,870
shift one word further on or just put

00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:52,850
the the whole next so I mean here this

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,130
is an opening bracket this is very nice

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,890
it's all on this on the right and here

00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,320
it's just hanging over this is if you

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,149
know orphans and widows in in Rome and

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,459
this is the same just with single

00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:07,670
characters you don't want a single word

00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:09,680
on the last line of a paragraph or you

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,290
don't want just one line of a paragraph

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,769
hanging over to the next page so these

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:18,040
are very very similar requirements to to

00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:21,290
what there is in Japanese typesetting

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,020
line adjustments well it's like setting

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:27,290
in block type in Roman letters is this

00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,760
it's it's a bit easier because we care

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,470
well it's not so easy but we have the

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,230
spacing between the words is a bit

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,079
flexible in in Latin typesetting so

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:39,200
normally people don't recognize up to

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,420
five percent of fluctuation between the

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,270
spacing in the white words in Japanese

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,450
because there is there is no space

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,279
between words so you have rather low

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,680
flexibility there's nothing you can

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,870
really push you cannot open up the space

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,060
between two words easily to to come on

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,579
so so that would be a real nice line

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,829
that just finishes here because yeah

00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:02,839
well that worked out but for example

00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:06,199
here because we have two punctuation

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,179
marks well and that means one one half

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,790
space here and here that we have an

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:12,980
overhang here so that is something which

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,470
is not very recommended so you cannot

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,929
print it's the same like you will not

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,150
see anything like this in Latin book as

00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:23,660
in a cooking tip typed in a Latin script

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:25,100
unless it is fine it's not so what is

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,959
normally done that for example this

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,760
space is a bit compressed and this space

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,730
is compressed this is one way that can

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,169
be done here's another example that is

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,300
very typically you don't want the

00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:37,309
opening bracket here lonely on the on

00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,809
the line at the end so you shift it over

00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:42,200
but then you have too much space before

00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:44,510
so well then what is normally done that

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:49,370
actually the space between the kanjis is

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:52,400
a bit open up so in in - terms for those

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:55,669
who know there is a bit of glue that is

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,260
extendable it's very low because it just

00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,600
it doesn't look right if it's too much

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,640
extended so if you move two characters

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,059
over this is already out that doesn't

00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,100
look good anymore

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:10,340
another line example here so we had for

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,050
example here we have two quotation marks

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,330
and then you have for example these

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,620
small characters I don't explain them

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,690
now what the meaning of this small

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,030
characters are some some katakana they

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,280
are a bit smaller they're a bit subset

00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,710
and so they change over also the spacing

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,580
again and that means that things are

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:31,160
quite complicated here here some space

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,140
is extended actually that the line works

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,780
out nicely here on this length side

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,790
again here we have two quotation marks

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,270
consecutive and here the space can be

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:43,850
compressed so there are a lot of tricks

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:46,220
we are typesetting system if they are

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,700
really good you can get really high

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,400
quality so this is the ideal reality is

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,320
unfortunately not completely just to

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,100
mention a bit the chinese typesetting

00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,220
rules so yes if you look at the w3c

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:04,730
consortium recomm recommendations for

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,929
chinese typesetting they are much if you

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,929
compare the Japanese and the Chinese

00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:10,850
it's they are much more unspecific they

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:13,040
just say yeah well they have the problem

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:17,300
with this ever and it something should

00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:20,510
be done I'm I was surprised that the

00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,160
Chinese rules are so lacks I would say

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,169
so they are not very strict in this

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,800
sense compared to the Japanese rules

00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:30,380
which are actually ISO standards also

00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,330
okay so that was a bit about what are

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,240
the problems in typesetting miss kanji

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,309
so this is standard what we have so next

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,750
is I want to history of the PTH family

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:42,220
so this is part of the pide code

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:45,640
whatever the PTH code is

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:48,190
just for giving you all and I'd hear

00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,140
about submit across an engine that was

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,140
more than 25 years developed an

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,970
independent a changing and for the

00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,880
Japanese here properly most of them

00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,539
remember the incantations here I just

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,390
tell you that every Japanese tech user

00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:07,120
patch the source code of TTA compiled

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,860
its own tech engine compiled all the

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,409
font matrix and all the stuff and

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:16,000
installed all this each and every page

00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:19,809
user up till 2010 it was I when I came

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,850
in October 2009 and I in October 2009 I

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,620
moved to Japan and you know November

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:33,159
2009 I attended the first tech

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:37,840
conference in Japan I was like no I mean

00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:40,000
I was like how much pain do they take I

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,159
mean this I mean if you compile Tito

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,030
Phenom machine it takes probably a few

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,650
an hour or something yeah and I guess

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:51,280
there were so many compilation errors

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:53,919
and problems so it it was impressive so

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,890
what is this PT I'm talking about so it

00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:00,370
was in 87 it was developed originally by

00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:03,210
entity called JPEG for those with a bit

00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,620
of history we had to attach in DB until

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,650
July requested removal four or five

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:11,559
years ago or something so that was the

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,020
first support where they tried to but

00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:16,150
what was the problem a Japanese formed

00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,940
like Chinese font has on average like

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,010
20,000 characters well 10,000 whatever

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,990
and that doesn't work with the normal

00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,960
tech engine where they limit now at this

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,510
is 256 so yeah that was a bit a problem

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,360
long before the introduction of exceed

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:34,110
agent lua de so Dane developed is

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,090
independent in 80s in the same year so

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:40,240
Aston worked as I call as a company in

00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:43,299
Tokyo the multiple extensions so that

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,890
you can actually use Japanese encodings

00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:46,690
so it was shift cheese from the

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:50,110
beginning nowadays most of them work

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:52,929
also beautif it in ninety the vertical

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:55,990
type set extension was aid added and it

00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:58,240
was named PA the the reason is

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:01,990
or called from publishing page so for

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,200
publishing in Japan in 93 the Qi

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:07,150
standard came out an industrial standard

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,690
for typesetting this is very close to

00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:12,850
what I mentioned before on the w3c page

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:15,660
but I cannot get it the Qi standard

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:19,630
because it costs too much money

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:22,270
Peter was in 95 then we pasted on page

00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,870
three zero and there is also P latex so

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:28,210
they laid the format based on Japanese

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:31,179
form phones all kind of formats so there

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:34,720
is a long development history there in

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:38,410
2003 I think one of the most commonly

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,280
used package Co tf2 to arbitrary Abbot

00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:44,679
to access arbitrary city key cliffs in a

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,860
font which is common because you know

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,270
there is this Han unification many

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,280
people don't like and then there are

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,340
many code points they are not easily

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,200
accessible so you want into a city as in

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,420
the city key formed you want this

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,870
especially for names in Japan that use

00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:05,830
sometimes quite complicated kanji in

00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:08,679
Tower 2006 - Timur sensei and developed

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:11,830
this PT page so based on Thomas s attack

00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:14,350
which was also a long time in PB n he

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:17,230
meet or dispatches that users can just

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:20,350
patch the stuff themself and this is

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:24,400
which later - P date life after Thomas s

00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:27,490
her stop developing anymore well further

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,860
steps in 2007 panic signs in Purim as

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,230
introduced as a uptake which is a unique

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,370
code because P th was solely based on

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:38,380
shift reason coding there are further

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:40,630
developments in 2008 in and something so

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,760
but what we have seen already most parts

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,190
of - it's a 16-bit extension the first

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,880
tech engine that supported this long

00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,800
before exceeded in Lua - nowadays it

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,059
supports various internal output

00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:58,240
encodings it has support for special

00:23:54,059 --> 00:24:01,870
kanji hanji font metrics or large number

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,820
of screws on different layers kerning

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,350
all these kind of problems in the clip

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,330
spacing between Japanese and

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,880
non-japanese so all these types this

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,470
this car I present it before so these

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,010
problems with spacing they were

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:19,970
implemented in this engine and line

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:24,110
spacing something but okay um that was

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:27,409
as I said till 2009 when I attended the

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:29,950
Japanese tech conference and I was still

00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:32,840
then already since several years

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:35,029
maintaining page life upstream also

00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,549
developing with kalbarri and I said no

00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:41,960
that cannot be the future it's that's

00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:44,659
forbidden and I think it was yeah in so

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,860
2009 at the tech conference I I heard

00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,659
this the first time was shocked

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,019
completely and I said no that cannot be

00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:53,720
and so 2010 in April that was the start

00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:56,870
I pushed with kokuto sensei Akira and

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,789
there's the Jade so all the PT not all

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,740
the P tech stuff initially the basic

00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:05,529
engines into the the page life

00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:08,269
subversion and dead started quite some

00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:10,669
development so up coming to take life

00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:14,570
2010 that was the first release that

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:15,769
included PJ the engine and J's gases

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,159
from accumulations

00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:23,470
so was released in June 2010 included

00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:26,590
most basic pace Japanese tech support

00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:29,659
that was not perfect but ok it was

00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:33,529
people could just in start his life on

00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:35,149
like 15 different architecture and

00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:37,429
operating system combination from

00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:40,669
Windows make Solaris iooks

00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:43,539
whatever with all kind of operating

00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:47,210
systems without compiling themselves

00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:50,600
2000 l 11 I have well I have overslept

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:52,880
somehow in 2012 together with the

00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,789
Japanese tech group we pushed update so

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,059
the Unicode version and EPE update which

00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:01,760
includes the EP extension including

00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:04,490
other packages or this main packages for

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,289
that I important for typesetting yet OTF

00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:08,809
package that's for the accessing

00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:11,809
arbitrary Kluth and Louetta shade so

00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:13,519
like which is the future so in 2012 I

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:16,399
would say it was the first time that it

00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:20,240
was complete support for cgk typesetting

00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:21,890
in take life so I will talk about seeing

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,960
key options

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,600
later on but that was the first time and

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,520
it's I just speak about upstream but I'm

00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,120
also that the package of the Debian

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:34,730
packages and we had since 2009 we have

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,800
paid live packages in Debian first in

00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,740
parallel with static and now only take

00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,480
life so practically know practically

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,930
everything that this discussed here is

00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,550
also one to one available in Debian

00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:50,120
later on so in the following years this

00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:52,910
just normal package updates we improved

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,960
over the years a lot especially for the

00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:58,700
phone support phone support for not only

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,950
Japanese phone Chinese phones as a

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,500
traditional and simplified and Korean

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,600
phones integration with ghost trip that

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:10,250
we can set up ghost trip automatically

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:13,310
we integrated well Japanese version of

00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:16,430
Mita post-trauma that was in 2015 so

00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:19,070
it's nowadays it has come down a lot so

00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:21,050
it's normal development nowadays so what

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,990
are the status in other countries

00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:26,080
outside of China so

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:29,360
from my experience and I hope that the

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,510
non-japanese of CK here in the room can

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,940
correct me I talking to them most of

00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:38,150
people you succeed and don't use

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:41,150
anything else Sita is nice it works nice

00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:44,960
it relies on the font providing the

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:47,240
proper type setting which is not

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,520
necessarily available if you use for

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,800
example Japanese with sedation you get

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,710
per standard normally most people get

00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:57,940
the IPA phones there would be it would

00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,650
be not up to a standard I would expect I

00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,720
don't know enough about Chinese I have

00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,970
to see but I know that most Chinese on

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:10,310
at least mainland China you succeed just

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:12,020
as is well SS it's B if you want

00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,670
specifically outreaches in whist

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,410
exceeding engine you need the proper

00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,160
support of the OTA phones which is

00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:20,840
nowadays with with the libraries we have

00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,910
not so bad but the problem is that the

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,390
information in the ODF forms are not

00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:28,790
necessarily good over the last few years

00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:30,620
actually uptake especially update the

00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,850
Unicode variant has been picked up not

00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,230
only in Japan

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,270
well Japan was it was very common

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:38,930
already but also in Korea China

00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:41,930
many places because the the problems are

00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:45,220
the same and so it was picked up and we

00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:47,750
have nowadays for example a lot of

00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:51,470
independent development support in from

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:54,140
the Korean side and there is also a new

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,380
development evelopment just it was

00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,730
called Asian PTA who are PTA ng

00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:02,420
unfortunately the Chinese developer has

00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:04,910
stopped doing anything actually was just

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,710
Rebecca me anyway so generally the

00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,600
support from it was originally

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:11,480
everything Japanese the chat the support

00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,670
for non-japanese languages has changed

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,180
completely so this is an example of a

00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:19,670
document intake written without any

00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:22,010
common sequences everything is typed as

00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:25,220
you see it here with Russian with Ange

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,900
with Greek check with all these

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,240
languages with umlauts in German

00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,980
everything is typed as is in the in the

00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,540
text source code you just switch

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,110
language with bubble and you get the

00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:38,450
output properly so uptake is nowadays

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,700
able to do all these kind of things plus

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:44,840
vertically typesetting plus proper type

00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:48,350
sitting for Japanese stuff so what about

00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,330
the font support so we have the first it

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:52,640
was called che phones Japanese phones a

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,500
package I started and now it is

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,140
developed together with the with all the

00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,230
other Japanese developers it was just

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:03,620
because PJ update they don't go direct

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:07,910
to PDF they use they go to DVI and then

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:12,140
use DVI PDF PDF M X whatever so the same

00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:14,810
nowadays to import to include your OTF

00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,300
phones true type fonts ot iPhones so

00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,550
what's the current status in within

00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,410
Debian reaching missing take life and

00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:24,020
that's also deepen because it's the same

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,090
so we have four Japanese the IP ain't IP

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,910
x phones are both included in that life

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:31,250
and also in in DB on so they can be used

00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:34,160
straight ahead for typesetting japanese

00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:37,880
we have support for these other phones

00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:40,910
manga who may they are free that you can

00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,430
install them they are not included in

00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:45,500
that life and we have support for

00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:48,410
various commercial phones that the

00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,070
Microsoft phones we have to you hear a

00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,259
keynote open

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,059
Kousaka so for the Japanese they will

00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:55,309
know all these names these are all

00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,870
commercial fonts or are provided for

00:30:55,309 --> 00:31:00,860
example like the you phones are provided

00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:03,320
with April with make OS so it does

00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,779
create request for supporting these

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,639
phones for simplified Chinese we have

00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:09,409
the African fund all phones posing

00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:12,860
didn't take life and installed so you

00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:15,380
can if you use GTX AC 8k whatever you

00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:19,220
can types it immediately simplified

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:21,769
Chinese or traditional Chinese the CJK

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,360
uniforms are as far as and they are not

00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:24,679
including take life so not in the

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,440
packages I'm not sure if they're

00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,509
packaged for Debian they are free and we

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,029
have support for several other again the

00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:35,450
Microsoft phones found oral or found

00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:37,429
commercial phones which well traditional

00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:40,730
Chinese the situation is very similar to

00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:44,840
simplify it more commercial options from

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:46,490
Adobe also and for Korean the pigment in

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,789
phones are included in take life and

00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:52,039
also in the Indian and have support for

00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:54,440
the the usual commercial phones from

00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:57,200
Microsoft Apple and Adobe so all this

00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,230
the commercial support is not included

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,019
in that life that is well we actually we

00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,120
merged it even out of their life faith

00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:08,840
Life has in principle the policy to

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,659
follow the SMS guidelines or even the

00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:15,559
DFS jjigae guidelines with a few

00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:19,460
exceptions where I always the the

00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:22,100
fundamentalist in Indian but anyway we

00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,620
so we removed so the support for the

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,570
phones is free it's open source but we

00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,519
don't include it in take life because

00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,230
it's only support for commercial

00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,779
products we don't include it in take

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,789
life and so it's also not included in

00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:37,809
deben but can be easily installed it's

00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:39,250
just a few list of files to be installed

00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:42,320
okay

00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,970
very short because most people don't

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,120
know this so font embedding is

00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:49,070
configured in a certain program it's

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,399
called update map and there are nowadays

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:54,169
that it's a long time that has changed

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,690
now since it's three years or something

00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:59,210
especially embedding configuration for

00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,990
the four languages GE for Japanese

00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,910
simplified Chinese traditional German

00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,820
and he's in Korean so all these fonts

00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:08,950
can be embedded defined for each of

00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,570
these classes you can define which one

00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:13,300
you want to embed or you can say no

00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,850
embed and let the fewer choose the fonts

00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,380
which is also very common for Japanese

00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,230
who are interested there is also the

00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,120
gist 2004 very and can you choose which

00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,250
changes some of the form as of the

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,620
country and there's a script for

00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:30,100
automatically setting up or allowing you

00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:33,520
to easily configure font embedding for

00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:35,500
the fonts them okay so more or less at

00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,929
the end so what's the current status so

00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,120
Japan in Japan so in the Japanese days

00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:42,309
to take Japanese Japanese stage

00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,980
developer group you can find on text

00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:47,140
chippy we have our own euro of take life

00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,330
we have our own extra take life

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,780
repository for testing release for

00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:55,330
commercial stuff development has most

00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:58,150
before like up to like a few years ago

00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:03,400
it was all in private repositories on

00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:06,340
private websites I have I have business

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,870
creation of the Japanese take developer

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,970
community we have now moved everything

00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,639
to github everything you can follow

00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:15,520
their you can join in and helped also

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,560
interest or everything has also finally

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,080
gotten consistent uploads to see tan

00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,149
which was one of the big problems in the

00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,129
initial years like ten years ago because

00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:27,250
people in Japan is developers had a

00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:31,210
tendency not to upload to Seaton because

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:33,040
I don't know why anyway so that has

00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:37,179
changed completely I'm very happy about

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,040
this so in I would say from the on the

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,800
Japanese side it is now really like

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,070
optimal I mean one reason is that that

00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,440
of course I'm a tech life maintainer so

00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:51,070
I have a good bridge between this and

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,220
can care for integration on the Korean

00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:57,250
side there we had the big page user

00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:59,350
group conference in in Tokyo in 2013

00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:02,500
there were a lot of Korean participants

00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:04,990
and I somehow managed to convince them

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,850
also to contribute their development to

00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,530
take life there up to then they had

00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:13,720
their own repository everything

00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:15,970
independent often hard to access this

00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,980
has changed it is now everything in Apps

00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:20,109
take life in collection land Korean in

00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:24,270
PBM package which would be paid lifelong

00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:26,560
Korean so practically all the nest

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:29,490
requirements for Korean typesetting are

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,440
also included nowadays in intake life

00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:34,780
for Chinese I have to say I have never

00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,640
heard any requests from any Chinese

00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:40,990
neither on the mailing list nor

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,460
privately okay I don't know maybe they

00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,050
are just happy we succeed agent

00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:48,820
everything is fine so that's the current

00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:54,220
state life and that means also in Debian

00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:56,349
I didn't put a slide here I forgot

00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,900
actually I wanted to mention here before

00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:01,810
about the future is the future moves

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,440
very strongly to lure take it's an

00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:07,599
extension of the NJ engine with lure as

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,030
an embedded interpreter so there are

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,150
hooks into the typesetting system of -

00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:16,090
miss Lu it is already used a lot in

00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:18,400
context in some other typesetting system

00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,830
and there's a package to attach a that

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,530
is now I use on a daily basis for our

00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,810
reports it is excellent you get direct

00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,420
PDF output you can use all the fonts and

00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:30,510
it because just to use lure for the

00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,980
requirement complex parts and and

00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:36,070
command this is in heaven assistance

00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:38,320
intake life since 2015 a heavy

00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:40,810
development permanently improving so I

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,730
recommend everyone to interested in

00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:45,010
Japanese typesetting to look at this

00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,349
package okay that's all from my side

00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,619
thanks for your attention and I'm open

00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:52,420
to questions suggestion and criticism

00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:54,990
from more experienced people in me

00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,990
thanks a lot

00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:12,080
I have two questions one is is there a

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,780
back best practice starting point for a

00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,970
correct typesetting and Japanese with

00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:20,140
Tesh and the other question is how's the

00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:24,890
support of the sadhana me funds

00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:31,820
respectively the wine linux fork of it

00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:33,500
we gothic sazanami and we gothic ok the

00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:37,340
first question I mean I wrote a blog

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,230
about typesetting Japanese we stay very

00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,610
simple I thought this is something I

00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,200
didn't want to do here I don't didn't

00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,600
want to do it tutorial how to write

00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,450
simple stuff where I discussed like

00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:52,460
encoding problems and what you write

00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:56,000
I think the best practice is we just

00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,400
take the loop hae documentation and make

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,730
a simple file with use package one of

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,040
the Louetta classes Lu @xj gases and

00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:07,130
then you get everything for free more or

00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,960
less and that is if if if you want an

00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,680
easy start this is like a for a liner

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,680
for a hello world everything running out

00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,560
of the box on debian on any take life

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,020
installation is my recommendation if you

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,760
want to start typesetting in Japanese if

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,680
you want to go to vertical typesetting

00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,190
then it's probably still better to use

00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:31,220
PJ update which makes it but it's still

00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:33,200
not complicated but where I start I

00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:36,730
recommend you attache because it is so

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:43,010
smooth and easy to use for typesetting

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:45,620
the other no support no I don't know you

00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,450
probably can load them and see if it

00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,400
works so you can use see - of course and

00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,800
load the phone you can lose looat edge

00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,520
to using to load an arbitrary font lua

00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,070
the hugheses

00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,260
phone spec to load you can load an

00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,270
arbitrary font I have no experience with

00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:05,330
it I don't know what would come out of

00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:07,510
it but I'm doubtful about the quality of

00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:10,430
the phones so but

00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:14,630
that doesn't mean you cannot use it

00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:16,010
I'm crutch if it if it's a normal TTFN

00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,410
wand or something as far as I remember

00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:20,089
actually I used it for a Garmin device

00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:23,960
to hack a Garmin device so I should know

00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:25,609
it it's long time ago so you should be

00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,799
able to just use it straight ahead with

00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:30,760
Luther J by selecting the formed in in

00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,760
f1 spec type yeah

00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:47,120
you suggest you recommended low-tech for

00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:50,810
things so I use I don't do a lot of CJK

00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:53,120
stuff but just for personal hobby stuff

00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:55,660
I often use sort of multiple character

00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:59,150
sets and one of the nice things about

00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:01,760
z-tech is that you can have it select

00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:04,100
the font automatically by the code block

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,750
I haven't figured out a way to do that

00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:18,050
with low attack yet is there a way to do

00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:20,840
that I cannot answer I believe there is

00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:25,550
but I wouldn't I wouldn't guarantee you

00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:27,440
but you meant by it's all UTF but it's

00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:30,350
by different Unicode code block right

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,120
yeah it's not different encoding but if

00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:35,540
yeah you did but it's it's all block

00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:37,550
yeah it's it's all utf-8 and you learn

00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:41,960
so instead of babel with poly glossier

00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:44,000
what languages are and then i I believe

00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,040
there is a way okay

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,620
I would have to check it out fair I

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,970
think there is but yeah I say that

00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,420
cannot really but it's true this is a

00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:56,240
nice feature selecting fonts

00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,070
automatically based on the unicode

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,310
language block yes a nice feature I

00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,310
agree

00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:22,700
thank you have a good presentation I

00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:33,230
love all takes users so I remember about

00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:41,160
Omega project so I is that I know I

00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:46,799
googled about it so it has first and

00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:49,769
thumpa thumpa integrated to do analytics

00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:53,069
so I can I can explain you the world

00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:55,740
story so Tom place and jung-hyun below

00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:57,720
developed Omega I actually I remember

00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,839
the first time I came to Japan in 2001

00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,549
as I was invited to the conference women

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,950
telling novelisation because I've wrote

00:42:02,549 --> 00:42:06,690
support in Omega for writing Tibetan I

00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:08,400
study Tibetan and university and I

00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:11,430
wanted to write a bit and just write

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,329
ahead in my editor and so I wrote

00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:19,619
support so omega had 2x2 interesting

00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:24,690
extension the one was it allowed very

00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:27,569
free the definition of the typesetting

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,279
direction so you could freely I mean

00:42:27,569 --> 00:42:32,369
which is was never used in this

00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:35,279
generality but you can see start at the

00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:37,319
top then go to the left or right or

00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:39,569
start the department then go up were

00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:41,460
left and then you can also so you can

00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:43,499
specify where this is and you can also

00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,319
see the character should be turned or

00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:48,660
should not pattern so TLT so that was a

00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:51,239
very nice idea that was included into

00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53,130
Lua Tech I think that you can use this

00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:57,349
direction in the same brain loads the

00:42:53,130 --> 00:43:00,569
other big part of Omega was they had an

00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:02,549
finite state automaton plugged into the

00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:05,009
input so you could write it was called

00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:06,989
Omega translation process so you could

00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:09,390
write more or less a finite state like a

00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:11,999
grandma that translates stuff as I used

00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:13,710
it for typesetting Tibetan because you

00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:16,859
have to reorder a lot of stuff that you

00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:18,930
get the right glyphs that has not been

00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:20,730
carried over to Lou a day because there

00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,430
are better ways now because we have now

00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,470
Lua as black in there so

00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:27,300
you can do the same thing in Lua and it

00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,119
is done so for example if you look at

00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,160
the Devanagari typesetting or well

00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:33,210
tibetan support is nobody has written it

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,309
because i don't have time

00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,109
but the negara typesetting there is

00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:39,420
support for it because it is very

00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:42,270
important in India so there you also

00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:45,059
have you have to switch character input

00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,859
in houma nicest letters then you have to

00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:48,089
switch the stuff around that you get the

00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:51,150
right order of the letters in the

00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:53,300
sanskrit in the naga so that is done

00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,559
nowadays in lua so this part of this

00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:59,220
omega translation process was not

00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:00,510
carried over there so this were the

00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,059
parts that were carried over into

00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:05,280
Louetta this or in addition Omega

00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:07,920
project ID to both John and Young he

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,470
just stopped developing Tron moved on to

00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,680
completely different things it was later

00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:16,530
in picked up in a different engine it's

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,859
called Aleph I'm not revert this Aleph

00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:23,250
is still included in that life Aleph is

00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:26,880
so to see and fixed Omega with a bit

00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:29,760
improvement was it was an Italian who I

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,770
forgot the name sorry and it is also a

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,170
format for it there's also lammott which

00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:37,140
is well it's just all hebrew letters

00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:40,200
selamat for the for the latest format so

00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:42,329
you still can use if you still have all

00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,280
documents that uses omega translation

00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:46,710
process you can still principally use

00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,859
them with Oliphant lammott they are in

00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:52,559
tough life they are all included but

00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:55,530
there is no development going on

00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,359
nobody's interested anymore because well

00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,770
it was a very nice at the end worked for

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:03,240
a long time quite nicely

00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:06,440
it is now superseded i would say yeah it

00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,440
does in fact thank you

00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,060
well if there are no further questions

00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:23,400
we are at zero I was just indicated zero

00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,040
time now actually one minute so one last

00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,440
question if not them thanks a lot for

00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,000
the attention and I anyway if you have

00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,820
any questions or problems with

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,360
typesetting I mean I get often from the

00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:38,070
Debian documentation team I get requests

00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,540
about problems when typesetting doesn't

00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,940
work out because actually this is an

00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:44,070
icing on the TBN typesetting tube in

00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,440
documentation because they request a lot

00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:48,300
of features and a lot of languages and a

00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,450
lot of translations that means there is

00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,490
well we have to keep up with this this

00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:56,070
is very nice and so if there any

00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:59,430
questions requests wishes

00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:00,810
actually I my biggest request is

00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:05,250
actually to the Taiwanese and Chinese

00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:07,440
here in the hope that I hear wishes from

00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,820
them because I want to improve support

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,950
for them if there is something to

00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,870
improve I mean I cannot do something out

00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,170
of the pegs okay thanks a lot to

00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:21,659
everyone

00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:21,659
