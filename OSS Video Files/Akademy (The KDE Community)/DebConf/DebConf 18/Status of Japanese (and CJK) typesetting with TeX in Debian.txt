The support for typesetting Japanese (or any CJK language) in TeX in particular TeX Live, has been considerably improving over the last few years. From practical non-existence 10 years ago where every Japanese TeX user was used to download and compile packages (pteTeX, pTeXLive) to a simple `apt-get install texlive-lang-japanese` was a long way.

In this talk we recall a bit of the history of Japanese TeX in (Debian) TeX Live and give an introduction to the particularities of Japanese typographic rules and how they are implemented in TeX. We will shortly touch on how to typeset multilingual CJK documents in TeX using upTeX and LuaTeX, and report on the current state of CJK font support in TeX concerning free and commercial fonts.
