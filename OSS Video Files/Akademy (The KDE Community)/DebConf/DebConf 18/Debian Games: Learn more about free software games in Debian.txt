https://debconf18.debconf.org/talks/122-debian-games-learn-more-about-free-software-games-in-debian/

This talk is aimed for an audience who wants to learn more about games in Debian. How many are there, how can I find them, what kind of games are available and who maintains them? This presentation will give you a broad overview of the current state of Debian Games. It should give you some ideas what free software games are, who creates them, how they differ from commercial titles and why we should care about them.

While the main focus of this talk will be on free software games, I will also discuss tools and programs that make it possible to play commercial games on Linux that were released for different platforms, some of them long forgotten.

hello welcome to my talk today I want to

00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,770
talk about getting gains and free stuff

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,070
against oblivion

00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:22,520
and the status of games in general where

00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:26,390
my I'm a Debian developer from Germany

00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:31,340
and I've been using Debian since 2002

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:35,030
and 2012 I started to contribute to

00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:39,320
Debian one of my first packages was a

00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:41,300
game of course at the same time I also

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,899
started a little project called you know

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:49,329
Stuart D where you can play multiplayer

00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:54,410
online games from the divine repository

00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:57,980
including games such as of marina or the

00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:05,900
battle for the restarts T worlds and so

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:07,850
on I contributed to as as I said I

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,730
started to continue to Debian in 2012

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,820
and at the moment I maintain or

00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:17,630
contribute to around 500 packages mostly

00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:23,180
games and Java packages but also to the

00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:25,790
long-term support section of Debian so

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,610
what can you expect from the next 45

00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,140
minutes first of all I want to talk

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,710
about the fundamental differences

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:37,910
between commercial games and free

00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:43,520
software games because most people think

00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:47,150
that commercial games are the norm which

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,110
they are and they don't know very much

00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:55,280
about free software games so they ask

00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:57,620
can i play in X on Linux and ten years

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,760
ago I would have said mmm

00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:04,430
will be difficult nowadays I tend to say

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,370
rather yes it is possible it was

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,259
definitely better than it was ten years

00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,230
ago

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:14,040
I also wants to talk about how you can

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,410
find games in

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,920
that's not as easy as it sounds there

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,230
are multiple tools available for you and

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:26,940
there's also project called deviant

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:31,319
games planned I want to explain why we

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,860
put some games in the main repository in

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,330
Debian salmon contra and Summit non-free

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,410
what is the difference and why are they

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,840
there why are there games which we

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,150
cannot package at all

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:51,510
I will tell something about new games of

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:53,940
Debian town and well at the end I also

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,099
want to explore some new ideas what we

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,840
can do to improve the status of Debian

00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:05,160
games if you look at the global game

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:09,840
marketplace you will see that they deal

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:14,129
with thousands of games which are

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,840
million dollar business many of them

00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:17,790
interact millions of players around the

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,120
world they are big titles blockbuster

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:26,430
games so-called AAA titles which

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,079
consists of for example dota or

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:34,260
counter-strike SimCity Call of Duty

00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:39,269
watch and so on and these games attract

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:43,549
a lot of people and well they make a lot

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:46,680
of money with it I've told us before

00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:48,959
last year Montreal there is there was a

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,599
project it was called the

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,639
next-generation multiplayer online

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,019
role-playing game by Blizzard

00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,030
Entertainment and well they decided

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:03,380
after they spent three years developing

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,910
the game that it was not good enough and

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,870
before he made made a decision they

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:13,380
employed about hundreds developers and

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,220
trainers of artwork software developers

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,769
who worked full time on the project and

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:23,310
that made this decision ok it's not good

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,940
enough and it took the assets all the

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,490
images sounds and what

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:31,270
have done before and made a new game and

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,060
that's called overwatch now which is

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,250
quite a popular game again Blizzard

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,790
Entertainment gets it mostly right all

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:43,390
the time we have four or five franchises

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:47,890
but they always attract millions of

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:49,810
players make a lot of money with it so

00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:53,320
if you take a look at Faust games or

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,930
free software games instead you will see

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,490
that the revenue who loves these games

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,040
is close to zero

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:05,230
most developers receive no money at all

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:08,050
or well received no donations and solve

00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:13,050
them if they are lucky day well cancel

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:16,900
the game on Steam or very very very few

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:19,570
can attract enough people to support a

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:23,010
crowdfunding campaign campaign for

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,840
example 0ad

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:29,050
tried that and they could raise some

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:33,070
money but that's the exception and not

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:38,230
at all successful games attract

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:40,470
thousands of players for example well my

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:44,440
test is a very popular game nowadays

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:50,110
it's a clone of my draft but it has a

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:52,050
very active community and obviously it's

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,310
not as big as minecraft but it's still

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:59,410
compared to other games a very active

00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:03,430
community you also have to say okay

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:08,650
most games are a niche that's it's a

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:13,380
truth it's not not as big as commercial

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:17,100
games of course just because nobody

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:21,040
funds those projects these are hobbyists

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:25,000
developers who create the game in their

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,790
free time and they spare time but yeah

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,040
you make the money with it so you can't

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,860
expect the same amount of quality that

00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:37,030
you see in commercial game son when I

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,970
talk to people who are only now

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:44,130
yes they are bidding disappointed but

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,130
you have to see this in perspective

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,500
well there are good arguments for free

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,350
soccer games the most important one for

00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:02,010
me is that we have the source code and

00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:05,470
also in most cases the right to modify

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:08,860
images the sounds all the assets so that

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:14,290
means even in ten years time it is

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:17,680
possible to to develop a new game or to

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:21,360
modify the game or as we seen as we have

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,360
seen in the past it is possible that

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:29,560
that we that we can maintain games for

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:33,400
twenty years or longer for example free

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,380
set was developed in 1996 I guess and so

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,530
to this day 20 years later it is still

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:42,280
to Alex and there's a vibrant community

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:47,320
around it and that wouldn't be possible

00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:51,130
if sources were closed it is also a

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:55,390
great way to learn more about developing

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:58,330
in general and it is not only meant for

00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,490
developers but also people who are not

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:06,700
into coding but more into creating

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:08,410
artwork can share their work and it is

00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,640
easily accessible for them in my opinion

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,860
and this artwork is reusable for other

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:23,190
projects and that's also impossible with

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:23,190
proprietary games of course so if you

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,150
think about think about it there are

00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,900
game libraries which are not only used

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:34,450
for games they can be used for

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:39,099
everything and a special for projects

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:43,330
which like like the open robotics

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:46,810
project there was a story I packaged

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,550
once free Orion and I needed bullets to

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:52,140
complete the

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:59,780
well it is a 3d multiphysics library who

00:08:52,140 --> 00:09:05,100
are you which which makes it possible to

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:08,550
simulate deformities and yeah computes

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,850
different objects who with each other in

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,320
space and open robotics someone from

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,170
nova robotics contacted me and said

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,160
ain't cool youth package bullet and he

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:22,710
uses for our buttocks project and you

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,630
can see that not only the libraries are

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,430
meant for for games but can also be used

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,920
for different projects and that's quite

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:33,840
cool so we are not only packaging for a

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:38,400
niche but it can be reused there were

00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,260
another important aspect is that it is

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,490
excellent integrated into Debian which

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:47,580
you not always have with commercial

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:51,870
games so we applied the same rules as

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:56,670
well other programs and for example we

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:59,610
we are very we are very careful when it

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:02,790
comes to licensing we review not only

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:07,710
the code but also all the assets and as

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:12,380
that is very time-consuming tasks but it

00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:17,880
also is very important that we only have

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:26,490
software and artwork that is free

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:29,460
available yeah major games communities I

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,140
mentioned before mind tests and the

00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,980
battles of is not but there's also super

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:37,620
tax card semantic and see your ad and

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,330
research these are the biggest

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,480
communities in the free software world

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:46,830
at the moment I thank you and they are

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,960
between 10 and 20 years old Mayan test

00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:53,150
as with young girls only 5 or 6 years

00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,920
old but they are very active and yeah

00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:58,520
they still produce a lot of new content

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,520
these days

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:06,529
I have counted 600 different games and

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,120
emulators last time I checked that's the

00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:12,829
number of games reached of the games of

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:17,779
Debian and all software and artwork

00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:20,569
complies with the DSG most games are

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:23,449
written in C and C++ we also have some

00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:27,110
ball games or support known as frozen

00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:30,259
bubbles one Husker game has ranked heads

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:34,550
and a few Java games we are very proud

00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:42,470
of that we also have d games which are

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:44,029
quite rare and the maintainer of GCC or

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,860
suggested that we should pour them to

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,170
Java

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,819
because it hits to support D but they

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,500
are very great if you want to look at

00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:58,220
them you can find them on the package

00:11:51,500 --> 00:12:03,380
games - shoot him up and well they are

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,810
really fun I think popcorn what one to

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,199
tell the solutions for popular games

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:12,230
this does a good number I think yes

00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:16,100
because even more popular applications

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:20,630
outside of the game universe can have

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,189
much fewer installations hmm what I

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,569
should mention too is that we are

00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:30,110
talking about PC games mostly because

00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:32,720
web and html5 games are quite rare in

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,019
Debian as I know there's only one game

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,519
and the archive which could be possibly

00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:41,180
played on in a web browser

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:48,430
that's Cave Express but it's quite hard

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:54,800
to sustain the toolchain so you need to

00:12:48,430 --> 00:13:01,519
maintain compiler that compiles the C++

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:04,579
code into JavaScript and this hasn't

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,490
worked all the time so yeah if you have

00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:12,450
two tasks please do it

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:14,900
um so one of the most difficult problems

00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:17,790
and Debian is how can you find games I

00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:20,850
say this because ten years ago I tried

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:25,050
to get an overview what games we have in

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:27,240
Debian and this was not very easy

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,600
because most people suggested to use the

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:36,480
terminal and to use tools like depth or

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:38,700
aptitudes to find them and well not all

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,030
the users are into this kind of stuff

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:45,240
they would prefer something more

00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:48,030
graphical so nowadays I would suggest

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,500
that they use tools like synaptic you

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:54,690
know Software Center or if you are into

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:59,550
KDE can you use them you could also try

00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:01,790
plasma discover on view on yeah why do I

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,790
say that

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:13,920
it is most people think that users of

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,720
games are also how could even users most

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,120
people think Devon is about service or

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,280
it's about this desk of environment of

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:25,650
this desk for Holland but people who

00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:28,110
want to play games are most often very

00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:30,180
casual users so they don't want to spend

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:34,860
much time to find the games table just

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,810
to relax and enjoy themselves and yeah

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,900
we should make definitely easier for

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,190
them there's another project which I

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,460
mentioned before it's called Debian

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:47,550
games planned and I come to that in a

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:50,820
few minutes so let's take a look at non

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:54,240
Software Center um you can see a lot of

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:57,660
symbols you can see games game names and

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,660
games descriptions what you can also see

00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:05,370
is that some of them are translated and

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:07,410
some are not so the language which you

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:14,089
cannot understand that's possibly

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:17,360
Klingon and you can see that for example

00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:21,980
there's the game killbots hasn't

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:25,579
translated the text and well then there

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,279
are others which are in English so this

00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:31,399
is bit confusing why is that why is it

00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:34,790
so those information are derived from

00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:40,279
so-called Desktop files or upstream data

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:42,470
files and most games do not ship such a

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,240
stream data files so we derive all the

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:48,290
information who testifies but there they

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,620
are put it in slated so most of them are

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,809
owned in English and few of them contain

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,809
German Cohen's or French comments or

00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:58,790
spanish comments but i know of very

00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:00,829
little games for example who are

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,550
translated game descriptions which are

00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:07,069
in chinese so in an ideal world you

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,949
would see that all these my cans and all

00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:12,110
these games would show chinese

00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:15,319
translation text but we don't have that

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,990
yet so there's a lot of work to do in

00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:22,040
the translation area and at the moment

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:25,249
we are not there what you can also see

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,730
is the difference between icons most of

00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:31,220
them look quite good I think crisp and

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:33,350
clear but take a look at director or

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:37,129
lure of the tempest or for example

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:40,339
mugging for the game on the left the

00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:44,379
resolution is very poor or they are just

00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:48,559
screenshots so they can be improved

00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:51,319
because people tend to play games or are

00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:54,079
directed to games with nice icons so I

00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:56,329
more eye candy is always good but if you

00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,019
don't have a good eye can people mostly

00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:04,939
think aim that I can means it's not a

00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:08,929
good game so here we can improve - mmm

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:12,319
the devil gives blends that's something

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:14,720
I started in 2014 I guess and that's

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,299
just a collection of meteor packages so

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,970
if you wonder ok you know the tools now

00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:21,839
genome software's and muon and so on and

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,370
you can also use

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,189
attitude but then there's another

00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:30,179
alternative you could install just a

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:33,900
meter package if you are into games

00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:38,570
chess or games cards then you can just

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:42,990
install the corresponding packages and

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:45,179
if you are more into tetris games you

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:48,210
will install games - features teacher

00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:49,830
asleep or if you don't know what you

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:55,740
really want to play I suggest to install

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:58,980
games finest which contains more than

00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,320
hundred games it's a lot now but in my

00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,649
opinion you cannot narrow it down to ten

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:08,460
games which are good because people tend

00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:10,860
to say I like strategy games and the

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,940
others say I like role-playing games and

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,640
there are other ones who like

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:18,679
first-person shooters but those hundred

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,539
games are of high quality I believe and

00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:27,750
some of them should be enjoyable for

00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:31,980
everyone that's all bland homepage at

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:35,880
the moment as you can see it consists

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:39,600
mainly of the game description and two

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:43,110
links to the packaging at records Debian

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,870
org and my opinion this site could also

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:50,220
be improved but as usual we need more

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:55,289
people who are well one to invest time

00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:57,299
into it so we not only needs people will

00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,460
try packaging but it would be nice if

00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,890
there were there more people who would

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:06,990
like to design a new page for example

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:09,750
and I think if it is done well you you

00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,480
can definitely promote foss' games

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:16,740
better but in the meantime I think it's

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,250
solid ok thing and it's informative

00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,250
definitely

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:27,320
yeah well since last year loves a lot of

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,770
happens and we got some new games and

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:34,580
because we had to remove some others for

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:37,820
example gt3 heads was removed and a

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,330
special game which I liked a lot or old

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,200
lights

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:47,960
that's a clone of elite was also removed

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:51,500
because the maintainer couldn't provide

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:56,240
support for an embedded library which is

00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:59,419
called lip most Jas there were security

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,150
implications and upstream didn't want to

00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:04,190
remove the embedded library so he

00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:08,150
decided okay I didn't want to do all the

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:11,200
work and it's enough and well it was

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:13,669
dropped and there are other games like

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,150
the aforementioned detail turret which

00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:21,280
depended on norm two libraries in this

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:23,750
case so we cannot do very much because

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:29,360
nobody is interested in porting them to

00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:30,919
ignore three was we even got a response

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,830
from one of the upstream developers who

00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:38,210
said wow it was cool at you I maintained

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:42,110
my game 15 years for 15 years but

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,580
nowadays well I probably should rewrite

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,940
it and port it to another language

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,100
something like that it's a shame but

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,030
that happens all the time and it would

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:57,520
be cool if we could improve on that but

00:20:52,030 --> 00:21:00,710
well not enough people and another game

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,250
we had to remove from Debian that was a

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:06,890
sprite editor the last game on the list

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:08,960
and the author decided to change the

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:12,590
license to a non free license so there

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:16,210
was not much willingness from our sites

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:19,760
to maintain it anymore on the other hand

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:22,340
we somehow know people packaged new

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,010
games including DD debts which I have

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,860
heard is a popular game and Taiwan and I

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:30,530
believe one Taiwanese a contributor even

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,410
packaged it there are other games like

00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:38,880
ice breaker which were even

00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:42,070
used so this is a good example for for

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,990
not you shouldn't worry too much about

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:47,200
if games get removed you can always

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,990
reintroduce them and icebreaker is such

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,210
an example

00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:56,050
there's also loop yahoo which I can

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,300
recommend loup-garou was formerly known

00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:02,080
as open loup-garou but the name is a bit

00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:05,290
misleading because it wasn't open the

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,680
assets were still not free but this

00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:12,160
changed last year and wolf wire games

00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,220
decided to change the license and so we

00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:22,780
could introduce us introduce it into

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:24,730
domain well it's now I have talked about

00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,670
they remain all the time but they are

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,680
also games today on contrib so why do we

00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,270
ship games in different countries most

00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,790
of these games are game engines which

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:38,410
are free software but they don't have

00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:41,530
any free assets so in order to shift

00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:45,190
them and David main we had to either

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:47,710
create new contents Oh ethical winds

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,280
upstream to change the license nothing

00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:55,630
of that happened

00:22:50,280 --> 00:23:02,080
examples are general queue to openmw and

00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:05,860
mr bean and 4l general and q2 I created

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,920
a new data package so those engines on

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:13,200
those games could be moved to Debian

00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:18,610
main but openmw and M are being are

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:22,470
difficult because they are commercial

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:26,110
games these commercial games are

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:28,840
consisted of I guess several gigabyte of

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:32,470
data and they were never made a free

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:37,780
sort of free so in order to play them

00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:40,860
you have to download them somewhere well

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,860
why are we so picky about

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:50,360
that our game content must be free

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:52,909
there's actually a debate popular men

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,679
was just saw one said since the earthen

00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:56,360
the game is not software it is not

00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,000
ethically imperative to make the art

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:04,580
free though free artists an additional

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:08,149
contribution some in our team disagreed

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:11,600
with this view and said that it is

00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:17,149
imperative that for a game to function

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:20,419
it also has to it requires data software

00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:23,169
images and they must be free so without

00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:26,480
those assets the game wouldn't function

00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:27,679
and that's why we decided to support

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,139
them in their own country

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:34,600
the engines are free you can study the

00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:38,210
code about well the assets are non free

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,970
my opinion we should use encounter as a

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:45,039
staging area and work on it too

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:48,289
well either produce free contents or

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,980
take free content from other sources and

00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:54,830
rearrange it and create create our new

00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:57,470
new packages sometimes a demo version

00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:03,460
would be enough it doesn't have to be

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,460
always a complete game yeah

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,460
then we came up with another solution

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:12,080
better Simon and Aleksandra Simon

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,090
developed a tool which is called the in

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,539
data package room and it is written by

00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:21,200
three which is able to download content

00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:27,529
from different sources mostly good old

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:31,850
games gog.com or you can also use images

00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:36,309
from certain CDs or DVDs and the to just

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:40,940
checks verifies is the data wellit's and

00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:44,090
it creates hash tons of files and they

00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:47,960
are stored in Yahoo files and we have

00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:51,429
currently 215 support games and you can

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:54,710
just easily use a command line tool and

00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:55,429
if you possess if you own the original

00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,830
account

00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:02,890
then it will create a debt package for

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:08,210
you why it's useful most people want to

00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:10,549
have a clean and tidy system and if we

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:14,059
can package it and that'd be an actual

00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:18,230
mod that's definitely more favorable

00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:23,480
favorable than just putting those files

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:27,020
in your home folder so that's quite at

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,370
least non free non free is evil packages

00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,409
must be placed an unfree if they are not

00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,059
compliant with the gfs gene or are

00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:33,169
encumbered by patents or other legal

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:36,860
issues that make the distribution

00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:40,720
problematic the minimum requirement is

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,720
they should at least be distributable

00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:51,409
most non free games essence game data

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:54,260
packages but we also have or heads some

00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:57,760
games like zeng bent sangban i don't

00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:01,870
know how this trans correctly that's

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,370
fork of an bands very popular rope game

00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,980
the only difference between Eggman and

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:09,830
Simon is beside the rules and there are

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:13,190
more characters more possibilities to

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:16,610
play the game is that they kept the

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:19,730
original license which forbids to make

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:23,120
money with the game that means it is not

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:26,120
free so if the author of sang bands

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,090
tried to convince the original author of

00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:32,120
the codes to relicense it like the

00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:35,000
Eggman Fox n band folks did then it

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:41,780
would probably in Maine nowadays but it

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:44,030
didn't and then we also have steam yes I

00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,190
should mention steam of course this is

00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,320
the most popular non free game package

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:52,460
in Debian with more than 5000

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:55,659
installations steam was definitely the

00:27:52,460 --> 00:28:00,789
game changer for Linux I guess it was

00:27:55,659 --> 00:28:04,159
2012 Steve Foley notes and as of today

00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:08,179
according to steam TV info more than

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:13,879
2000 208 commercial games are supported

00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:18,460
only notes so they were natively should

00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:21,320
we care I definitely think so because

00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:24,799
steam is not only the largest digital

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:28,940
distribution platform for PC games but

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:32,389
it also attracts new developers who want

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:35,749
to create new content content that works

00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:38,869
on the notes or they want to make their

00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:42,799
existing games available on Linux simply

00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:44,529
because there's a market and as I don't

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:49,190
know if you know the Humble Bundle

00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:51,470
projects they sell bundles of computer

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:55,210
games and they make it mandatory that

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,210
they should also run on Linux and

00:28:55,509 --> 00:29:03,529
compared to Mac OS users Linux users

00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:06,320
there are less Linux users but they

00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:09,769
spend more money on those games than Mac

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:13,100
OS users do and that was very important

00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:15,830
finding a few years ago and well people

00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:19,159
thought oh if I bought my games really

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:24,080
no so I can make money that's obviously

00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:29,409
a good thing and more people joined join

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,409
the train and it goes it goes forward

00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:36,440
well steam is not the only digital

00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:41,450
platform but it is definitely the most

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:47,480
important one there are other gaming

00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:48,889
platforms for example uterus and which

00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:54,289
is not in Debian but it's free software

00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:58,009
and the goal of uterus is that you have

00:29:54,289 --> 00:30:00,740
a unified interface where you can just

00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:03,230
click on a game and then it is installed

00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:07,129
with all of necessary tools like

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:09,769
emulators or contents and it just works

00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:13,070
or if it is a Windows game it would

00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:18,289
install wine configure the game and

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:21,400
you're good to go as I said it is not in

00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:24,500
Debian yet but it looks promising to me

00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:27,800
but we also have another package which

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,280
is called retroarch it's quite similar

00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:35,780
it is it is also a unified interface and

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:39,620
it focuses on emulators and other media

00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,180
players it's very similar but it's

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,780
already in Debian so you should

00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:47,930
definitely check it out I've sponsored

00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,030
play a tee a few months ago two months

00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:52,600
ago

00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:57,530
that's another project which tries to

00:30:52,600 --> 00:31:02,060
simplify packaging non free games which

00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:03,670
either the drm free or not drm free most

00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:07,070
of these games are from Good Old Games

00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:09,740
or Humble Bundle and the only thing you

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:14,770
have to do is install the package run

00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:17,870
play IT name of the game and then a bill

00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:19,430
mmm oh no what I'm not sure if it will

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:23,050
download on the package automatically

00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:25,700
but if you have the extra file or the

00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,740
executable file you can just type play

00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,570
IT name of the program name of the game

00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,670
and it will create a Debian package for

00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,220
you which is then locally installed on

00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:36,020
the system and you can play the game

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:41,230
which makes very easy for even for

00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:41,230
casual users to to keep this system tidy

00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:46,460
then I should also mention wine and wine

00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:52,940
is not an emulator that's the acronym

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:54,700
and wine made it possible for me in 2008

00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:59,690
that I could play World of Warcraft

00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:02,120
machine which was well I was the only

00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:05,980
one in my online clam who played

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:08,780
dominoes in those times in those days

00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:11,870
nowadays is much more common there's

00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:15,860
also a company which which is called

00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:18,320
cross over and that provides commercial

00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,450
support for wine games so you have your

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,560
Windows game and you can just install it

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:32,110
on your on your normal Linux system and

00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:32,110
run most of the times for example

00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:38,690
the if the game is supported on Mac OS

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,649
like world of work of course it is more

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:45,700
likely that it will also run on on Linux

00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:49,190
that's the experience I have made

00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,899
another good way to to play Windows

00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:53,690
games on Dino's is to use play only

00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:59,960
knobs which is also front-end for wine

00:32:53,690 --> 00:33:02,840
and it is free software but also in

00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,179
Contra because it downloads non free

00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,610
assets and non free stuff so we had to

00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:09,500
put it there but it's a very good

00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:17,899
front-end which makes it also very easy

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:22,909
to install windows games only knows who

00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:27,169
are we the living games team is most

00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:31,669
responsible for its response for most of

00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:35,809
the games in Debian about 400 and we are

00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:37,809
a bunch of guys who try to maintain the

00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:41,659
older games and try to package new ones

00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:44,840
but we are short of manpower windpower

00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:46,870
these days so we can always we would

00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:53,289
always welcome new members

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:53,289
I myself joined the team in 2012 and

00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:59,480
yeah it was quite difficult in these

00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:02,120
days because I couldn't find any

00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:06,080
sponsors nowadays it's built easier

00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,810
because you can just go to Mentos dots

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,010
Debian net and if you're lucky you will

00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:13,190
find someone who can sponsor your

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:19,669
packages but in those days it was harder

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:26,839
definitely harder we are yeah how shall

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:31,820
I put it we try to integrate games and

00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:34,790
you know try to make it better but it's

00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:37,570
very simple so if you don't know if you

00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:41,510
want to contribute something don't think

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:43,669
about how or what should I do you should

00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,480
have a clear motivation so it's not

00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:47,970
enough to just say ok

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:52,530
I'm here and I want you to do something

00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:54,600
that's recite for failure in my opinion

00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,730
you should have a clear opinion of what

00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,540
you want to do you don't have to be a

00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,780
coder you don't have to be someone who

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,480
White's

00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,540
a lot of codes you don't need to be a

00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,730
programmer we also need people who

00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,640
create icons as I said before because

00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:13,890
they improve the visibility of games or

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,130
we need people who write documentation

00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:20,430
we need people who translates

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:23,550
descriptions like I said if you if your

00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:26,760
users can't read the descriptions that's

00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:30,680
already poor experience so we should try

00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:33,210
to translate more game descriptions and

00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:38,490
that would be nice so you don't need to

00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:41,730
be a programmer don't be afraid to do

00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,109
the seemingly lesser work in Debian it's

00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:49,400
important very important in my opinion

00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:49,400
to to make it to make games look good oh

00:35:51,080 --> 00:36:03,060
yeah what else can we do first of all if

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,790
you don't want to contribute on a

00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,340
regular basis or if you if you're afraid

00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:11,130
to do it and just talk about your gaming

00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:14,480
experiences just play the game and tell

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:17,369
people about it

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:23,750
you can also package NuForce games but

00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:28,460
you can also appreciate if you fix a box

00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:34,109
currently the parks our packages and

00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:38,150
well there are a lot of them and even

00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:41,100
more importantly important is report box

00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:44,730
what what I see what I often see is that

00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:47,700
we release a game and then a few months

00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:51,570
after Devon was released some people

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:53,520
report backs which we couldn't we

00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,350
couldn't detect before because those are

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,300
runtime bugs

00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:59,960
it is very hard to find them and

00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,540
yeah we need more people who just

00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:06,720
install a game try it out and tell us if

00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:11,220
it is worked if it works for them I've

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,980
also thought about four new projects one

00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:17,300
of these projects is improving our

00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:19,920
homepage the brand's home page but also

00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:22,710
we could also create a completely new

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,650
page home page at games to be an ark for

00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:28,650
example which would make it more obvious

00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:30,390
that we that we have a game section

00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,970
under Vienna so at the moment it is

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,590
quite hidden under the brands framework

00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:37,050
perhaps we could move it to a more

00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:39,660
prominent place

00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:42,660
I also saw about thought about and the

00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:45,840
game contents database which would be

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:48,720
similar to code search dotnet that is

00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,340
Debian project for obviously for certain

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,890
code but you could also create a

00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:56,430
database for image files or sound files

00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:58,500
and list them all in these stuff and

00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:02,550
these databases and with the license and

00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:05,370
a preview of the image so that people

00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:11,130
could find new images which they then

00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:14,310
could reuse for other projects last but

00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:17,190
not least a life life image about

00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:21,050
lemming games would also be nice people

00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:24,240
tell me we don't need it but I think it

00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:26,490
would improve the usability of our game

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,730
so if you could just hand out some image

00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:31,310
and say hey here are hundreds games

00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:38,640
which we support all right in Debian

00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:43,770
let's try it let's try them oh so far so

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:47,960
good I rushed to all my slides and on

00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,960
other slides do you have any questions

00:38:48,840 --> 00:39:00,690
I have my name is Andres Tila

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:04,980
I want to agree with fuel that blends

00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:07,410
pages not very modern anymore and I

00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,120
would love if somebody would do some

00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:11,700
better design is this all template that

00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,410
you can start today and I bet attack

00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,680
templates we are using it for all planes

00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:19,850
all this exactly yeah others would be

00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,740
profit as well I you might know that

00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:25,380
older strata is for Debian astronomy is

00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,410
some different design but for me it's to

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,610
less information but if you need to

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:35,190
decide another hint is because you said

00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:39,570
you had trouble to find the sponsor in

00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:43,410
2012 and he added in 2013 the effort

00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:47,010
spawns ruin of plans it's just in India

00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:49,710
a page where you can prove that you have

00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:52,560
understand plans concept and if you have

00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:58,590
been spelled the package I try not to

00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:00,810
sponsor a package yeah that's a random

00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:07,200
project and I knew about it

00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:09,090
back in 2012 but I tried directly to to

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,740
quince the team members of living games

00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,020
to to sponsor my packages and I was a

00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,430
bit disappointed well we have a games

00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,590
team and nobody of the games team

00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:19,440
sponsored my packages so I had to rely

00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:23,100
on Debian developers from outside team

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:27,440
to sponsor my packages and when Vinson

00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:29,520
Shang became even developer he was

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,190
merely the only one who sponsored my

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,820
packages then so I had to rely on two

00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,770
people and was disappointing so I just

00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:42,480
remember it nowadays it is definitely

00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:45,090
better but I fear not everyone knows

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,060
that we have a mailing list or that you

00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:51,900
can reach us IRC so if people want to

00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:53,040
contribute they often find difficult to

00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:57,630
find

00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,300
the person we should talk to you and I

00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:01,950
think we could improve that but I don't

00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,390
know how at the moment well that it's

00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:11,460
definitely something something will be

00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:13,980
put to better another question do you

00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,840
have encounter some kind of legal issues

00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:19,380
because just like you mentioned there

00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,560
are many cami engines on that Debian

00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:25,190
package at least but most of them may be

00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:28,920
reverse engineered or imitated found

00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:30,720
found pump iron prior works so is there

00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,780
any kind of legal issues that they were

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,950
trying to sue the distributor because

00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:43,040
you distributed some kind of um pirated

00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:46,320
so yeah I assumed this all cleanroom

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:49,880
developers developments I'm not aware of

00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:55,680
any game engine that has a complete

00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:59,400
ripoff ake a remake of an order game so

00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,710
they tried to create something use

00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,920
something which is similar to the old

00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:08,400
game but also new there's nothing that

00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,700
is exactly like the old engine so for

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,590
example take our general that's a clone

00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,900
of Panzer General which is what it was a

00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:22,290
game from the 90s develop an American

00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:28,260
studio and I'm aware that a Russian

00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:31,170
developer well he almost created a clone

00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,530
of the original engine but it was able

00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:38,040
to sell the new game and still to this

00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:41,880
day he can sell at this game and it

00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,650
looks absolutely similar to the original

00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,580
game but we don't have this problem at

00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:51,570
general is very different and our source

00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:54,770
code is visible to all so as long as

00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:57,510
this is the case and we know the author

00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:59,130
has created it and licensed it on a free

00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:02,000
license I don't see a problem for them

00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:06,859
in but if we are aware of

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,680
Buse or you know wrongdoings we should

00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:11,930
remove yes

00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:14,750
how about it emulators because there are

00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:18,590
PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 you

00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:21,050
bladers and some Eagle issues was some

00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:24,940
Sun lawsuit was filed in the United

00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:28,970
States and if I remember correctly the

00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:31,690
ETS I believed the PlayStation 1 and

00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:35,540
later was was taken down from several

00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:38,210
several sites because the lawsuit back

00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:42,280
then was Sarah Wow and it was illegal to

00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,280
this true those kind of so school I

00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:50,090
don't know I can't say much about that

00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:52,340
no one's so I can only reiterate if we

00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:54,200
are aware of wrongdoings we will remove

00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:57,290
it but at the moment I'm not aware of

00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:04,010
any game engine that is a problem for us

00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:04,640
I was told I can only answer one

00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,400
question

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:27,920
I won't we can we can talk about about

00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:29,420
anything later 2012 and 13 Jeff stuff

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,300
work with Creative Commons in Mozilla

00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:34,400
open gamer to run a contest called the

00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,530
braided pixel Cup and we raised

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,420
something that was just about $13,000

00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:40,369
there I was put up for people with a big

00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:44,119
free game art and free games to go with

00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:45,619
them as a contest and I thought it was a

00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:48,200
really successful project we'd love to

00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:50,810
do it again but we need more partners to

00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:53,720
work with to do it I wonder if you think

00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:56,420
people would be interested in pursuing

00:44:53,720 --> 00:45:00,499
something like that

00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:04,799
we could announce such contests on our

00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:08,069
different media channels we have we are

00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:09,900
we we have a news use side or we could

00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:11,339
announce it I mean you should have you

00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,559
should talk with our publicity team

00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:17,009
about that that's the way forward I

00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:18,930
think you you need to communicate it to

00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:24,210
the community or you should post it to

00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:26,819
planets Debian perhaps we if you posted

00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:30,479
on a mailing list it's probably it

00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:32,279
probably gets lost so I think there

00:45:30,479 --> 00:45:36,479
wouldn't be interested in such contests

00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:39,660
but we must sure that it is well then

00:45:36,479 --> 00:45:41,910
then people get to get to know it or I

00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:44,579
inform correctly if you really just

00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:46,349
released some information probably you

00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:48,299
never knew that there was a contest and

00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:50,549
well quite disappointed because they

00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:54,509
wanted to contribute something but well

00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:56,160
no it I don't know as at the moment it

00:45:54,509 --> 00:45:57,509
would be difficult to think abut the

00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:04,469
publicity team and Debian is the right

00:45:57,509 --> 00:46:06,509
place and to to force that okay well we

00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:08,519
were we're running out of time

00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:10,950
I collect Lee answer on all the

00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:13,170
questions afterwards I would like to

00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,619
thank you for listening and for coming

00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:27,839
here

00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:30,930
see you bye bye one thing Keith Beckett

00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:34,890
Beckett is sitting next to me there's

00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:36,660
another talk about games and steam and I

00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:39,960
can highly recommend it to everyone who

00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:45,589
wants to wants to know more about steam

00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,589
