With git-debrebase the Debian changes to the upstream source are
represented and manipulated as git commits, with one commit
corresponding to one quilt patch.  However, unlike with gbp-pq and
git-dpm, git-debrebase uses just a single git branch.

git-debrebase branches are:

 * directly buildable
 * directly editable with git-commit(1) (whether of Debian files,
   upstream files, or both);
 * directly useable with dgit (without --quilt= option);
 * automatically made fast forwarding when published; and
 * have a history useful for git log, git blame etc.

Unlike with gbp pq, there is no need to switch back and forth between
public and patch queue branches and there is no need to apply and
unapply patches.  Unlike git-dpm, git-debrebase requires no in-tree
metadata.

Uploads of git-debrebase branches done with dgit publish the source both
as:

 1. a git branch which anyone new to Debian can immediately use,
   and which Debian contributors can directly work on;
 2. a perfect `3.0 (quilt)' source package as expected by
   non-git users.
