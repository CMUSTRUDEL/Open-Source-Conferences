	00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,770
hello everybody this is the boss to meet

00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,120
the technical committee

00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:17,090
[Music]

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,060
the technical committee is formed the

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:26,619
currently of eight people four of us are

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:30,829
present here I guess most of you know a

00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:37,550
all of us but this who is mr. David

00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:40,940
Bremner the last him hello Philip

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:43,070
pants some people that we do really

00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,010
really care about but are not here to

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,520
say hello which are Mario Merola Simon

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,710
Simon mcbeatty terrible Nicolini they

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,510
cannot be here the conference I am boon

00:00:51,710 --> 00:01:00,940
at once and the Technical Committee has

00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:04,519
had many many other members in the past

00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:06,430
we thank them all and they I mean there

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,509
have been we will talk a bit about

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:14,299
interesting things say that have

00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:16,549
happened so some may be wondering in

00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,649
fact my main motivation for calling for

00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:22,189
this session and for was inviting my

00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:23,899
colleagues here is is that we want

00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,880
people to get involved to know what the

00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:27,859
technical committees and the world may

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,899
be to join us at some point in the

00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:37,119
future so the Technical Committee is

00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:40,159
outside by by a by the Constitution

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,740
section 6 of the Constitution defines

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,709
what a technical committee is and can

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,259
and cannot do basically the technical

00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:50,689
committee can decide on any matter of

00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,549
technical policy decide analytical

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:55,549
technical matter word developers

00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:57,459
jurisdictions overlap make a decision

00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,859
when asked to do so

00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:03,109
tiebreaking overrule a developer so let

00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:05,119
me say if if a developer is doing

00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:07,789
something we can tell them that's not

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,849
the right thing to that's a a last

00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:15,340
resort measure and just to offer

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,260
if you want to please say say anything

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,909
I'm skipping pudding just interrupt me

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:25,750
now the technicalities also bounded by

00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:30,220
the Constitution a the discussion has to

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:33,040
be public so of course like like many

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:36,250
other Italian teams we do have private

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,950
channels but everything that we do must

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,439
be supported in public discussions and

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,599
decision-making with the technical

00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,700
community doesn't go into details when

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,519
outlining a solution no detail design

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,099
work and the Technical Committee is seen

00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,989
as a last resort so if something doesn't

00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:56,859
work out between people between

00:02:52,989 --> 00:03:01,420
developers the Technical Committee can

00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:05,639
get involved yep we are asked to break

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:08,739
the ties among the available options and

00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:14,680
after after alternative options have

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:18,449
been tried and failed so we can offer

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,669
advice to you to any developer who asks

00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:24,940
that and that's precisely what we're

00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:27,250
currently doing that our well I will get

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,609
to the two bugs we are currently working

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,609
on

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,579
so the Technical Committee is a

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,720
self-nominated

00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:40,510
a board well a group that is the

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,290
Technical Committee asks the DPL to have

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:47,739
members to it it's DPR appointed it's

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:51,760
last resort and it's a body for conflict

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,220
resolution and at first providing so

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,760
what do we do what have we done

00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:01,690
in this last year well most of our

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,829
productivity has been adding adding

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:08,919
members and deciding who is the chair

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:14,919
yeah we do that via a box in the work

00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:16,950
trackers a in the in the past year we

00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:21,090
have had a two

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:22,800
decisions so both decisions are

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,320
repealing all other decisions by the

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,220
Technical Committee because well the

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,530
reality a in different parts of the

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,770
projects has shifted so for example a

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,150
this this first one there was a very

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,300
long thread some of you will remember

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,520
about whether nose could be know named

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,980
note or had to be no to yes because

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,660
there was another thing called no well

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,820
the Technical Committee had decided a

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,440
long time ago that the JavaScript node

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,690
had to be called nodejs

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,400
but now that the other package called

00:04:51,690 --> 00:05:02,390
node is gone they we we repealed that

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:05,610
past decision most of the things well

00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:08,250
the committee is providing points of

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,740
view it's a qualified point of view so

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,620
in this last year we we closed for box

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,440
without a formal resolution it was not

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,170
needed a consensus was found and

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,140
accepted by the developers so we have

00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:27,150
these four box I'm not getting into the

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:29,760
tails currently we have two open box we

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,510
will be discussing both were opened

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:36,210
within the last two weeks and while they

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:39,150
are regarding the the policy sprint that

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:42,240
will is being a spur headed by Sean

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:45,150
Witten we regrettably has say other

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,550
activity at this same time but well a

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,920
we're discussing whether vendor specific

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,220
patch series should be permitted in the

00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,350
house and what should happen when

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,430
maintain your scripts failed to restart

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,600
the service during the package

00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,600
installation or removal

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:08,430
okay well I'm missing there because I'm

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:12,390
at the very bottom but and the Technical

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:15,000
Committee has a limit a time limit of

00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:20,160
three and a half years for provenance in

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,860
it so well Simon and me were the last

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,940
ones to join our term will expire at the

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:30,330
end of 2021 and look from the rest of us

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:34,500
well toll-f is currently the youngest

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,540
one here he's about to to leave the

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:43,290
committee at the end of this year as

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:46,050
well as Didier who's our Past Chair that

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:49,800
the rules for our interest range but

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:52,970
well Andy anyway so every year we want

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,880
to get around one or two new members

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,230
it's not that we need it the

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,750
Constitution states that the committee

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:05,730
can operate with between four and eight

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:08,250
people we are currently eight so but we

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:12,560
want to get new people to enlist to work

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:14,910
with us to volunteer work is not that

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,240
contentious or that hard we did have a

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,520
well before I joined they did have a

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,500
really really hard time deciding the

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,780
neat system you wouldn't want to go over

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,840
it again it's a really really nice way

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,940
to stress test the back tracking system

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,820
it's probably the largest bug in an

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:38,820
entire PDS it's a rather large park yep

00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,890
so well even though the name is

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,950
Technical Committee the work is mostly

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:46,470
social and it's about solving

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,470
disagreements as much of the things were

00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,660
currently discussing at this week that

00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,940
we are talking broadly about technical

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,700
things but more directly about how to

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,580
solve social issues listening to people

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:04,890
sometimes taking some decisions it's

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,270
mostly a political thing and we're

00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,879
looking for people with these qualities

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,949
rights people we

00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,679
empathy technical agility mentorship

00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:16,129
responsiveness social sympathy

00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:19,330
sensitivity and who are cool-headed even

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:22,309
in a world weather like we're having now

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,419
we need more diversity that's that's

00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:27,830
true that's a fact

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:31,009
yeah I am very happy I guess you will

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,829
join the feeling of this that were our

00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:37,269
current cherries Moraga which what

00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:40,940
brings bring some diversity in it were

00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:43,399
mostly male mostly everything a project

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,389
but we need more diversity we want

00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,060
different people say we don't have

00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:53,259
anybody from this part of the world like

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:56,779
that we're looking for people to

00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:58,759
nominate themselves so I thought

00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:01,310
yourself or somebody else if you think

00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,199
about somebody who could make a good

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:10,310
community member please not nominate

00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:12,680
them well we're friendly we are

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,139
available we want to hear you

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,500
we're just people developers just like

00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:22,970
you and of course we want to improve

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,850
processes and well that's that's it for

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:30,939
the presentation on joining the rest of

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,939
day good for for your questions

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,250
these bushes

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,390
on this one

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,879
[Music]

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,559
[Music]

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,100
have you have you ever gone anywhere

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,720
with the roadmap initiative I thought we

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,480
decided that we shouldn't be in the

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,019
roadmap initiative than me yeah that's

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,470
fine yeah

00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,209
I think our opinion was if we wanted to

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,250
be involved in the roadmap initiative

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,880
we'd do it as individuals not as a cab

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:32,490
it not as a committee as anybody else do

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,319
anywhere through the road man I don't

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,319
know okay that's great

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:49,199
personally that strikes me as a bit too

00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,910
top-down but you know everybody can have

00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:56,939
their own opinion that's what I'm not

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:59,009
involved with the road map maybe why I

00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:00,689
mean why are you here why are you why

00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,850
are you in this session what interests

00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:08,240
you to learn from the Technical

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,240
Committee please people

00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:27,550
I think the monkey just care so house

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:31,680
since you don't ask any questions I'm

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,680
going to ask questions of the audience

00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,560
what are the barriers for you to bring

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,790
things to the Technical Committee

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,730
everything is great for you you have no

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,580
conflicts no differences of opinion

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,380
that's great if it's so and please say

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:51,760
so so that the world goes everything is

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,760
great in Debian otherwise I'd like to

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,770
know because there's not too many things

00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,600
coming to us which you know it's ok I'm

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:03,550
lazy so and also I just made a terrible

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:09,790
bug in my C code which I could work on

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:11,920
instead but so please tell me even if

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,650
it's only hypothetical for you so what

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,640
might prevent you from bringing things

00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,640
to the Technical Committee

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,730
am I supposed to answer for everyone or

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:48,810
okay I guess in my personal opinion I

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:50,790
think there's a history of having the

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:56,490
projects go to the Technical Committee

00:12:50,790 --> 00:13:02,100
and either not finding a resolution in a

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:08,400
reasonable amount of time or like the

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:12,089
universe exploding and so I think a lot

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:15,020
of people have are scared of putting

00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:19,170
things forward the Technical Committee I

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:21,690
think this has changed we've liked for

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,120
instance to travel emits and everything

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:30,020
so that's like a lot of new blood coming

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,020
in regularly but yeah I don't know if

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:39,540
like we have a lot of inertia in the way

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:42,980
we see things in the project so maybe it

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,980
will change with time I hope

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,619
think we're all pretty committed to

00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:56,649
dealing with issues quickly if we can if

00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:59,470
there's any way of doing that so if it's

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:03,029
if you if you imagine that it's going to

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:06,850
be nine months of aggravation or silence

00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:10,779
that probably won't happen we might say

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,819
I have a tendency to say to people that

00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,439
I don't think that both justify is going

00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:16,209
to the Technical Committee because I

00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:20,109
think that can quite often be said very

00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:21,819
quickly indeed and still leaving an

00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:24,609
opening for them to come back and say no

00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,649
really because there are some bugs which

00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:29,079
will clearly Eliza

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,519
lay dormant forever or get closed and

00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:32,169
you might as well close them straight

00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,279
away that's the only reason I do it

00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:42,369
if if people think I'm wrong then please

00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:43,769
just try again so you shouldn't I've

00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:46,269
done that a few times recently

00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:49,869
don't take that is we're just trying to

00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:51,249
throw them away some bugs haven't been

00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:54,119
ready for the technical committee when

00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:54,119
they were submitted

00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,279
I think one of the things that people

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:04,610
don't use enough is the advice capacity

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,140
of the Technical Committee we always use

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:11,120
the Technical Committee as like the

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:18,940
Supreme Court of the Debian project yeah

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:21,740
I I think the I constitutional

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:24,980
requirements that people go for what to

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,480
ask the committee for advice instead of

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,089
the committee just coming from the top

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,560
and saying hey we think that maybe you

00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:36,260
shouldn't do things like it like that

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:40,040
could be relaxed a bit I don't know if

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:46,400
it's a sensible thing to do maybe maybe

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:49,970
maybe not since I joined we have had a

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,500
quite low activity in fact at least

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,570
three monthly meetings have been

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,910
canceled because we didn't have any bugs

00:15:53,570 --> 00:16:01,250
open which is good which is good a bit

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:02,810
boring but it's good but say we have

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,980
happened I think it's a good resolution

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:10,490
after all one Bob asking us to review

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:13,220
the weather with it was right to do the

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,870
change of the system of course and

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,150
that's asking the technical committee

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:20,450
for every solution our solution is no

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:23,510
that's not our job so but but I think

00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:25,070
it's okay to just come to this body and

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,260
ask well whatever

00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,720
Erick's you with their project probably

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,120
we will I mean look into it deeply if

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,910
it's within what we have to do probably

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,280
we will not but and we're currently

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,040
answering two questions regarding policy

00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,080
well in the same way the policy

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,010
maintainer say hey what's your opinion

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:49,190
on this so they can have a backing to do

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:51,560
a policy change they actually haven't

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,390
asked for advice they've delegated the

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,779
decision to us which is like the

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,779
difference

00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:03,330
you're both correct there's two bugs and

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:15,150
one of you is correct about each of them

00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:19,760
okay so um I think one thing that I hope

00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:23,730
can change is that people feel like

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,940
having a bug forwarded to the Technical

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,290
Committee if you're the maintainer and

00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,480
somebody disagrees with you and forwards

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:34,040
about to the Technical Committee people

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:41,310
see that as a very negative thing and I

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:43,500
think we should think about why there

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:47,880
certainly are aspects that are negative

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,640
and we should try and change those and

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,650
we should also make sure that the

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,760
perception isn't worse than the reality

00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:59,310
so because it's a bit unfortunate if

00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,920
it's a way to get people to orphan their

00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,540
packages by filing bugs with the

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,740
Technical Committee right that's the

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:10,230
systems not working well at that point

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,850
collectively I mean so part of it you

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,340
know is the way that things have

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:19,550
happened as liquid I mentioned in the

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:21,770
past and part of it is you know

00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:26,760
interpersonal things in the project are

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:28,290
always a bit tricky right but I don't

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
know if there's things that we can do as

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:34,580
a committee yet we talked about being

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:38,340
timely and maybe talking to people early

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:41,790
in the process I mean we've had various

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:47,400
sort of informal consultations about

00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:49,620
conflict issues which is sort of on the

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:55,500
edge of our formal role but I think it's

00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:57,600
helpful and if we're really you know

00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,990
have to get into lawyer ring about it we

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:05,670
can say we're doing it as individual

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:07,539
developers right I mean but I mean

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,269
conflicts don't get easier to solve

00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:12,639
as they developed right people's

00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:17,049
positions become hardened and they

00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:17,619
become angrier and less rational I know

00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:25,080
I do

00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:27,700
so the question anything to shut me up

00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,729
no in fact not David you mentioned that

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:35,350
people might often packages as a result

00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:38,559
of a decision of the of the TC so as the

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,419
7th and in general are you as a TC

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,159
following up after your decision what

00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:45,309
happens after a decision has been taken

00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,769
by you and published how this how

00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,049
discontinuous and what the consequences

00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:53,139
of the decision that that you have

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:54,549
published so so what I said actually so

00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:59,559
we'll come to your question is saying

00:19:54,549 --> 00:20:05,799
but to clarify people orphan the

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:07,179
packages sometimes because not because

00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,549
of a decision the Technical Committee

00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:11,470
makes but because someone asks the

00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:15,340
technical committee to make a decision

00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:18,879
they just find the process sufficiently

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:21,609
daunting so it's hard to make a decision

00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:24,009
that will make them happy and in that

00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:25,899
situation but I guess maybe somebody

00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:29,249
else won't censor the your real question

00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:29,249
which was do we follow up

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:41,420
or maybe not so I mean we do right I I

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:45,230
mean and but it is also in a sense up to

00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,910
the project as a whole to say okay or I

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,940
mean usually if you bring something to

00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:52,720
the Technical Committee and there's two

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,040
parties and one of them gets their way

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,850
typically right I mean over

00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:03,680
simplistically but and that one is going

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:06,110
to be interested in whether this

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,230
decision is implemented or not and can

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,240
bring the lack of implementation to that

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,920
to the attention of the committee if it

00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,550
doesn't happen so I think there's sort

00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,810
of a built-in I don't know maybe other

00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,550
people there mean there's subtleties

00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,860
that I'm missing here but of all the

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,510
things that we might be screwing up I

00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,590
think that that's probably not one of

00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:30,200
them I I haven't really seen a big need

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,030
for it like in a formal formal way

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,360
because partly because of that and

00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:38,180
partly because if the TC decides

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,220
something then maintain errs don't

00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:44,330
actually go around undermining that by

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,340
failing to implement stuff I think if

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:53,450
they did then we would have other

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:56,150
problems so yeah I normally get

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,400
interested in the the actual problem

00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,930
while we're looking into it and so I

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,140
quite often carry on looking at it

00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:06,680
afterwards so in a very informal way I

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:13,160
sort of follow up but I haven't made a

00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:14,690
point of it so if decisions we're about

00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,960
things that I'm really not interested in

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:21,430
then I probably wouldn't notice if they

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,430
became toxic afterwards I don't know

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,060
I think well I am happy and that's one

00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:29,710
of the points I pointed out in the

00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,390
presentation which I must say it's

00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:35,070
basically a copy from what did they're

00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:37,060
present that last year I am happy that

00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:40,720
most of the things that have been

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:44,980
decided were not a formal decision but I

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,980
was helping reach consensus so if both

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,690
parties in an argument say okay this is

00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,700
no longer a problem because we have to

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:57,340
do spoken door well we don't have to

00:22:51,700 --> 00:23:01,540
follow through because it's gone I have

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:04,900
something from IOC Harewood has made a

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:09,070
comment about why people are reluctant

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,870
to actually put thing forwards to the

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,400
committee

00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:15,400
he's saying that his experience twice

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,050
that he has built an issue for what to a

00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,890
committee and by the time it was

00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:24,850
resolved the issue was obsolete how long

00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:27,730
ago was that I don't know I mean I know

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,590
I know that was a problem or at least a

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:32,110
perception problem I don't know with a

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:35,680
committee long time ago I think it was

00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:40,540
mr. new year ago but I don't recall

00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,520
exactly I think if we will get back to

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:46,480
you with the answer hey I think it's a

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:49,390
fair comment it will always be something

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,810
we need to watch to make sure that the

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,940
committee is or to to try to make the

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,040
committee as responsive as possible I

00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,790
mean as you know everything in Debian

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,860
happens according to people fitting it

00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:06,310
around all their various

00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:10,450
responsibilities but generally people

00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:13,120
who join the committee join it knowing

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:16,750
that for some periods of time they will

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,830
have to try to really make an effort to

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:21,910
be responsive to give any stuff so has

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,220
Frodo it was more

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,850
when your ago maybe it's got better

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,800
maybe I mean I think it's a we're part

00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,920
of Debian right so we run on Debian time

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,230
just like the rest of the project and

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:39,220
but it it's also true that it's a

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:42,220
time-sensitive thing so I think if you

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,650
reporter an issue that's caused by

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,500
someone doing something just as we go

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:50,290
into one of the harder' freezes it

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,210
freezes tester for a release then the

00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:54,550
Technical Committee in the past has

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:57,460
certainly not been responsive enough to

00:24:54,550 --> 00:25:02,100
do something useful before the release

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:04,330
happened so I guess we just need to

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,730
notice that that's exactly what's going

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:11,500
if that happens again we'll have to make

00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:13,720
some sort of precipitates we've only got

00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,570
two days to decide this type of decision

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,850
it's better to make a decision than now

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:21,670
than to make the right decision later

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:24,610
and just deal with it straight away

00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,950
because there's certainly been more than

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,890
one issue in the past where that

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,300
situation has occurred and just by you

00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,580
know someone's a faithfully one their

00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:37,210
case by default because there wasn't

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:41,740
time to deal with it so yeah it's it's

00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:44,860
not crazy for submitters to explain the

00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:47,890
time aspects of their request when they

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:50,650
make it also help us understand what the

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,080
issues are yeah that's quite often

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,150
people assume that we're going to

00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,340
instantly see their side of the argument

00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:00,970
and there's no need to explain it really

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,050
and if you do that then we all go what

00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,170
is this thing that they're talking about

00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:08,080
and it takes ages so if you have a a

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,750
good argument set it out and possibly

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,840
point out the other side of the argument

00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,040
a bit as well and make sure that there's

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,040
clarity about what the issue really is

00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,780
and then that is an introduction to the

00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,240
other side to make a decent argument

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:24,760
back if it's just this person's rubbish

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,610
and you need to tell them to stop doing

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,480
that it's much more difficult to do

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:33,160
anything useful

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:36,040
short time head which has been saying

00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:39,070
that he agrees with you now so yeah what

00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:42,490
you said makes a lot of sense I have

00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:45,100
another question from IOC which is about

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:47,070
one of the cases that just arrived in

00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,200
your inbox what do you think about

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:55,960
allowing fan no specific matter series

00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:57,790
in a sauce package I think I've made my

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,950
position pretty clear that I think it's

00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,950
a really bad idea to about in devil I

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:10,600
haven't completely formed an opinion yet

00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:14,380
but I'm leaning towards that I don't see

00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:18,010
a good argument in favor of these patch

00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:20,410
series I mean I or rather I haven't

00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:26,620
found the arguments presented so far to

00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:28,900
be convincing my my initial reaction to

00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:33,429
it was that seems like a great place to

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:36,059
hide malware and it would need a pretty

00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:38,650
strong argument to keep them given that

00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:42,340
because I haven't really noticed them

00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:46,470
previous to this so someone needs to

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:49,210
come up with that argument I suppose and

00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:52,360
laying with the positions they presented

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:57,280
and their wealth I should say nobody has

00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:59,500
spoken for for the vendor-specific patch

00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:03,280
series so far besides the person that

00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:07,690
was that brought up the topic so I mean

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:10,059
I cannot say state I cannot foresee what

00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,740
we will end up deciding but I don't see

00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:13,630
this will be a very contentious argument

00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:18,250
we're basically waiting for other people

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:20,679
to talk and I guess that within within

00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,780
this say one month period we have

00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:28,050
between a

00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,050
IRC meetings I hope it would be closed

00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,920
what's the question

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,770
also about the other case or was he

00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,990
sterling the question about no need

00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:41,440
Ducky's yeah as far as I can tell at

00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:43,900
least I'm really interested in feedback

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,880
from developers in general on the onion

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,360
squids thing scripts thing because that

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,400
seems quite subtle to me so if you know

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:58,240
a lot about init scripts please read

00:28:51,400 --> 00:29:00,370
this bug and he educated me for for

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,440
those who haven't read the bug it's

00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,660
basically should what what should

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,120
maintainer scripts do when restarting a

00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:13,750
demon fails should they tell or should I

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:16,240
continue I mean yeah there's no clear

00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,970
position but but we didn't do have the

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:25,270
problem of a as there is no clear answer

00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:28,660
we have a predictable outcomes sorry I'm

00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:32,340
I'm I'm asking about a Christian I I

00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:36,310
just want to EXA Capel how do you make

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:40,620
consensus because I think the most

00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:45,060
violent argument I remember now is this

00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:50,680
up story and the system T arguing that

00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:51,780
end up that we have enough to vote which

00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,830
one is the best

00:29:51,780 --> 00:30:03,600
maybe not the best which one has done

00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:07,630
most of all and so so in in general it

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:11,260
had to be discussed and me it says no

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:16,720
more cast of you in the country of agree

00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:20,800
understand one something our for this is

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:25,480
simply easy it's the kind of really

00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:27,129
chromecast that that we have to watch to

00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,039
make sure that this

00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:32,039
that is that no room for discussion

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,859
and yielding the magnaphone because i

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,340
wasn't part of india i wasn't there

00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:43,229
either

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,159
i did watch quite a lot of the

00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:50,309
discussion i think mostly people

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:52,289
submitted quite detailed descriptions of

00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:54,809
why they thought what they thought and

00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:57,149
fried persuade one another and in that

00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:59,580
particular instance people were not

00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:02,549
persuaded so it came down to a vote but

00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:04,769
the way we more often do things is that

00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:06,840
we don't normally have to go into so

00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:08,999
much detail because it's easier to come

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,700
you know if everybody agrees at the

00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:17,879
start you don't even we don't even vote

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:19,139
normally no we we do eh yeah I I think

00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:22,289
there have been instances where we don't

00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:23,909
have them voted yeah because it was

00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:28,289
completely obvious that everybody agreed

00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:30,509
with doing a particular thing but so if

00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:34,590
there's some sort of split then people

00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:36,929
start justifying their positions and the

00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:39,379
more that happens sometimes people

00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:43,409
change their opinions and then the

00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:45,749
disagreement evaporates yeah in general

00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:46,440
you try to to make the disagreement

00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:49,649
disappear

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:54,029
by understanding why the other person

00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:56,399
holds their position and and in some

00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:58,440
cases it's generally because you have

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,389
but the world looks different from

00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,049
different places but quite often it's

00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:08,029
just because you know it it's fairly

00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:11,039
easy to align on on evolve you which is

00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:12,960
this is the set of trade-offs and this

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,259
makes more sense to do it that way it in

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,259
that way

00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:23,980
I was thinking well of course people

00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:26,559
would bring this this topic of the

00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:30,820
system decision and we'll probably keep

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:33,040
bringing it up in future years but the

00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:36,010
thing is I'm thinking of it as something

00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,980
more broad I mean no I don't remember

00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:42,250
such a discussion or backlash when

00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:45,549
RedHat to the same decision or when well

00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:48,130
many other distributions did may a maybe

00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:51,400
what happens is that we do have an open

00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:53,980
decision process people everybody wants

00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,290
to be part of such a relevant decision

00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:00,429
that changed the world a Linux landscape

00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:02,080
for good but the thing is I mean the

00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:06,090
same decision was taking in so many

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,710
places that say we were recently asked

00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,080
whether we should review that of course

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:14,799
we unanimously said no we don't want to

00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:17,710
review that but I think hundreds of

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:24,730
other distributions are are okay with

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:27,610
with the path taken I think the the

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:30,100
premise for the asking us to review it

00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:32,049
was completely broken is is the reason

00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,880
why when when there was a disagreement

00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:36,070
in the Technical Committee it was

00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:40,299
between whether that we should switch to

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:43,240
an upstart or to systemd it wasn't

00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:50,380
whether we should stay with being it or

00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:52,450
I mean open Rd was a long third so at

00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,370
this point I think it's you know with

00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,230
the benefit of hindsight I think it's

00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:59,080
pretty clear that upstart wasn't gonna

00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:03,100
be a great choice because where's

00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:05,559
upstart it could event I mean it got

00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,929
killed off by upstream basically when we

00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:11,980
decided to switch to yeah but also you

00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:16,179
know upstarts had severe problems for

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:17,970
quite a time and the original developer

00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,909
I don't have to talk about yes we don't

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:22,039
we don't

00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,690
that's the reason why is the question

00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:25,879
was wrong when it was presented to us

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,760
again because the question was asking it

00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:30,710
as if as if going back to Sisyphean it

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,740
was an option and it wasn't an option

00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:35,149
even then that wasn't on the table so it

00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:40,549
was between two choices one of which

00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:43,309
isn't there anymore hope not see was was

00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:46,669
way behind there wasn't it really are

00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:49,419
there any more questions I shouldn't

00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:52,069
have started that it's okay it's systemd

00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:54,349
I think the real problem actually is

00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:56,179
that people think that they are you know

00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:57,500
that Debian is there's everybody in

00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,450
Debian thinks that they mean is theirs

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,579
so that's why people didn't complain in

00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,230
Red Hat because red hats just you know

00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:05,839
like milk or something it's something

00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,410
they buy and that's not a bad that's

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,730
great

00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,349
no that's really good but that's why

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,559
people get upset you know you don't get

00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:14,809
upset about the person that manufactures

00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:19,490
your tires changing the ingredients or

00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:20,900
something do you still want opinions in

00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,670
the peanut gallery on what should happen

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,579
moon when main scripts fell to be sort

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,710
of service yeah I do okay I guess like

00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:29,660
so probably like obviously it's like the

00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,250
reason this isn't fun as many in the

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,660
reason that you know nobody can really

00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,950
decide what which way to go is because

00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,059
like it is sort of a Tolan

00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,069
implementation-specific

00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:38,180
like rather it is gonna be deployment

00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:40,099
specific leave me some cases where you

00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,880
absolutely do care and you want to fail

00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:42,740
and that's gonna be something you're

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,720
gonna notice and then be able to take

00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:48,140
action on in other cases you could you

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,900
know give two shits but um i think that

00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,950
said for the default i i suspect the

00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,250
answer should be it should cause a

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,430
failure

00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:57,710
um just thinking from the context of i

00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,059
am setting something up and see i'm

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,260
sending something up via like chef or

00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:02,599
whatever and i say install this package

00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,299
and expect to be configured one chef

00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,099
unsuccessfully maybe you say i should

00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:09,589
add up like a check that after after

00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:10,640
reinstall this package we know then do

00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:11,960
some health check to make sure it was

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:18,609
both installed incorrectly configured

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:21,710
but i think it'd be less surprising if

00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:23,150
like that install failed because the

00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,819
ended result of the service of money

00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,150
didn't occur and then this sort of goes

00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:29,610
back to billions

00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,690
either said like you know on by default

00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:33,950
if you install something it should be

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:36,690
running and we request me but that's not

00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:38,250
okay for every deployment so we already

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,810
provide mechanisms for you to say in

00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,430
when installing packages no service

00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,930
service but and I think that in the same

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,150
way it would be reasonable to offer

00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:50,460
tunable but I think the default should

00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:53,940
be to fail actually since it was a

00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:58,200
cogent self Union yeah it made sense

00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:00,780
i I'm not yeah so without saying yes we

00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,260
agreed let's decide it looks way but no

00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:06,260
thanks for the the cogently expressed

00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,260
position

00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:17,900
anybody else have similar differing

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:17,900
opinions this would have ten minutes

00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,550
I'm gonna check out your si

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,370
it's not that we have to squeeze every

00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,400
last minute of this of the session if

00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,360
there's no more questions welders

00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,620
perfectly was time to have more some

00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:56,890
more coffee say thanks to everyone for

00:37:53,620 --> 00:38:00,090
coming and also to people were watching

00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:02,350
the stream and on IRC and hi homeland

00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,000
and we're looking forward to your

00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,280
nominations for the tech committee of

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,730
course yes please think about it yep we

00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,390
are short on candidates we want you or

00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:16,510
would want you to nominate your friends

00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:18,520
or enemies not really nominating your

00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:22,720
friends is great because if you've got

00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:25,150
if you're in some little nook of Debian

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,340
where most people have never heard of

00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,200
what you do even and you know that

00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,630
there's one person that is really good

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,970
at solving arguments between the rest of

00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,410
you guys then nominate them because

00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:41,860
that's the sort of person we need one

00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:45,310
and they will broaden the diversity of

00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:47,950
the committee probably because they're

00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,780
not from the usual suspects of people

00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:53,080
that keep on turning up to DEFCON four

00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:56,110
and all that so if you're doing some

00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,840
strange little bit of something which

00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:01,300
nobody's ever heard of and there's some

00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:06,880
very wise person that you can point out

00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:09,910
then nominate them in in terms of how

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,930
much time it takes it's not very much we

00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:16,570
say that we ask people to reserve like

00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:20,380
an hour a week in practice I find it

00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:24,600
it's less so it's in terms of actual

00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,600
workload it's not that much

00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,100
okay I suggest everybody leaves now

00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,719
