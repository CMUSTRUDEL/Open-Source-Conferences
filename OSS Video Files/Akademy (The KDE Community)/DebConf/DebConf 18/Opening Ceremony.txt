00:14:39,300 --> 00:15:01,440
phone hello seems to be there's a

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,870
problem with the food that there is no

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,350
food is enough to everybody and the food

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,620
isn't it before they time is scheduled

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:12,390
how do you two think about that maybe we

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,980
have to eat less or something like that

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:22,470
I know it's for vegan food sometimes you

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:25,470
run out so if you are not vegan food you

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:28,010

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:38,460
