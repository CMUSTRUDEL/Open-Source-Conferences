This in mainly about

1. packaging XMPP software (clients, servers, libraries) both within the XMPP team (https://salsa.debian.org/xmpp-team/) and elsewhere.

2. the XMPP infrastructure of Debian itself (prosody on vogler.d.o).

Everybody interested in one or the other topic is invited.

okay then let's start um I made a wiki

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,410
page these days for this Boff

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:35,710
and let's look what the questions are

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:40,930
okay um first thing we had to knock off

00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:43,930
last year at napkin from Omaha it was

00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:46,629
trust by accident because I were hoodie

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,030
which said XMPP and then people

00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:52,390
approached me I knew involved into

00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,659
something with XMPP and I said well not

00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:58,210
so much but okay there was some

00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:05,649
interested in boffin quite a lot of

00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:10,660
people came and there were some some

00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:15,460
ideas for can be made better an XMPP

00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:17,470
related packages in debian and also we

00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:21,670
talked about the infrastructure of the

00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:25,390
ABN itself our own XMPP server okay I

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,580
try to summarize a little bit about what

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,780
I know what happened since last year and

00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:36,790
I probably do not know everything so

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:41,890
trust tell me what I do not know what

00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:45,430
happened there were made releases of for

00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:48,759
example the XMPP server prosody from 0 9

00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,430
to 0 10 and this is already in Debian

00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:57,820
and already also and stable back ports

00:01:51,430 --> 00:02:00,729
so whoever likes to run prosody you can

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:05,740
have the latest and greatest version on

00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:11,150
both pasta and stretch III body has also

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,900
been updated major release 218

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:18,170
[Music]

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:21,780
it was so awesome a drug release and

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:25,200
also there was a major release of of the

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,560
client Gatlin which is quite important

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,590
release because it does now use Python 3

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,489
instead of Python 2 3 TK 3 instead of 2

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,590
TK 2 and all this stuff so very

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,250
important for the future of entreaty k2

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:47,930
and Python 2 will get removed at some

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:53,099
time also pick a dress like macabre and

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:55,140
profanity have been upgraded I think

00:02:53,099 --> 00:03:00,060
both of them didn't make it into the

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:03,000
stretch release because of box and also

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,030
there's a completely new client called

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,980
Dino in Debian and I know I am because

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,610
there was a different program Dino

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:16,859
before long ago but it's still Debian is

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:20,819
a eternal database if a packet exists at

00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:22,889
one point in time it is very difficult

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,380
to ever have a different ticket for the

00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:29,160
same name it happened but then you need

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:33,870
a long time until it's gone from all the

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,690
old old old old archives and so on ok

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,859
what also happened is there is now an

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:45,049
XMPP team thanks to salsa

00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:49,200
there is the XMPP team on Salazar and

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:52,440
most known most not but many XMPP

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,410
related packet rests are now in the XMPP

00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:00,599
team prosody Katrin Dino

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:06,900
C+ profanity macabre and a lot of other

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:09,829
stuff so whoever does some packet ring

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:14,639
work inside of them bein related to XMPP

00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:18,450
think about moving your packet to the

00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,290
team so more people can help fixing bugs

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:25,040
and you can

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:28,290
help the others okay that's what I know

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,560
anybody else who knows anything about

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:36,060
any progress of anybody or not progress

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:41,870
of any packages since last year or

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,870
whatever okay

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:55,159
and that point I'd like to know who of

00:04:47,060 --> 00:05:02,990
you uses XMPP as as and user so for

00:04:55,159 --> 00:05:06,650
petting for example so most which

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,620
clients are your preferred clients both

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,440
on debian and also not on Darien let's

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:20,870
say on a mobile phone or wherever you

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:26,810
use it maybe we can okay you didn't use

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:32,870
XMPP right you are you which blind are

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:43,060
you using no the for the XMPP I know

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:43,060
okay no no okay okay mm-hmm well

00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:05,590
thank you mm-hmm on iOS yes yeah okay

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,440
okay I agree

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:16,810
okay let's add its end and then I repeat

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:22,960
what kitchen on laptops use pigeon or

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:30,460
profanity cell phones conversations okay

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:37,889
so I try to summarize most use pigeon

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:42,250
garum wand I know and on on phones etc

00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:47,100
and conversations and on iPhone tragic

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:51,010
you okay

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:55,750
and next question would be is there

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:59,340
anything in the context of Debian which

00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:05,590
should be done regarding the client side

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:08,860
so it's is there anything missing or any

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:14,349
ideas we can improve not from upstream

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:17,490
but from Debian I know that all example

00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:21,750
peak lines are horrible but this is a

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,750
thing of the upstream developers

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,660
I would say Dino is a big step

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,360
you know for usability for usability

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:39,220
that's true unfortunately

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:45,750
Dino has very very few contributors and

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:50,680
I see one comment per week or less so it

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:53,020
does not improve so fast attitude

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:58,080
I hope it gets better because yeah it's

00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:04,960
really nice looking but feature wise

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:09,610
that's far behind all the others untuck

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,400
Noatak friends and family yeah yeah yes

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:17,099
absolutely for non-technical people it's

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:23,560
really nice it looks like conversations

00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:29,550
only on um on the PC server vice who of

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:31,320
you does Fran and XMPP server and and

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:38,159
are you using

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:44,140
Debian packages or prosody or etravel

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:46,120
eachother d good choice prosody and I

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:50,650
didn't realize there was a back part of

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,110
upstream so yeah yeah you can run 0.10

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:57,610
yeah so as I do I actually switched to

00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:01,000
backwards yeah yeah it's a huge progress

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:03,310
from 0 9 to 0 to 10 so you should use

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,860
spec pause thank you I'm also running

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:09,370
prosody also the back part yeah the -

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:13,240
yeah I'm also running prosody back paw

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:16,950
the back parts and my company's or more

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,930
less internal server for the company and

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:23,220
dannion also runs proceed evil thoughts

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:27,399
I on this huge progress since last year

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:31,660
Fogler debian or is our server for RTC

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,370
and XMPP voice over IP has been upgraded

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,370
to stretch

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:41,410
and uses now prosody back ports and

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:45,420
prosody modules back ports so still many

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:49,690
people say 'i gravity is still better so

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:52,720
probably it is I and in fact I think

00:09:49,690 --> 00:10:01,900
about ranging from prosody to enjoy any

00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:06,339
of my company okay is there anything

00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:10,589
about the server stuff it's only three

00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:18,460
people who could command well you should

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:21,520
do something better a stallion I think

00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:24,700
if we manage to have always the latest

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:30,790
or best version packaged in the same way

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:33,850
yes so we can do I think currently this

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:37,270
is a case so what what I see from

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:40,589
prosody Trivedi and also from at least

00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:44,230
some of the clients it looks it looks

00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:45,480
like the best distribution could do even

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,080
back thoughts to the stable version

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,900
still I

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,900
I get always questions about gut rim for

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:57,150
for classy and people want the latest

00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:01,300
catch them on older Ubuntu versions or

00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:04,650
all the mint versions and that's not so

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,660
much I can do as it any a maintainer I

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:10,870
almost do not have any contact to Boone

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:14,380
to and less so two minutes I do not even

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,690
know how to how to work with the people

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,510
it's more thing how old

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:26,200
Debian works with down strains and so on

00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:28,690
and nothing related to XMPP okay now

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,279
there be an infrastructure who of you

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:35,890
uses the Debian XMPP server which is

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:38,259
anyway elemental two weeks to Debian

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:42,100
developers

00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,899
Danis no probably not Debian maintain us

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:48,549
do not have an idea or address right

00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:51,839
it's all they can't use okay so who is a

00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:55,989
Debian developer and uses XMPP service

00:11:51,839 --> 00:12:02,009
at least once in a while you have your

00:11:55,989 --> 00:12:06,639
own I'm using it last year there was

00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:09,789
many complaints about spam it was and it

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,220
was really really horrible and everybody

00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:17,289
in the room who used the service of

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:23,979
Damien said I get 10 20 messages every

00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:28,689
day in Russian or sometimes combined

00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:32,769
Russian English that was really horrible

00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:35,499
it dropped significantly we plan to

00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:37,379
stretch in fact to use a firewall that

00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:41,229
we never been able to install a firewall

00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:43,869
it still dropped so we are I asked

00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:45,879
around why I had dropped and some

00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:48,970
theories about it but nobody knows

00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:53,139
exactly by a draw it might be that the

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:56,109
spammers found out that XMPP is dead

00:12:53,139 --> 00:13:01,809
technology and it isn't worth two cents

00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:06,579
spent XMPP uses I don't know

00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:10,059
also there was as XMPP spam fighting

00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:12,579
manifest did you hear about it if you

00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:16,779
search for it on the internet it's by

00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:23,970
one of the exam pp gurus the one who

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:29,819
does the android jackson client gieok

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:33,419
something and he wrote a manifest how

00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:38,439
administrators of XMPP service should

00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:41,589
prevent spammers for example limiting

00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:44,140
the number of accounts you can create

00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:49,400
per second

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:52,820
and other things maybe some admins

00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:57,650
really implemented ideas of him I don't

00:13:52,820 --> 00:14:01,370
know anybody knows about this issue and

00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:07,850
why it dropped or maybe it does not drop

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:10,460
in Genoa I never got to spend oh so I

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,360
don't know if lucky you awareness comes

00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:16,580
from or yeah I got so much spam on all

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,620
daily anarchic addresses last year and

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:22,550
there were a lot of people who said I

00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:25,280
never want again use my example I used

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,290
the Debian or God rest for some time

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,470
yeah then I switched off I switched it

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:36,380
now on but no I

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:39,170
I think the spam comes mostly when when

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:44,450
you travel use ID is an email address

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:47,080
that is published somewhere so they just

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:52,060
looking for email addresses my private

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:55,550
job ID is also my email address so it's

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:59,390
circulating around anyway and they

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,430
specifically I think try to spam

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,190
anything that looks like an email

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,760
address or looks like a charity which

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:12,260
has the same syntax so that's mostly

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:16,910
likely why the TV Norg Java I t's also

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:19,339
cuts so much spam yeah yeah but that

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:22,220
would be the same for me with the Debian

00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:24,710
address email address equals Chapel

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,910
address so this is rather strange that

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:31,210
some developers got all that stuff and I

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:35,740
was for some reasons glued

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:39,760
yeah now it dropped totally I get maybe

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:42,520
one to invitation spends per week which

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,670
is okay I just ignore them

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,450
so not direct messages anymore but

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:53,380
contact requests that ask them anyway

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:57,070
because I see that the center is nobody

00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:00,850
I would know and and also the the

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:03,580
message is neutral so it's not oh we met

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,010
at that conf let's have a contact know

00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:10,690
it's always yeah the user which is to

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:14,620
contact you okay go away or normally I

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:17,860
like if people requesting contact if

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,290
they write one or two personal words so

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,110
that I know okay this might be someone I

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:29,380
would like to have contact let's talk

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:33,310
about box number something okay oh you

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:37,590
are lazy maintainer then I know okay the

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:40,990
person really knows me okay

00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:43,570
that's mainly what what I noted in the

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:47,160
wiki so there's not so many things to

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:54,700
drop this year much less and last year

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:59,490
good well any anybody likes to address

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,490
anything related to XMPP and all dannion

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:07,450
yeah so I'm not using XMPP at all at the

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:11,080
moment I dunno IRC I'm using IRC

00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:13,330
sometime and maybe you could quickly

00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:17,040
explain the difference between IRC and

00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,040
XMPP yeah

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:27,800
and even innocent I think the the most

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:33,560
interesting I'm not an expert but for me

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:37,010
it looks like they managed not to to use

00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,770
this Oh MIMO which works like like the

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:44,830
signal it's more or less a complete

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,830
implementation of this protocol and this

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:54,050
improves on a lot of drawbacks which I

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:58,610
also saw for the of the record messaging

00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:01,250
and yeah exactly executor the device

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,960
must not be available when you send the

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:08,570
message should not need a bouncer

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:12,890
no oh and so this I think on well

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:16,480
conversations is pretty good in that so

00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:19,940
I had no problem so far there are

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:25,810
especially for conversations and the

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,810
other not of in other implication other

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,790
clients don't have this implemented yet

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,420
gotcha is the other one for desktop

00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:38,810
which is most advanced yes a but I know

00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:47,840
is it or is it already available yeah

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:50,330
provoking what's good for me okay I'm

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,400
the maintain off ball and I'm maintainer

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,940
of both Ketchum and I know and I always

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,950
test me more if I by using the two

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:03,440
clients okay with my own accounts I

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:06,800
never tested it myself but from time to

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,580
time I follow the conversation the group

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,890
chat mmm but I discuss about clients and

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:18,670
stuff and this is sometimes interesting

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:18,670
and they were kind of suspicious about

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:26,070
the status of Dino but I think this is

00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:31,410
really a which makes it kind of there is

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:33,390
missing a client for iOS which really

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:36,390
it's better than unsecured yeah which

00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:40,050
works flawlessly all or jet secure must

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:42,960
be improved but if you I use it with my

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:46,650
my family my brothers and their families

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,020
and my parents and of course this is

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:52,380
mostly on the same server but it really

00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:56,540
works pretty well so it's really I would

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:59,340
almost say competitive competitive -

00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:02,429
what is the name what's up what's up

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:08,429
right yeah

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:10,830
I use XMPP also as my girlfriend I

00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:14,370
forced her to and she would not use it

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:16,920
otherwise but yeah she uses

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:20,940
conversations on Android and she sends

00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,770
me photos of our cats and I'm not here

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:31,470
it's okay yeah that's like what's up

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:33,570
yeah there is not a dedicated client

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:39,540
with the right user interface flags lack

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:42,480
the technology would allow it but yeah

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:48,480
this is a big problem as XMPP all

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:51,690
clients are problematic but if someone

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,100
would write a select like client it yeah

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,340
it would be possible based on the

00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:03,000
technology I have to say both IRC and

00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:11,760
XMPP are very old I think is C is now 26

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:14,250
years old or more 99 yeah it's now 19 20

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,190
years old and I see is even 6 7 years

00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:21,780
older so both are very old what you get

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:23,250
with XMPP is an ID you login into the

00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:27,510
server with your ID and your password

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:30,610
and that's you and with with is see

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:33,799
there are nicknames

00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:39,440
then there's Nick serve as a workaround

00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:43,660
but yeah is C is different than

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:48,309
disrespect so for example that in theory

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:52,100
spam fighting is easy with XMPP because

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:54,470
you have a verified ID it's not like

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:59,840
email for example I cannot send you an

00:21:54,470 --> 00:22:03,020
XMPP message with a faked sender it's

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:07,220
it's only if I'm the admin of the server

00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:10,660
but then it would be possible but not

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:15,169
and if it's me ma encrypted and nestle

00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:18,110
so it's it's it's even better than email

00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:30,620
in this respect while IRC is worse and

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:34,940
email in fiscal Specter I would say yes

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:39,590
yes yes this is what the prasada spam

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:43,730
filter module can do you can you can

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,290
block complete servers you can block IDs

00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,150
which does not make sense

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:52,460
for spammers because a train ride is all

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:54,559
of the time but for example what is

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,250
really nice in XMPP you have the roster

00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:01,190
so a contact list and spam filter can

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:05,000
easily say okay everything that is by a

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:07,010
contact is whitelisted which makes it

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,690
possible to be a little a little bit

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,850
more aggressive than the rest of the

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,919
spam filtering with email that's it's

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:16,370
not possible because you never know

00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:18,320
whether the sender is real and even if

00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,990
you say yeah this Center is right list

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,030
that it doesn't make sense it was XMPP

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,030
it's possible you can whitelist me and

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:33,040
I'm not an expert on XMPP neither I'm a

00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,040
packet from obviously and

00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:48,550
only if you are the admin of a server

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:52,640
because the server address is verified

00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:55,270
by the receiving server so if if you I

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,720
don't know what your server name is

00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:04,730
something dot 80 and my server receives

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:09,260
this then it looks SS from something dot

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,580
80 and then yeah then it can be fake

00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,440
because you have the admin of your

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:19,670
server but only the widths of yeah of

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:23,350
yourself so as far as I know I'm not an

00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:26,510
expert on that but that's what I heard

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:36,430
so it's a little bit better verified and

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:42,020
email and much better than IRC DNS

00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:43,250
probably reverse DNS yeah I I don't

00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,800
believe that

00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:48,110
senator Murphy because then it would

00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,600
make things more complicated because I'm

00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:53,090
left to implement a trust mechanism

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:57,140
before and that does not exist to my

00:24:53,090 --> 00:25:01,430
knowledge and I think it works that you

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:05,450
usually you allow your XMPP server only

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:09,870
to federate with with other servers

00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:13,710
which have a certificate SSL certificate

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:15,690
and that's and and this is common you

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,840
know the XMPP well that but it's not

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:22,800
common in the in the email world because

00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:26,070
you always have to be be able to if

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,770
someone even if an email server doesn't

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:31,800
have a certificate you have to you need

00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:33,420
to accept mail from the server so they'd

00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,700
from the beginning they more or less

00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:40,590
decided that we that they all want to

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:42,960
have or demand this SSL connection and a

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:49,230
certificate and so there is it's more

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:53,100
effort to get into that system and in

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:58,140
fact when Google still had significant

00:25:53,100 --> 00:26:00,090
XMPP usage I had to still whitelist the

00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:05,130
Google server because they did not use

00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:07,920
SSL but because I do not know anybody

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:10,340
who still uses XMPP with Google and I'm

00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,770
not even sure whether it works anymore I

00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,780
know they turned it off I I remove long

00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,780
ago the whitelist entry for Google

00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:21,240
anyway so I allow only SSL server

00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,000
connections and in fact only SSL client

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,090
connections as well wants to use my

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,460
server without SSL has trust deadlock I

00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:34,380
do not care

00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:37,290
I probably everybody has configured

00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:41,480
their server that my writers it's very

00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:45,290
common in XMPP know that SSL as a must

00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:49,470
anybody else one yeah

00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:52,440
so I said VP can be a slack alternative

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,110
but the XMPP technology in itself has

00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,780
been used to develop a lot of

00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:00,080
messaging plants the most famous ones

00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:04,730
are is what's up you could still find

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:08,660
the messages or emails of the founders

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,640
of what's up on the XMPP mailing list if

00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,790
you would search for a few years back

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,710
you would still find there also

00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:20,179
conversations and there's this con talk

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:23,000
is also rather XMPP messaging plant so

00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:25,010
contact you want with Kentucky booth

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,570
fielding is just like signal or what's

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:33,559
up but one day we a friend of mine and I

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:36,260
actually did conversations to contact

00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:39,460
chat and yes and it worked

00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,840
con talk uses for numbers yes

00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,880
conversations is usually the XMPP

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,520
conviction that we do but we still

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,559
managed to get send messages with both

00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,150
of them we just needed to figure out if

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,770
I'm giving the phone number what is the

00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:55,040
user name and pass us what it is

00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:57,910
creating on the server so things that

00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:02,419
could be developed yeah

00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:05,480
one thing that is funny and I was at the

00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:09,620
mini Def Con for Hamburg and there was a

00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:14,840
sprint by a number of people they liked

00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:17,660
to bring move him to Debian it's for

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:21,370
admin PHP so I could really not help at

00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:26,770
all because I do not know any PHP and

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:29,720
yeah but movem is a XMPP client that

00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:32,960
runs on the web but as a server so you

00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:37,450
need to trust it for example it and

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,450
password so best you run it your own

00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:43,070
but if that web interface and it's more

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,309
like a social network so it is a little

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:50,049
bit like whatever Facebook or or

00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:53,299
whatever social network so it has group

00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:55,250
it has groups and you can follow other

00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:59,840
people and you can also trend and group

00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:02,230
fit but it's all based on P XMPP and you

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,820
can combine it with all other

00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:09,520
peak lines and so on and they even have

00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,430
funny features from the social network

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,390
world for example if you ever heard from

00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:20,020
younger people maybe the world stickers

00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:23,050
and stickers are like little images you

00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:26,710
can send around and a movie you have

00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:29,380
even stickers so you click there and

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:32,770
then you have a number of cats and

00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:37,210
penguins and so on and princesses and

00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:40,360
everything and when you send it and it's

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:44,560
also this sticker implementation is

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:49,000
based on the XMPP standard so it mainly

00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:51,130
sends the half of the speaker image to

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,250
the client the client looks whether it

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,440
already knows this hat and when they

00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:00,190
trust show the trolls right sticker and

00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,950
if it does not yet know the hash then it

00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:08,500
requests the sticker from the other side

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:10,960
and so it's like so it's quite different

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,870
from sending photos because of photos

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,740
they are probably unique so it doesn't

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:21,130
make sense to have a hash mechanism but

00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,290
stickers are sent again and again so it

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,860
makes a lot of sense to to case them so

00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:30,670
they have this other mechanism and XMPP

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:32,560
but so far only very few except pp

00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:35,140
client sticks Apple stickers in fact I

00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,270
don't know any other than know him so

00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:42,010
let's hope that movie also gets into

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:44,850
Debian unfortunately I do not know the

00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,850
state of affairs

00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:52,890
so what was nice at the mini debconf in

00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,800
Hamburg that was even the uptrend

00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:58,260
developer movem it's mainly one person

00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:02,070
or one and a half but the complete one

00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:04,320
person he was at mini debconf it was

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:08,010
very nice yeah I believe he is not even

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,470
a Debian user but he came specifically

00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:17,040
for the sprint to the Deaf conflict I

00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:20,040
found really nice there's another social

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:24,900
network based on XMPP

00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:27,570
it's called sandwich one and it's

00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,210
already in Debian is now a new version

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:33,060
upcoming and I hope we get it also into

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:35,730
Debian but some dependencies we have to

00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:39,870
track and so on so don't hold your

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:42,630
breath again like all good software it's

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:49,620
made by a single person who does it in

00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:51,260
his spare time after work so both

00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,600
movements are you at wha

00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:57,780
goofing movem and sandwich are to social

00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,520
networks both based on XMPP and there

00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,670
and a lot of things completely

00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:06,170
compatible so user of cellular power can

00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:11,240
send messages and I do a lot of stuff

00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:11,240
with Morrie Musa so this is really nice

00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:19,410
let's hope both will be in Debian by

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,250
Busta okay

00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,250
that's from my side

00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:35,100
the Dino

00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:38,430
I am package is linking to the Dino

00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:41,820
package in the tracker and I forgot the

00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:43,140
iron you have your account of the V key

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,710
Daniel hasn't it

00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:50,670
okay yeah the Dino was a music program

00:32:46,710 --> 00:33:00,510
or something right yeah MIDI MIDI track

00:32:50,670 --> 00:33:02,780
um yeah trust fixative key okay anything

00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,780
else

00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:13,100
so let's see what we have

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:23,180
what updates on this thing's we have

00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:26,900
next year in Curitiba we have a definite

00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:30,110
that maybe you know this is a good

00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:34,670
question that's something else but that

00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:39,380
you reminds me on the on the Debian XMPP

00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:42,560
server so far there is one room but only

00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:47,240
for the admins so there are typically

00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:49,700
only Victor and Victor and Victor and

00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:55,310
maybe you sometimes me and maybe Daniel

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:59,300
Pocock but we could create more routes

00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:01,610
and we can also think about allowing at

00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:04,550
least Debian developers to create rooms

00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,230
and then other people who are not Indian

00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:10,280
developers can draw in the rooms of

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:12,820
course that would be a nice addition we

00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,820
just have to enable it in the

00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:18,710
configuration yeah at least Debian

00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:22,580
developers should be able to create

00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:27,650
rooms on the other hand Debian uses

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:30,050
mainly IRC and if we start to use XMPP

00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:35,120
for rooms it would exclude

00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:37,970
the users of IRC which I would find not

00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:43,040
so nice on the other hand if use IRC

00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:48,040
it's easy for exampie P users to join I

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:52,090
to turn IRC channels because our our

00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:54,950
gateways I use P Bhoomi for example so

00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:59,120
we can activate this feature of a/c

00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:03,310
rooms but it would be nice if it if you

00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:06,830
do not forget please about the ISE users

00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:09,410
we have pages where we list all the

00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,960
Debbie gnosis channels yeah vehicle

00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,839
similar

00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:17,220
with page four listen all that Debian

00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:19,829
xmpp rooms in regarding missing out on

00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,140
conversations we are between the two is

00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:26,220
your exit we could create bridges yeah

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:28,140
okay so is like not for the bill but for

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:32,400
a lot of other communities that I'm in

00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:35,579
we have bridges for IRC matrix and

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,410
telegram aqua and people can choose to

00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:40,140
join from anywhere and they still get

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,059
messages this is correct so something

00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,720
good there's something between XMPP and

00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:49,050
as it could be easily done yeah there's

00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,420
one bridge the event is in Canyon and

00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:56,369
which was very nice it's called be boo

00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:59,309
me and does anybody use me all about it

00:35:56,369 --> 00:36:02,819
people me as mainly a break from an XMPP

00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:05,220
server to IRC so for example I drawing

00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:09,630
IRC channels by means of people means so

00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:12,329
I use my company XMPP server or another

00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,220
one that features people me the Debian

00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:16,500
or cassava does not yet have people mean

00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,369
sorry I cannot use that address and then

00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:23,910
I go in IRC channels and works

00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:28,290
relatively well relatively sometimes

00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:35,819
whisper it's okay and some people even

00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:39,450
preferred over direct IRC so I I can

00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:42,000
talk to - Daniel and Victor also

00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:44,549
maintaining the the Debian servers that

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,420
we install and activate people me on the

00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:55,760
Debian or Java and you can use your XMPP

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,760
yo address to draw an IRC

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,270
okay

00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:11,630
but

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:11,630
I'm hungry let's go to lunch 15 minutes

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:27,600
in Europe it's lunchtime now I was

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,030
trying to recreate any kinds of wheels

00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:33,060
in rust and maybe if anyone have

00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:36,450
something else idea of a xmpp L maybe

00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:40,410
I'll try to with an outsider writer SMPP

00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:46,350
library rust okay it's already 1:00 yes

00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:48,120
I think morph French guy well when XMPP

00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:53,640
when I say something it's always a

00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:54,390
French guy it's very good French xmpp RS

00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,790
it's called

00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:00,060
do you know this yeah Kolya but I don't

00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:02,190
know but check his github pages it's

00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,530
like they only have support while only

00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,630
well flairs then well only one for these

00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,790
tenders as the others are still in the

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:12,270
wish list so maybe I should contribute

00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:16,080
lip first just said some poor requests

00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:18,900
or something else yeah maybe you can

00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,930
talk to him directly he's always on XMPP

00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,660
and as far as I know he currently does

00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:27,440
not have a drop deliberately he quit the

00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:31,800
drop to have more time for free software

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:36,240
as far as I heard and to blame or the

00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,340
violin I think it was oh maybe older and

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,190
at first contact him and I think he

00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:44,610
laughs any contribution so he's very

00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:47,160
nice person and I think any contribution

00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:51,600
is very welcome or any cooperation or

00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:54,540
whatever and because yeah there's still

00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:57,590
no real good rust software for XMPP and

00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:02,210
it's something that is really needed

00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:04,520
if you know contact to him me her or him

00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:09,830
yeah

00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:15,440
next ya later he's an arc Linux user but

00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:17,780
he was at last step confer Molly on this

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,990
better means because I didn't I didn't

00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:25,340
even contribute any kind of package for

00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:29,870
any kind in the institution now it's

00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:33,640
very nice so it's fun to work with in my

00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:37,990
belief also he knows a lot about XMPP so

00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:40,990
this is very nice I sometimes ask him

00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,990
stuff

00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:53,089
