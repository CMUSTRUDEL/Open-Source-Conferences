where'd he go and he's the debian

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:36,110
project leader the guy in charge of the

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,110
whole thing okay thank you

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,600
good afternoon lovely to see everyone

00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,230

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,060
lovely to see so many people here again

00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:57,210
of course can only start with greetings

00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:58,980
from a hot and humid Taiwan well thank

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,360
you very much for inviting me and for

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:07,830
their local organization team perhaps

00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,079
that can be done on the microphone yes

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,560
very much a hot and humid Taiwan I mean

00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,249
on that subject I was recovering after

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,899
my second shower of the day in my room

00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:22,469
sort of half falling asleep here in sort

00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:25,950
of sort of afternoon haze and I am was

00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:31,829
suddenly awoken by a like a bird stuck

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:33,780
somewhere or maybe on a balcony and it

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,789
was quite insistent you know about a

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,490
half a minute later heard the same bird

00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:40,079
you know what's going on and I realized

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,819
it was it seems to be coming from the

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,520
wall just behind me so maybe there's

00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:47,429
sort of panels and pipes coming through

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,479
the wall and there's a bird's get just

00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:50,700
got stuck in there I've heard it

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,520
happened before so I'm cool on the

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,200
concierge telephone saying this seems to

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,780
be seems to be a bird stuck in the wall

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,139
you know it's making these so loud

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,060
sounds what can you can you see what's

00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:06,749
going on short certainly sir and send

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,240
someone up wait about five minutes doze

00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:11,069
off again and the bird kicks I forget

00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,120
and no would have come up so a ring back

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,269
terribly sorry

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,060
tarah guards just have the bird cease to

00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:19,000
be here

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,709
yeah Oh did no one come up no okay we'll

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,740
send someone up straightaway no problem

00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:27,819
again sort of fall off in the in the

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,920
humidity and wake up again in the woken

00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:33,340
up by the bird again what what what's

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,260
going on like hi yeah really sorry to

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,580
disturb you but the bird seems to be

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,110
there and it actually seems to be quite

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,090
distressed I mean I don't think he can

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,140
get out and things like that I'm really

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,010
sorry about this sir I know what

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:48,370
happened we sent someone up I don't

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,300
I'll come up myself right away wait a

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,220
few more minutes

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:56,890
again just hacking away or something and

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,080
still no one comments no and I'm just

00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,720
thinking what okay what's really going

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,120
on here so caught for the final time I

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,459
okay I'm just I'm gonna go back to the

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,569
venue now but yeah no one's come up I

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:12,489
don't know what's going on you got the

00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:14,500
right room number and I'm sorry sir just

00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:18,420
for a second just checking you do know

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,420
that our doorbell chimes a birdsong

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,210
[Laughter]

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,890
there you go there you go anyway

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:38,110
greetings from lovely to see you so many

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:40,650
people here great so I mean every time I

00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:44,230
stand up here or I'm around Debian

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:48,090
developers I get this question so what's

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,560
it like being DPL it's almost sort of a

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,959
almost a clean head question I'm never

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,160
really sure how to how to answer it

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,650
really I mean because obviously people

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,329
are when people ask these questions

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,130
they're sometimes looking for an answer

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:03,640
or maybe I don't want to put them off

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,109
running themselves but it's very

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,180
difficult to answer because it's not

00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:12,040
really a position that has any parallel

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,780
in any other free software project I

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,670
think I mean you can I can just make

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,220
jokes all day about it I mean Debian

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,560
project leader what outsiders think I do

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,539
I mean if you speak to other people they

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,550
think oh it's just me you know decree

00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:26,380
that I think yeah we're going to use

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,120
this thing over here and you're going to

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,050
do this

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,850
you're going to do this and what are the

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,770
Debbie developers think I do everyone

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,930
thinks I travel the world like some sort

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,930
of itinerant something-or-other

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:52,680
what my parents think I do yes--very is

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:56,610
true other distributions think I do or

00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:02,040
let's think what we do anyway yeah what

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:05,610
I think I do and I'm the boss the head

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,070
honcho but what I really do is read and

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:12,180
read and read a lot of email and things

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:13,889
like that yeah so yeah means always like

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,389
in a day and I can also deflect the

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:18,630
question with humor which I've done here

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:21,780
and referenced self-referential II so I

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,340
can get away with it as well so what is

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,699
the deep here what is the project leader

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,039
I mean is it a dictator no I mean in our

00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:32,880
Constitution we say explicitly state

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:36,150
that you you can't you know obliged to

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,310
do anything undertake any task so you're

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,740
told to not that that would even need to

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,810
be written because I told you to go and

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,190
do something you would evaluate on your

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,229
own merits whether you would end up

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,599
doing that so it's not a dictator and

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:50,070
it's it doesn't have the final the votes

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,380
on technical matters and things like

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,940
this which is quite confusing to

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,039
outsiders sometimes and they like well

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,660
what so what do you really do and it

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,930
certainly isn't a benevolent dictator

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,370
for life like in say the Python circle

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,060
things like that it's certainly not for

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,830
life thank goodness but yeah look

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,349
sometimes it feels like it no I'm joking

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,510
country is it a secretary I mean we

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:14,789
course we have a project secretary but

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,410
sometimes it's like a receptionist in a

00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:19,260
way you know people come in and they

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,700
sort of expect they come to the project

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,979
and they expect someone to be sort of

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,349
sort of on on the front desk as it were

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:27,360
and to be sort of you know all in plenty

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:29,729
with that person or maybe I'll them if

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,530
you need to speak to that person or I'm

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:33,090
not really sure who to contact and they

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,099
don't perhaps know the exact name of the

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,570
team to contact is that ah you want the

00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:39,400
cloud team are because they were looking

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,470
for something

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,020
is it a figurehead well sort of but

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:48,680
again as it doesn't as the project

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,480
leader doesn't direct in a technical

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,090
sense it's not it can't really sort of

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,160
forge ahead in on that kind of angle it

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,290
can't say right we're putting all our

00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,880
money behind a parma let's go guys

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,890
that's not how it that's not really how

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,750
it works it's not really a that kind of

00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,250
need us into battle kind of thing so

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,930
it's a sort of mixture of lots of

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:11,210
different things all at once yeah yeah

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,680
it's very interesting which means it's

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,330
very difficult to judge one's own

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,520
success and things like that so what's

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,950
it like being deep here how those kind

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,870
of questions are quite subjective like

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,150
what kind of how do you feel you're

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,110
doing at it or these kind of questions

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:30,560
are often too difficult to answer so

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:33,170
yeah to put some stats on the email

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,140
volume this is current of about 15

00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:39,470
minutes ago in since my last bits on the

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:43,790
DPL in Montreal on the leader inbox this

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:45,470
is not counting spam I the spam just

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,690
disappears he just can't even be

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:51,470
bothered with that 5,000 emails coming

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:56,390
in which I probably read them all how

00:07:51,470 --> 00:08:03,070
many was I sent 1300 and yeah this is a

00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:03,070
up to date so that one more time please

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:14,960
calculate the odds of getting a reply

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:22,760
there yeah dependent it depends who you

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:24,920
are it depends to you if a joke needs

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,340
explaining it's not funny right it's

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,340
something like that

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:38,820
we'll wait for the microphones to come

00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:40,110
around next okay so um so what's

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,720
actually been happening in the project

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,760
since last time I stood up and board you

00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,980
for now so this is from August the 7th

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,180
which was the last bits from the DPL in

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,220
in on floor so I mean let's go through

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,050
some stats so how many bugs this is

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,130
again current about 15 minutes ago I

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,630
couldn't get the JavaScript to be live

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,330
but it could have been it could have

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:07,160
been so 32,000 bugs file which isn't too

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:11,760
bad some of them might even close by now

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:18,000
and you can see that anyone on the high

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:25,200
school here anyone else knew I managed

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,850
to yeah so nobody I think doc who is

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,650
here right yeah you got to take credit

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:34,650
for some of those brilliant we've had

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:38,640
40,000 uploads too unstable which is

00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:41,430
probably what I would guess we've got a

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:46,050
little high scoring table here I don't

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:48,030
seem to have snuck into this one 715 on

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:52,860
maintain rock loads I'm not really sure

00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:56,880
what I would have guessed for that high

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,980
it's our question no cool high score

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,110
table for that again I sneaked in there

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,930
that wasn't deliberate but I I think I

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:07,800
just snuck in a couple of days ago on on

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:10,640
the top 10 we've had quarter of a

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,630
million built according to wanna build

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,330
again that sort of happens behind our

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,100
back so that's kind of fine and 10,000

00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,630
Auto packaged test runs hopefully we'll

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,740
have more of these in the next year

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:24,480
that'd be kind of good great quote stats

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,940
are sawdust in the mouth to read it so

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,400
link what's where actually you can count

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,950
numbers all day and compare this year to

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,180
last year and really nice graphs but was

00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,100
actually sort of been happening in a

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,750
meaningful sense in the project so

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,110
perhaps simply go through month by month

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,740
so in August we had a

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:45,950
big bumper policy release encapsulating

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,329
a whole bunch of stuff that had been so

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,860
fallen through the cracks or been

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:50,839
waiting around I'd like to thank Sean

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,970
for pushing forward with that getting

00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,730
policy out and I think it became a didi

00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:00,519
around this time as well I think so yeah

00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:03,589
we had a sprint to deprecate alley off I

00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:06,440
think was that in Hamburg I think so

00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:08,750
yeah and we also doubled the number of

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,690
outreach interns that we just sponsoring

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:15,050
this year so that represents a dramatic

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,940
increase in the number and things like

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,010
that

00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:22,490
September we I've related the outreach

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:25,240
team somehow duplicated the doubling of

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:28,610
the outreach interns get double through

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,640
October saw the race of nine point two

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:35,810
point release a bug crossing party in

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:38,540
Austria and also Debian signed the free

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,250
software foundation Europe's public

00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,170
money public code and we also had a

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,269
cloud sprint which I believe was in

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,370
Washington in the Microsoft offices it's

00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:49,399
not right

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:51,290
somewhere yeah just yeah when went quite

00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,779
well I believe and a really nice

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:57,320
write-up was sent to the announcement

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:59,959
list November saw two mini dev comps I

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,320
put a prize out for anyone who managed

00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:06,649
to attend both and we finally started

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,660
disabling some old protocols so the FTP

00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:13,339
protocol at least on security on

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,380
security master is now disabled Vietnam

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,779
also moved from their contributor

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,410
license agreement to the certificate of

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,940
origin which was blocking on us sort of

00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,360
moving us also to its and things like

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,940
that

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,459
and there was a new FTP team delegation

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:33,130
to mirror new members and all the

00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:35,899
members becoming alumni of that team

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,040
December saw comp at level 11 which I

00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,100
know you all waiting for

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,000
I know I was it was a great Christmas

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:46,490
present for me and Debian 9.3 another

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,730
just another good stable release no

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,430
problems there January saw the lovely

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,380
specter meltdown

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,820
are happening which was which still

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,190
seems to be happening I hear there's a

00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,920
new one yesterday net net something net

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:03,460
Spectre was it me not named after net

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,910
BST but we'll see we'll see free spectre

00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,790
soon yeah so I mean we've all been

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:13,209
dealing with that to some degree since

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:15,750
then February kicked off google Summer

00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:19,750
of Code and we had a huge number of

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:22,300
applicants and and really interesting

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,690
project proposals and a really good

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,550
turnout for people willing to be the

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,570
word leaked all of them the mentors off

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,570
the team which I thought I was always

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:34,810
really good secretary appointment we

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,820
also had at least three sprints and

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,160
things like that throughout the month

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,800
some of those were attached to falls

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,020
down which was again another big Debbie

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,600
meetup in general and free software

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:50,850
meetup in general which is really good

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:53,320
March saw more delegations sort windows

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,410
Debbie come to windows subsystem for

00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,330
Linux I'm not sure if anyone's managed

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,240
to give that a go yet but it's and puts

00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,350
us at least on parity with at least a

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,920
Bunter and things like that on that

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,620
platform

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,150
we have bugs watching parties in Albania

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,220
and hurry t-bo

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,630
and while the point release always

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,450
pretty good and of course the most

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,339
important thing that month was the

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:21,580
general resolution about the DPL title

00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:23,820
which I'm sure excuse me one more time

00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,820
please

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,020
no this was the DPL title Oh Joan got no

00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,780
seconds but it was to rename the

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:35,000
official title of the DPL of the the

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,690
official way of speaking to them as your

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,460
majesty

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,260
it did not receive any seconds

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,470
unfortunately but um it's there on the

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:45,440
curiosa list

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:48,920
April's saw a secure boots print another

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,890
great report sent and there's some work

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,310
ongoing this this week I believe I'm on

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,870
secure boot a box coaching party in

00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,540
Bratislava

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:01,940
may sort a huge turnout in mini dev from

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,270
Hamburg which is amazing it's a really

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,850
really good really good event and really

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,980
important to that happening next year

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:12,860
Debian was invited to join the kdeeny

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,630
advisory board that matches up with our

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,880
membership on the gnome advisory board

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,760
and this is quite a small select group

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,830
of stakeholders that use the depth of

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,800
the operating system and they try and

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,360
and the desktop environments say we

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,740
think if this is what we did over the

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,120
past year this is what we're thinking of

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,390
doing this is school direction we're

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,880
sort of going in of course there isn't a

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,650
top-down leadership thing going on there

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,240
but it's like how about you know does

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,370
this work for any of you guys this is

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,990
does any of your engineering resources

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,090
want to go into that particular area or

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:48,500
this particular area how can we sort of

00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:50,180
connect and just stay just just sort of

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,680
stay on the same page and in terms of

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,630
like the visions for the project and

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,000
things like that so that's really good

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,850
they also saw the introduction of water

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,160
package tests testing migration of

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,780
packages from unstable for testing which

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,540
i think is really good and really

00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,660
promotes their use it's pretty good and

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:12,530
read allegation of that publicity team

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:15,400
June saw the instruction of the G DGP dr

00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:18,620
I can get in the acronym wrong team the

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,410
European Union data protection and

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,060
privacy legislation which is all you

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,800
know fascinating keeps me up at night I

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,740
know that but very important for the

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,720
project and thank you very much for all

00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,580
those who helped set that up and are

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,630
running that because it's pretty

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,360
thankless job there

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,250
like that and we'll the the number of

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,290
requests will probably only ramp up and

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:44,460
things like that and it's all sis and

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:47,160
Jun also saw the the death in the noble

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,610
Death Valley off long live long live the

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,140
king

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:54,380
it's slow SSH terminals over everyone's

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,190
on sale turnout and I'm really enjoying

00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,840
more on that later

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,240
but I'm really enjoying the

00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,430
collaboration that I'm seeing now there

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,840
are on southsun things like that and

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,610
there's also a bug swatting party in New

00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,699
York which was apparently quite well

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:12,630
attended and got a lot of stuff done

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:14,250
July um features in the package tracker

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,730
another point release and of course

00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:20,069
we're now in DEFCON pay team so yeah

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:23,850
that's sort of the year in in words

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:26,010
things like that so moving on a little

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,110
bit what are the future plans what's

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,900
coming up for Debian in the next year or

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:35,070
so the first most important thing is

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:38,430
Debian's 25th birthday we were born on

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,850
August 16th 1993 so we'll be celebrating

00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:45,660
our 25th birthday next month so there

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:49,020
are some plans afoot but get your cake

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:52,140
recipes ready birthday cake recipes

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,910
whatever local events perhaps start

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,620
playing them now because you know it'd

00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,860
be good to have a little little birthday

00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,960
party January we'll see are the first

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,110
the released from the schedule the

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,450
release team schedule the first of three

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,030
freezes that make part of a Debian

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,730
release first the transition freeze in

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:15,030
January then the soft freeze in February

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:18,540
the hard freeze in March justit easy and

00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,760
then around mid 2019 we're gonna the

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,340
release of Debian Buster which will be

00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,390
great and very very much looking forward

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:30,870
to that I'm sure you all are as well

00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:33,270
July will see another amazing Def Con in

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:36,150
Brazil I'm seeing all of t-shirts

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:39,930
already advertising the event and hope

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:42,480
to see many of you there and late 2020

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,850
early 22 one will probably see bookworm

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,210
judging by

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,820
the date if you add up the out of the

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,100
months that's the kind of thing we're

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:55,520
roughly looking at at this point you

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,200
said that so yeah how will we get there

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,360
how will we get to a good Buster how

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,770
will we get to a good book worm what

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,140
kind of things do you need to keep on

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,550
our radar and things like that so what

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,250
does debian need to keep on doing what

00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,780
does debbie need to what would you call

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,760
it double down on what do mean yeah

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,320
things like that what we doing well that

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,060
we should continue Peter to be doing I

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,940
think the first thing we should do is

00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,260
stick to our guiding principles so these

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,110
are things that have served us well in

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:24,050
the past throughout a massively changing

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:25,280
environment go back 25 years the free

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,400
software environment was obviously

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,330
clearly different I was just born

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,970
cough things like that and what served

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,280
us well has got us here and will

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,840
continue to keep us where we are in the

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,200
free software ecosystem in other words

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,790
this linchpin this reliable base so yeah

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,770
things like that I mean it's a bit of a

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,860
bit of a cliche perhaps it's the

00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:51,050
Godwin's law of the Debian mailing list

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,670
to say our priorities are our users and

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,800
our free software and this can be used

00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,690
to justify almost anything you know or

00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,110
like you just want that so we must give

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:02,210
it to them no but if we if we stick to

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,010
this guiding principle I think this all

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,530
serve us perhaps for another 25 years

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,690
and particularly on on the angle of free

00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,520
software AIDS 3 if we start to

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,470
compromise on that if we like we like

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,050
well we know we'll we'll just put this

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,650
thing in here and we'll compromise on

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:21,020
that area I think it'll really wast it

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,840
might have some short-term benefits in

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,940
the long term being keeping to our

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,820
strengths on free software and and

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,230
software freedom will really stand us in

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,160
good stead for in the next twenty five

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,670
years and and we should go even further

00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,070
on that

00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,890
so we should start to look at the

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,330
contraband on three areas try to start

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,780
to look at firmware and things like that

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:47,180
and just see whether they they are

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:49,690
really part of what makes Debian Debian

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,690
and things like that

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,260
which should also continue to cultivate

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,260
technical excellence

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,790
so I mean technical being good

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,710
technically being a great technical

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:04,670
distribution that people can rely on is

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:06,890
our best defense against any I'm gonna

00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:09,730
say competitors but you know what I mean

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,870
but anyone trying to eat our lunch won't

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,090
really be able to because it just can't

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,070
compete technically it's well it's it's

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,320
Debian you know or did you go with we

00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:21,380
went with Debian okay yeah you know she

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,330
was going to keep that kind of thing in

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,060
it's so difficult to criticize any

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,350
decision that sort of made on a

00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,490
technical basis like what why did you go

00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,930
with this technology over this

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,410
technology it's not because it was

00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:37,460
funded by X or funded by Y but it's just

00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:39,620
the better technology okay moving on you

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,170
know there's nothing I think really to

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:45,320
discuss there so if we continue to do

00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,300
that and maintain our great technical

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,030
base and you know releasing when it's

00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,350
ready within reason but not just sort of

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,980
getting things out the door because they

00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:57,440
match a calendar or they match the expen

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,870
expediency of what we've promised or we

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,000
always said may but it's not ready you

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:06,860
know when we just well wait that's good

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,450
number three be as many things as many

00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,280
people as possible so this is one of

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,950
Debian's great strengths in that term

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,770
its parts of its underlies so many other

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,350
derivative distributions including the

00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,600
all the blends that we have a whole

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:23,420
bunch of embedded devices the entire

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,750
errata pie ecosystem and we're in that

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,910
position because we are just I'm not

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,140
going to say yeah well we can just be so

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,290
many things to different people that

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:36,620
people can take the the base of Debian

00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:39,680
and and tell it to and make make it what

00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,270
they want and apply it to their

00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,090
particularly use case and things like

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,190
that and as long as we continue to not

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,070
hyper focus say on any one particular

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:51,380
area I think we'll still be able to to

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:54,140
be the basis of many other projects and

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,240
things like that and now encourages not

00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,770
only new contributions but also a

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,440
diverse viewpoints of

00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,610
Nicoll input as well so for example

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,350
embedded folks will say oh this is

00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,090
really useful info debian and will

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,510
incorporate that or people from

00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,070
mainframes from this say from the other

00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,800
from top down couldn't say oh this is

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,330
very useful here and things like that

00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,090
all the way down all the way to desktop

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:21,750
users and laptop users etc sexual debian

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:23,700
on phones or Kindles being as many

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,290
things as many people as possible means

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,420
that then we have get a wide variety of

00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,310
input and contributions to the

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,170
distribution and this will be another

00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:35,340
reason why we'll still be here in 25

00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:38,070
years and it's sort of viral in itself

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,720
as well yeah hold ourselves and others

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,000
to high standards so this is not only

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,380
means technically I mean in terms of

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,270
what it really means to be a Delian

00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,060
developer as well I mean if someone says

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,400
oh he's a DD you kind of know what that

00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,260
means in a technical sense I mean you

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,040
can upload stuff to your machine and

00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:58,080
riku but it also just is sort of a you

00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,490
know sort of an odd that that person is

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,230
a kind of good person and we should

00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:04,320
maintain this very high standard of

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,490
ourselves and others in of developers

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,040
and contributors and things like that

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:13,830
but not only that in a sort of them not

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,460
only in the way we are technically

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,350
competent

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,970
in a high standard but also just in in

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,960
dealings with others you know so when we

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:23,700
speak to other people from other from in

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,050
other three software projects you know

00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,060
they're Debian developer their

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,650
reputation is sort of on the line and

00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,170
Debian's reputation is on the line and

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:34,110
so we should maintain that kind of high

00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:38,360
standard and that again will will help

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:41,100
us journey through the next 25 and

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,100
speaking to this people don't tend to be

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:48,000
sort of accidentally successful or

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:51,540
famous or have high respect it sort of

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,220
excellence is something that you sort of

00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,760
have to practice and do every day and

00:24:53,220 --> 00:25:00,210
and focus focus on so for you it's not

00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,460
just oh well I'll alter of behave myself

00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,700
when talking to outsiders but within the

00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,500
project I'll be not so friendly or

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,590
amicable you really have to sort of be

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:14,400
that kind of person all the time

00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:15,840
you think so thank you collaboration new

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,050
naturally we've been collaborating for

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,170
the past 24 and a half years but to to

00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:24,960
see through the next 5 or 25 continue to

00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:27,720
do so so I mean these are things like we

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,000
typically love to do things upstream

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,030
first I mean local patches sort of

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,200
considered it a little bit ugly you know

00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,240
if something can be done that stream

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,250
well will poke it upstream instead you

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,900
know it's just how how things are best

00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,390
done and that's that speaks to our

00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,750
innate and no one really always needs to

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:47,760
be told this so this speaks to our Nate

00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,890
viewpoint on collaboration and things

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,600
along those lines and South sir is

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:54,180
particularly helping this I know that I

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,820
myself have increased a number of

00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,700
particularly small changes small

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,070
meaningful changes that have been much

00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,440
easier to make with with the salsa

00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,570
sister this a surrogate lab systems like

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,030
oh this thing is slightly annoying me

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:11,400
and then when you just can create a

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:13,650
merger crest very quickly you can see a

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,020
lot of collaboration and it gets

00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,610
accepted very quickly so the more more

00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:21,660
of this that we do I think the brother

00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:24,540
as well looks like that Ross - I think

00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,130
we should also increase the and continue

00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,050
to work with our pure blends and

00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:32,120
derivative distributions there are a

00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:34,170
source of great input and energy

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,940
particularly ones that are focused on

00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:39,030
say a particular area sort of like it

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:44,630
for example appliance devices or a blend

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:47,670
that's aimed at a particular country or

00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,800
culture and things like that they

00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:53,220
injectable a very positive energy into

00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,800
the project through the blend and so the

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,800
more we can accumulate that puts

00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,970
incorporate that into Debian itself then

00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,850
then the better and things like that and

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:07,500
well do we need to do better so I mean

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:11,940
there are some things that we can

00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:14,870
immediately we already know so we can

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:18,140
always do with more manpower on the

00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:21,320
all teams they're always understaffed

00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:24,340
and things like that yeah these are

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:29,620
things we sort of know about we're not

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:34,550
they'll go to question of course began

00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:37,030
of course we can thank you by mistake

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:40,340
we're not so not so great at making

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:45,020
archive impacting changes so if we want

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:46,970
to universally change how the Debian

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,440
works as a whole we're still not good at

00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,250
making those changes I mean that's

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:56,120
partly good in that we are and there's a

00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:59,210
small t conservative in nature but say

00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,520
we wanted to everything must happen I

00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:05,090
make it up a a polymer profile that's

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,440
not that easy to get through those kind

00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,990
of changes that's perhaps a bad example

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,580
but those kind of changes we need to get

00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,740
better at and particularly reaching

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,660
consensus on these archive wide changes

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:19,040
because there's always negatives to any

00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:21,170
particular any change of when it affects

00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,350
so many packages and the and the

00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:26,510
distribution as a whole even things that

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,250
people are in broad agreement with and

00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,410
like we produce or build no one's really

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,920
against them but sort of getting them

00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:36,100
through and just getting all of the

00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:39,050
dominoes in line and things like that

00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,059
can be quite quite difficult from a

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,400
technical and to a procedural

00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:44,960
administration point of view it's in it

00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:50,620
because it touches so many parts of the

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:53,480
project we also need to address the

00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:56,540
popularity of the the new software store

00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,350
so this slaughter the flat-pack hub and

00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:02,350
snap things like that they're new

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:04,640
technologies and things like that but

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:06,650
what's the story how do they fit into

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,780
Debian if at all I mean we don't really

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:11,420
have I'm not going to say a policy but

00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,280
we are quite wildly divergent some of

00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,220
our users really love them what are we

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,540
going to do here we don't seem to have a

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,179
we don't really even seem to be talking

00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:23,390
about this particular issue particularly

00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:24,669
cuz it impacts security of the system as

00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,489
well if you're downloading

00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:28,989
random stuff but also from a free

00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:31,059
software and principles point of view

00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:33,100
some of this some of the software

00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:36,239
available in these stores is not free

00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,710
software and that that really affects

00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:40,419
our guiding principles of our social

00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,460
contract things like that so it's very

00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:45,309
important and this is not just snapping

00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:49,720
and fab this is where you have sort of

00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:51,820
quasi stores or plugin kits so the

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,309
browser's typically have an extension or

00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,820
application store built into them which

00:29:54,309 --> 00:30:00,369
can naturally download any sort of code

00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:03,039
that you want again with security and

00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:05,739
freedom concerns there so yeah these

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,259
dilutes the sort of the Debian package

00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:10,690
as a whole and where think we need to

00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:12,909
have we need to be it's time to look at

00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,549
these over the next at least the next

00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:16,960
year and things like that but in terms

00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:18,730
of some concrete things we can all be

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,340
doing I mean one one thing we can

00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:24,609
definitely do is to assign credit a

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:27,700
little bit better I mean we've all had

00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:31,659
an experience where someone has sort of

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,919
neglected to tribute a patch or we you

00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:35,019
know you spend a lot of work on

00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,600
something and it was sort of dismissed

00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:38,049
in a in an in an outright way this isn't

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,419
great

00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:42,580
you know that's kind of thing people

00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:45,929
don't require credit for work but it

00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:48,609
certainly helps and things like that um

00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:51,789
it establishes sort of trust within a

00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:53,529
team as well so if you if you provide a

00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:55,330
patch and then everyone's been working

00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:56,440
together you know everyone just feels a

00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,019
little bit better about working on

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,359
things and sure things get done and any

00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:02,769
further disagreements get smoothed over

00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,090
and things like that so I think that's

00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:05,980
very important than something like think

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:09,269
we can all be addressing a bit a little

00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:13,299
bit better and it's sort of win-win

00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:16,539
it's not giving someone saying thank you

00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:19,480
for a patch explicitly not only makes

00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:21,070
them feel good and it sort of makes you

00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,049
feel like you're part of the team had

00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,059
better so I mean from even from a

00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,799
selfish point of view it makes you look

00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:28,570
good though giving credits and things

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,889
like that so if you heart be convinced

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:33,659
it will make someone else feel better

00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:33,659
perhaps just do it for yourself you know

00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:40,570
on this topic noticed people who are

00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:43,460
particularly lower in self-confidence or

00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,889
or who generally don't do that much

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,840
self-promotion that themselves so I mean

00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:49,519
that allowed people are easy to spot and

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,029
gave credit to but perhaps that that

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,460
quite developer who doesn't doesn't make

00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:58,669
a big noise and sends a patch just say

00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:01,460
you know you're thanking them explicitly

00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:05,259
will be a particularly welcome and goes

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,259
a lot a lot further than you think

00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:12,409
example here's my very very first

00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:14,210
contribution to Debian in 2006 one thing

00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:17,539
to notice is that I screw up the tags

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:20,269
and so I needed to send a separate there

00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:23,149
for the BTS the BTS is controlled via

00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:25,360
email for people who don't know and you

00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:28,039
can set some headers at the very top

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,919
that change various things various

00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:32,629
attributes of the the bug so for example

00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:35,299
you can tag whether it has a patch or

00:32:32,629 --> 00:32:38,090
not and in my very first contribution I

00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:40,909
screw it up so yeah it's all bit so I

00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:44,600
sent this patch along to a this is a RC

00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:47,149
bug for the edge distribution the x-ray

00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,909
the H release which is around 2 which

00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:52,639
was released eventually in April 2007

00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:54,950
and I got a reply back very quickly

00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:57,470
saying rock on many thanks I'll upload

00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,720
this and it eventually ended up in edge

00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:03,710
and this just thank you and I ended up

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:06,620
in the the changelog of of the of this

00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,149
particular package was sort of

00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,330
meaningless because it was just my name

00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:13,220
in some not a very important package but

00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,509
it was amazing and it just sort of you

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,210
know everything snowballed from there

00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:18,529
and throughout that winter I started to

00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,299
contribute a lot more to Debian and

00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:23,269
things like that so just goes to show

00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:26,299
that these small these small thank yous

00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:28,610
and these small remarks do go a long way

00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:30,889
and keep people around the project

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:34,610
longer so I really recommend really

00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:37,429
highly recommend them and be more

00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:39,379
empathetic so empathy is basic I mean in

00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:42,840
many ways of defining it but one way is

00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:45,150
is it's basically understanding

00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,440
understanding the feelings of others now

00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,640
I buy this I don't necessarily mean

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,560
agreeing with them but at least

00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,950
understanding where people are coming

00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:55,470
from and one thing I like to say is that

00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:58,920
open conversations read right not just

00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,900
read only so if you're listening to

00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,400
people if you're reading a mailing list

00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,850
actually try and read what they're

00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,770
saying and often people whilst they

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,390
might be saying one thing on paper you

00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:12,090
try and try and sort of step back and

00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:13,440
and really appreciate what where they're

00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,670
coming from what angle they're coming

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,800
from what their history is and things

00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:20,310
like that and that speaks to the empathy

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,220
like that there's a lot of users and

00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:26,370
developers that are rather unfamiliar

00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:28,770
thus and sometimes we fail to

00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:31,050
communicate very well about what the

00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,140
project is really about a number of

00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:36,540
conversations even this dead kampf where

00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:39,900
people weren't one gentleman wasn't even

00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,820
or wasn't aware of the existence of the

00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,770
unstable distribution thinking it was

00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:48,510
something something turned highly

00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,730
separate from Debbie in itself and

00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,530
things like this and so we sort of have

00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,270
this sort of tragedy where we are

00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,980
providing a lot of things to a lot of

00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:59,010
people but people aren't aware of them

00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,780
due to its marketing or we've labeled

00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:04,220
them wrong or we just not I'm not

00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:07,530
describing them in a very good way and

00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:09,660
be polite when others are not and so our

00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:12,750
mailing lists are interesting at times

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:15,480
and and sometimes it's very very

00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,100
tempting to match someone's energy level

00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,930
should I put it politically like that

00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:22,170
and I think we should all just try and

00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:23,760
just be a little bit more adult

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,270
sometimes and just you know things like

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,690
that

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:30,700
be yeah I mean there

00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,990
another one we could do particularly in

00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:37,480
teams is to give give them good feedback

00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:39,040
this would be great in that with we want

00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,200
to remove the culture in a place where

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,700
people are feel freer to make mistakes

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,590
particularly mistakes are reversible

00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,630
yeah sometimes you may want to ask

00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,490
whether someone would like to receive

00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:55,390
feedback first depending on who they are

00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:57,010
a lot of you I'm not I want to say I'm

00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,740
an expert at doing this at all so there

00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:02,740
may be better resources for them for a

00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:05,140
good tips on providing feedback but I

00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:08,170
mean just to focus on the work as much

00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,870
as possible certainly know I and

00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:12,700
identify identify concrete potential

00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,350
improvements for the future and of

00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:18,520
course naturally avoid personal

00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:21,130
criticism as well so again clearly

00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,260
identifying what they could improve is

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:27,340
very important as well because then it

00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:29,560
provides a an incentive or an avenue

00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:34,960
they can work out what to do next

00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:37,690
I think another thing all perhaps

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,650
developers could do a bit more of a sort

00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:44,830
of self care Debian I think should be

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:46,530
fun it's certainly fun for me and it and

00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:50,170
it should remain fun for people and

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:53,710
people should should be contributing

00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:55,630
whilst it remains fun for them as I say

00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,220
in the Constitution we explicitly say

00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,650
that a person who doesn't want to do a

00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,620
task doesn't have to do it and that that

00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:05,560
really is true I mean if you if debian

00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,930
stops being fun for you why don't stick

00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,430
around like really let me take a break I

00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,740
mean you don't have to martyr yourself

00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:15,880
on this product there are people who

00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:18,610
will step in and take over the tasks I

00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,210
mean that yeah and there are the things

00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:23,770
in life than Debian and it's really

00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,870
important to keep keep track of those

00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:32,650
daily and of course is very important

00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:34,630
but one shouldn't yeah I think you'll

00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:37,840
get where I'm going there and keep a

00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:40,369
supply of spoons so spoon theory is this

00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:44,109
idea that people have a finite number

00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:46,759
of resources throughout a day and and

00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:48,470
it's enumerated by this idea you have a

00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:52,549
number of spoons and you can spend them

00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:55,190
on different tasks something some tasks

00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:57,529
might cost more spoons and others so a

00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,779
difficult interaction might cost you

00:37:57,529 --> 00:38:01,670
your number of spoons and people start

00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:04,039
the day with a different number so if

00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,809
you're good sleep you might start with

00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,670
more or if you're suffering from an

00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:10,009
illness you might war or you're just low

00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:13,569
on them January for whatever reason yeah

00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:15,769
so and just you know keep some spare and

00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:17,450
spend them in depth Ian wines they I

00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:20,089
mean it seems to be a little bit of an

00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:22,519
irony that the swag bag for this

00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:25,369
conference contains a spoon I'm not sure

00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,869
whether that was deliberate or not but I

00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,749
certainly found it amusing from this

00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:33,499
point of view but it needs to included

00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:35,950
chopsticks as well and sometimes just

00:38:33,499 --> 00:38:38,809
let it go I mean we've all had these

00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,849
flame wars or whatever emails and we've

00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:43,130
got and they've just been bugging us you

00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:47,630
know you walk to work and you're just

00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:49,339
thinking sometimes you just have to you

00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,769
know just leaving in a box maybe you

00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:54,859
take it out of the box later but just

00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:56,749
sometimes let it go it's it's it's only

00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:59,569
Debian it's only this massively

00:38:56,749 --> 00:39:02,809
important project but it is only Debian

00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:04,609
sometimes yeah nothing we could do

00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:07,880
sanity better is adopting a sort of

00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:10,309
growth mindset the stereotypical Debian

00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,039
developer is sort of slightly stuck in

00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:15,710
their own at the world and it's often

00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:17,839
quite dismissive of often quite

00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:19,640
dismissive of new things and this is

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,460
great from Debian point of view

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,680
sometimes because as I say we're a to a

00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,960
small C conservative operating system

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,390
and we only release when it's ready and

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,390
we us might we might be slow to adopt

00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:34,369
technologies sometime relative rather

00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,420
distributions but we adopt them when

00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:39,369
they have been proven and

00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,839
hopefully been proven and we can

00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:43,540
actually justify them from that point of

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:45,430
view but we're thinking should at least

00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,109
keep an open mind about new things one

00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,180
quote I came across all a while ago is

00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:51,430
if you find yourself showing contempt

00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,859
for technology or community you probably

00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,940
don't understand what they're all about

00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:57,339
I'm not going to name any particular

00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,700
technologies here to put some examples

00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:03,339
on but you often see whole categories of

00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,109
things dismissed just out of hand

00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:07,420
perhaps there are good reasons for doing

00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:10,180
so but they've just been dismissed out

00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,890
of hand and maybe these people are

00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,920
coming from a different angle that we

00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:18,309
just don't understand yet or we haven't

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,260
been exposed to yet and this is not only

00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:23,650
in terms of sake programming languages

00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:26,049
but in terms of entire technology stacks

00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:28,119
or industries and things like that so

00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:30,510
just keeping an open mind about these

00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:34,390
things will certainly mean that we don't

00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,890
ever get stuck where we are and as I say

00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,319
there's this contradiction in Debian

00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,780
between being slow and conservative

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:46,270
being good but it's also one of our

00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:49,089
weaknesses as well so yeah great whew

00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:53,230
thank you so much for entertaining my

00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:57,250
rambling for the past 45 minutes thank

00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:59,380
you very much and yeah we've got a I

00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,640
think we've got a few bites thank you

00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,470
again for inviting me here and I think

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,940
we've got of quite a few minutes for

00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:06,960
some questions if they're already so

00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,960
yeah thank you

00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:17,010
[Applause]

00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,920
we have one

00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:36,840
hello hello hello hello everyone thank

00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:40,710
you for being here welcome to Def Con I

00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,930
hope you enjoy it from your stats but

00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:45,060
you I was missing how many new

00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:47,970
developers have joined the Debian

00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:50,609
project because I've seen like many old

00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:52,830
names there like in the list is new

00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:54,810
people coming in or it's another do you

00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:57,450
know anything about this well there's

00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:59,940
certainly new people coming in and it

00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,590
was terribly remiss of me not to include

00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,580
that number because that is obviously an

00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:08,599
extremely important number room for

00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,599
improvement always yeah

00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:18,900
thank you thank you yeah um is there

00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:21,780
someone from front desk that can give a

00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,450
number on that maybe someone can find it

00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:31,380
on and then divin'd org and shout it out

00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:31,920
in a few seconds no great any other

00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,510
questions

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,510
Oh switch

00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:48,300
hi Chris hi so what do you think of the

00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,520
things that Debian should probably focus

00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:54,470
on most in the next few years what are

00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,470
we not doing that we really should be I

00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,870
think we should probably be looking at

00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:03,780
some of the adjacent I'm gonna say

00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:07,200
competitors and and seeing what their

00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:09,540
uses are the motivations of their users

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,540
and things like that so you see a lot of

00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:14,490
people what was I encountering earlier

00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,170
just earlier today people a lot of

00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:19,170
people choose distributions on how good

00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:20,670
they look but that's pretty shallow but

00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:24,240
we should try and see where people are

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:25,800
coming from from that point of view but

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,110
that's just one example of many so I

00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,150
think we can learn a lot from on that a

00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:32,370
juror ative x' but we should look for

00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:34,590
the success of of other distributions

00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:35,970
things like that I mean I spoke to some

00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:38,220
of the things we could be doing slightly

00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:43,470
better but that's probably not exactly

00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:45,540
addressing your question and again it's

00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:47,670
difficult as a GPL because it's not like

00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:51,510
a a technical thing like oh we should

00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:53,040
adopt technology X ever Y yeah

00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:55,650
absolutely of course I'm asking you a

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,650
hard question yeah

00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:02,550
and putting me on the spot and I'm

00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:05,040
prevaricated that's a fair answer yeah I

00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:07,980
mean we should I think basically just

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,130
keeping an open mind and just keeping in

00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,690
it as long as we know our options and we

00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,190
are evaluating them sensibly

00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,480
I think that's what we should be doing

00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:19,110
and we seem to have a fairly good

00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:22,470
process for doing that although it does

00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:24,600
require a volunteer willing volunteer

00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:26,850
and enable volunteer just sort of

00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,680
spearhead any particular initiative so

00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:31,410
you know if they come with an idea they

00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,940
need to say I mean to go back to a parma

00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:35,280
they need to come with a proposal and

00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,630
say let's try this and that can be

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,020
evaluated on its own terms

00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:42,890
that's a if we could get a round not

00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,119
requiring that somehow that'll be

00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,660
that'll be good cuz then it wouldn't

00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,430
need - a blocker they wouldn't need a

00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,859
sort of stakeholder to sort of own that

00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:54,650
because that's obviously quite difficult

00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:58,549
yeah okay and then the second question I

00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,650
guess it's probably a a common thing

00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:03,289
that people fear every year so you've

00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:05,410
already been elected DPL twice how do

00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:17,990
you think about a third term

00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:19,519
well I knew Steve was attending UC and

00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:23,359
he has a bit of a habit of asking this

00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:27,170
question and I it really does depend

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:29,660
right now often I'm quite myopic about

00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:31,519
it's often you know the next email in

00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,440
the inbox and it's very difficult to

00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,829
look past that yet alone the next week

00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:40,819
the next dev can't the next DPL term so

00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:45,190
I have genuinely I have not even thought

00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:45,190
about it beyond making this slide

00:45:45,529 --> 00:45:50,989
and of course I wouldn't want to run

00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,989
against you

00:45:51,169 --> 00:45:58,259
so yeah it's certainly something about

00:45:55,529 --> 00:46:00,719
and a lot of it's particularly my when I

00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:03,599
decided to rerun last year was based on

00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:06,689
how well I thought I had done and I can

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:11,689
only really evaluate that nearer that

00:46:06,689 --> 00:46:14,009
near at the time and so yeah thank you

00:46:11,689 --> 00:46:15,809
all right not a question more of a

00:46:14,009 --> 00:46:17,219
comment I have numbers for you on new

00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:22,109
contributors thank you

00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:25,229
so 26 uploading Dedes tuned on uploading

00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:28,529
Dedes and 42 debian maintainer started

00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:30,989
in the last year okay nice ODMs by far

00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:34,969
away the majority nice nice I think that

00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:38,870
speaks to the excess of the of the DM

00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:44,810
process yeah great thank you

00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:44,810
[Applause]

00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:51,880
great again unless that's it I'm being

00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,430
waved at by our video team so thank you

00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,290
very very much everyone knows my face
