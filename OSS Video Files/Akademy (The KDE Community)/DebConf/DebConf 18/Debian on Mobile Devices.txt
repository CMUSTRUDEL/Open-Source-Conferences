After an exciting and incredibly well-attended BoF at DebConf 17 in Montréal, interesting developments regarding mobile devices continued (in no particular order and without any attempt of being complete or fair):

1. The Pyra, while still not released (as of 2018-02-07), nears completion of hardware and casing.
1. Purism announced their plans for the Librem 5, a Debian based smartphone. Their crowdfunding campaign was amazingly successful.
1. Another recent crowdfunding reached their financial goal in only one day: The plan to create a free Linux driver for the Allwinner VPU, started by Bootlin.
1. ZeroPhone has constant progress on both hardware and software side,

as well as many other projects.

Let us look, where we are one year later. Which ideas took off - more or less, which did not?
