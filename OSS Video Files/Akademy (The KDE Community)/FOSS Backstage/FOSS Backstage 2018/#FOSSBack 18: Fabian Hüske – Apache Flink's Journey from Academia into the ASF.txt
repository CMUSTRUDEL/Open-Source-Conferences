Title: #FOSSBack 18: Fabian Hüske – Apache Flink's Journey from Academia into the ASF
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Apache Flink is a project with a very active, supportive, and continuously growing community. Last year, Flink was among the top ten projects of the Apache Software Foundation  (ASF) with the most traffic on user and development mailing lists. Looking back, Flink started as a research prototype developed by three PhD students at TU Berlin in 2009. In 2014, the developers donated the code base to the Apache Software Foundation and joined the newly founded Apache Flink incubator project. Within three years, Flink grew into a healthy project and gained a lot of momentum.

In my presentation, I will discuss Flink's journey from an academic research project to one of the most active projects of the Apache Software Foundation. I will talk about the academic roots of the project, how the original developers got introduced to the ASF, Flink's incubation phase, and how its community evolved after it graduated and became an ASF top-level project. My talk will focus on the decisions, efforts, and circumstances that helped to grow a vital and welcoming open source community.

yeah thank you thanks everybody for for

00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,860
for for joining this talk yeah it's the

00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:17,020
title says I'm going to share the story

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:18,910
of how yeah the about the origins of

00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,980
Apache flying how it started as an

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,960
academic research project not talking

00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,590
very much about that part but then like

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,130
how we moved it into into the Apache

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,500
Software Foundation and what we did to

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,650
grow community and a few lessons learned

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,880
about that first of all a few words

00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,550
about what is a Petri flink

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,829
to to get the context right it is

00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:45,220
obviously an open source project of the

00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:48,220
Apache sofa foundation the software is

00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:52,960
it's a stream processor that processes

00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:55,750
data with low latency at scale so it's a

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,059
distributed system you deploy it in a

00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,239
cluster and then it processes streams of

00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:05,170
data and it consists of API so obviously

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,700
to define the the processing that the

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,659
job that you want to run and also the

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,030
execution engine

00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,950
it runs on clusters from various size so

00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,649
you can run it on a single machine you

00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,329
can also and deploy it on classes to up

00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:19,840
to like a couple of thousands machines

00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:24,609
and it has a very very active community

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,319
and also have for community what are the

00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:28,600
common use cases for fleeing so it's

00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,850
used for a typical stream processing

00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,159
applications like fraud detection I know

00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:37,060
anomaly detection real-time analytics

00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:40,539
machine learning or just crunching data

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,670
in an instrument fashion in general the

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:45,369
software Apache flying is used by by

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:49,060
many companies of various various

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:56,740
different industries such as telcos

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:59,109
there is there's retail there is typical

00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,380
tech companies so it's really really

00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:07,110
deployed or at many many different

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:10,929
companies so how did this all start so

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,520
the software started out as an academic

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:15,580
research project back then it was called

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,630
stratosphere the project was funded by

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,130
the German

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,820
fortunes come and stuff which is likely

00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:26,320
the German equivalent of the NSF in the

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:30,590
US so it's a it's an government-funded

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:34,190
institution to fund research projects

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:37,070
and the mission of the project was to to

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:39,320
develop the next generation big data big

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,980
data analytics platform and for that

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,600
back then the project started in 2010 we

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,040
like did a little bit initial work

00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,390
before that

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:53,500
so the goal back then was to develop a

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:56,390
system that uses MapReduce and

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,290
relational database technology there

00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,520
were a couple of research groups

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,570
involved so this was a fairly big

00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:05,030
project so something like six seven PhD

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,950
students five professors a couple of

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,840
master students working working on this

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,250
and it also got additional funding from

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:17,680
from additional EU projects and got by

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:21,920
that connected in two different research

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,010
institutes in Europe and yeah we all set

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,700
a pretty good track record on scientific

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,350
publications so a couple of years later

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,050
the first generation of PhD students was

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:36,020
about to leave and we are a software

00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:41,240
that was in which we put like more than

00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:44,330
three years of development of something

00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,280
like many many people so a couple of

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,240
person years went through this software

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,250
it was back then

00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,710
state of the art had a couple of very

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:55,120
unique and distinguishing features and

00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:58,490
back then we had already released it as

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,030
under the Apache License so we asked

00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,890
ourselves ok I mean we had released it

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,140
but nobody actually used it

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,320
so we asked herself ok how can we

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,050
continue and we didn't really want to

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,080
abandon the project just angry way like

00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,400
all these three years of work and say ok

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,530
that's it we're going to do something

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,220
else now

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:24,440
so a natural like thought was ok we'd

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,810
like to continue that maybe as an as an

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,090
open-source project and there was

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,860
another thought as well so we were here

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,430
in Berlin we like the city we don't

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,850
really want to

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,160
move somewhere else and it's not that

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,020
easy to find another place or to find

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,690
find find a job in Berlin or back then

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:46,100
at least we could work on on similar

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:50,060
technology so we we thought okay maybe

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,300
let's try this make make a make a proper

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:58,550
open-source project out of a Petri flink

00:04:52,300 --> 00:05:00,800
fund start start a startup and let's see

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:06,160
how it gave us and that's basically what

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,240
we did and so about the open source part

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,580
releasing the surface open source

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,350
well releasing software is open source

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,450
is one thing but then there is a couple

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,310
of other things to it right so you need

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,930
to get people to use the software you

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,800
also want to build a community of people

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,660
contributing through the project and

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,850
make it attractive for people to

00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,510
contribute there you have to figure out

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,100
licensing setting up the infrastructure

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,560
the whole legal framework around an open

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,810
source project so all of that is not

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,250
that easy to not eat not that easy to do

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:41,140
and there's lots of challenges to tackle

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:43,250
about that and luckily there's

00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:47,000
organizations or open source

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:51,650
organizations that exactly help to help

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,620
projects to to tackle most of these

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,420
problems and the Apache Software

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,200
Foundation was kind of like a network

00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:02,240
choice for us and why is that so first

00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,440
of all we got in touch with quite a few

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,390
people from the Apache Software

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,820
Foundation he's about to host the

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:11,030
co-organizer of this of this conference

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,790
here was a guest lecturer at to Berlin

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,610
there were other Apache committers and

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,520
members in our research group the Berlin

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,150
Basterds conference that just was was

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,100
the two days before this conference had

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,110
started here which brought in many open

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,810
source people Titanic was one of the

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:34,790
people we talked to so we got a lots of

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:36,740
exposure to to Apache Forks here we also

00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,580
spoke at conferences we also spoke quite

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,760
early at a

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,460
but in passwords and other conferences

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:47,400
about the stratosphere project back then

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,230
and of course there were also lots of

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,810
other projects in this big data

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,280
processing domain that were hosted at

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,960
the Apache Software Foundation like the

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,050
euro here just a few of them there is

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,970
like if I would put all the logos on

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,700
there you wouldn't see any text anymore

00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,400
so it's like this is basically like the

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,380
home for most of these kinds of projects

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,820
so therefore the Apache Software

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:15,630
Foundation was like the the first place

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:20,610
we were looking at so how did we how do

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:25,650
if you then start this yeah so in 2014

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:28,020
and in April we basically or a bit

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,710
before that we made a proposal to the

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,200
Apache Incubator like the regular

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,990
entering process for Kota nations to

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:40,140
become Apache projects so we made a

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:42,990
proposal to the incubator and in April

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,720
the stratosphere codebase basically

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,910
entered the SF incubator we had to

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,710
switch to the name stratosphere kind of

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:53,100
like a very common name so there's lots

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,560
of software and a few more software and

00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,710
also companies with that name so we had

00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,990
to come up with another name and we

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,790
decided to name give give the so for the

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,400
name flink which is named german for

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,580
nimble and swift and we came up with

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,610
this cute squirrel logo because it's

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,290
nimble and Swift animal and the initial

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,290
commuters were like the cost status we

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:20,700
developers and the main trust from the

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:22,710
purchase of foundation so in incubation

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,050
you we did all the usual stuff we

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,870
basically set up the infrastructure soft

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,910
licensing issues we started growing the

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,950
community mostly from students that had

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,710
already worked with us through these EU

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:37,349
project collaborations which was very

00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,970
very helpful so we already had a couple

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:44,130
of people contributing to the project

00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:45,930
that we then could make emitters and we

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,480
had a pretty good start first official

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,800
release was done in August and already

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,890
in December fling graduated to an RPG

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,080
to a to a top level protection in the

00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,310
same year we also funded data artisans

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,560
the startup that I was talking about

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,680
it's based here in Berlin a venture

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,839
capital fund that as usual and yeah it

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,430
was funded by the core core stratosphere

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,839
team and then some of the flink emitters

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,540
the initial goal of the company was

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,760
basically we devoted like 1% of the

00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,120
resources towards fostering a pet chief

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,550
link our goal was basically make this

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,769
like a like a like a visible project in

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,399
the in the landscape in the potato

00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:30,529
landscape so our main goal was to grow

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,579
community around that helping users

00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:36,829
mentoring contributors helping them to

00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:38,899
become committers at some point but also

00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:41,240
gaining mindshare for this project and

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:44,660
of course also developing flink adding

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,060
new features fixing bugs and so on so

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:51,980
how did we grow a community or what did

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:54,200
we do there so back in 2014 we had a the

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,320
the landscape of projects was kind of

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,600
like competitive it still is but we also

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,670
saw that there is a clear need for for

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,310
further technology that the the Sofia

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,290
was offering so there was a clear need

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,570
for for advanced big data analytics to

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,250
its and there's the walls and there

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,680
still is lots of projects around there

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,690
so probably most prominently Apache

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,529
spark there's a couple of other projects

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:21,220
in periban also h2o and all of these

00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:24,620
projects we also backed by some kind of

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,140
companies or other either big companies

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,730
or also startups with lots of more

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,040
funding than we had we were in Berlin

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:35,209
where our money is not as flowing as

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:38,180
freely as in other places and so we

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,860
somehow had to compete with these

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,270
organizations or with these more

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,579
projects when projects don't really

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,750
compete but still it's a you you're

00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:48,589
trying to get mindshare and if there's

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:51,050
somebody adds more mindshare you you

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:55,490
think ok what can you do about it so how

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:58,579
how did we approach this well first of

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,170
all when you try to get try to get more

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:01,279
mindful for project you have to do a lot

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,589
of talking so you're speaking at

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,180
conferences meetups you're writing blog

00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:06,910
posts

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,820
you try to find early partners and users

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:13,410
that then that you can then help to also

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:16,779
become evangelists for your software and

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:20,620
data artisans the startup started to

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:23,680
quite early organize a fling focus

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,140
conference think forward we started here

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,770
in Berlin in in April we had the like

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,570
the second edition in San Francisco and

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,700
in this in this event we of course had

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,560
people talk giving talks about a passive

00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,589
link how they use it initially these

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,779
were mostly from academic partner so and

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:43,300
academic projects that they did with

00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:45,520
link but we also organize hackathons and

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,370
enter trainings to show people how the

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,290
system works and back in these days we

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,779
already gained a few few early adopters

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,459
ResearchGate which is a company here

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:58,120
from Berlin King which is from Sweden

00:11:54,459 --> 00:12:00,430
Stockholm a boy telecom in France so we

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:05,950
had a first first early adopters of the

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:11,500
software of this software um however it

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:14,140
didn't really take off that well and we

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,050
figured that is like we were kind of

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:20,740
competing with others on the very same

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:24,160
we try to do this the same as other

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,420
other projects we're doing and we often

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,670
hear it ok this is an interesting

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,130
software this might have like technical

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,650
tech technology wise it might be

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,560
advanced but it is less mature it has

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:38,470
less adoption and at that point in time

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,700
we realized that better being better at

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,730
something doesn't really cut it so

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,600
unless you're really but 10x by order of

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:51,209
magnitude better community in my chair

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:54,010
is makes a lot may mix up a lot for

00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:57,430
maybe not having the latest technology

00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:02,380
and in general it's easier to to evolve

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:04,540
technology than to grow community so at

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,589
that point in time we also figured ok

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:10,029
stream processing is an interesting

00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:12,520
interesting trend that might that we

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:15,670
might might go into and we looked at the

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,440
existing solutions and they all had had

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,640
significant drawbacks and we thought

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,090
this is something that we can do better

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:26,140
so at that point in time we basically

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,850
put our resources mostly in stream

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,120
processing features back that before

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:34,870
that was mostly like batch processing

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,310
and at that point in time we we noticed

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,410
that this is really something that is

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,540
that is useful for many for many users

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,760
because we evolved the software in a way

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,900
that we added features that no one else

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,700
at that point in time had and we also

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,340
saw that this software now is going is

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:55,570
being used for for more business

00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:58,410
critical tasks and also so that people

00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,630
are or companies who use the software

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:04,900
let their their the employees contribute

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:08,680
back to the projects and in around that

00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:11,050
phase of the project we or the project

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:15,850
got some users like Alibaba Netflix in

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:18,520
uber which are clearly big users that

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:22,260
can give a statement about hey we're

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,810
using this software today a Petre fling

00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:30,670
has more than 400 contributors we have

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:34,120
38 committers about $10,000 per month

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,740
and last year thing was among the among

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,850
the top ten projects of the Apache

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:41,230
Software Foundation with the most

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,610
mailing list traffic flink runs at runs

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,640
some of the world's largest stream

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,320
processing applications today users

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,250
follow trillions of events per day

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:55,600
through the software and and use it to

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,670
to solve their data problems so what are

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:03,120
the lessons to learn that we did we

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:05,110
basically took out of this first of all

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,310
going with the Apache Software

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,890
Foundation was a really good choice for

00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:13,600
us because it helped us some very in

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:16,300
various ways first of all you get legal

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,670
protection it helps of course also with

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,490
the exposure but also there is like the

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:25,890
the people in the incubator that help

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:28,600
you that that can can share a lot of the

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,940
experience how to grow a community what

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,640
what to do and what not to do too

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,110
to attract people to good people users

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,850
and contributors to your project so that

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,560
was a very helpful also the inertia

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,290
community that we got through our

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,530
academic roots and academia

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,300
helped us so we had already like the

00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:53,230
services software was used in multiple

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,940
EU projects so we had a couple of

00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:59,470
contributors already through these

00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:02,020
collaborations early on growing a

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:06,940
community yeah it's it's a lot of work

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:11,110
it's a lot of talking as well but also

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,730
what we found is that it's that was

00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:15,250
essential for fleeing to find it's right

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,290
right niche so to say like being in this

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,270
stream processing niche doing something

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,750
that nobody are offering some some

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:25,300
features that nobody else offer us being

00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,740
the first one that of course also helps

00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,660
a lot

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,510
enterprise software is a very

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:35,980
competitive space it's very hard for

00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:41,950
projects without full-time developers to

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:43,930
build up a community to have to convince

00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,750
people like also companies to use this

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,460
software since it's enterprise software

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,860
this your your natural users are

00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,260
companies who want to who are asking

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,350
who's who's backing this community is a

00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:59,500
very very important part of that but it

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,930
is we also heard a couple of times that

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,410
it is important that there is also some

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:08,290
entity behind or within the community so

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:11,589
together with a community that has a

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,180
vested interest in in in growing the

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:16,660
growing the community and and having

00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:20,140
those under the project what are today's

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,750
challenges yeah so we have to keep up

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,740
with growing the community maintaining a

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,750
community is also a lot of work so

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,840
helping users discussing roadmap

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:36,270
features features that other and that

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,270
contributors want to want to contribute

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,580
onboarding new committers and then also

00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:44,530
finding this right balance of okay user

00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,600
requests and driving a long-term vision

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,150
for the project for this affair this is

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,210
all kind of challenging and I think like

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:55,150
the next or no not the next stop but the

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:59,200
talk after that we hear something about

00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:02,260
how projects can can can cope with many

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,880
contributors so last the last thing I

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,910
would would like to share i working on

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,970
open source is very very rewarding it's

00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,360
a fun way of developing being in touch

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,370
with the people who use a software

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,350
they're hearing the ideas how they want

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:22,120
to how they envision this of it to

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:24,700
evolve is is very nice and of course

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,050
it's also very rewarding to see that the

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,920
software that you're working on it's

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:34,720
used in a in many different places

00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:37,360
yeah so this is the conference we spoke

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,130
about so we'll have the next edition in

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,500
in Berlin in September here exactly -

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,460
cool - of are I in begin of September so

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,290
if this is something that you're

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:57,370
interested in please sign up and with

00:18:47,290 --> 00:19:00,790
that I'd like your saying thank you yeah

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:03,280
thank you Fabian for this interesting

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,010
talk especially if it's building based

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,940
and from stratosphere so are there any

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:14,200
questions

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:16,330
oh yes see you not good my question

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:21,040
would be how did you convince the big

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:24,190
enterprises to adopt flink like you

00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:27,970
mentioned Airbnb Netflix and all those

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,190
whether purely because you had a niche

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:35,260
feature set compared to spark streaming

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:38,980
or other technologies I think it in the

00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,930
so yeah we did not really reach out to

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,600
them so for instance for for Alibaba or

00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,870
we like they they approached us and told

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:52,290
us okay we're using your software

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:54,630
and I think what really it was this not

00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,820
being better at something ads were being

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,290
better being slightly better at some

00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,080
something that somebody else is doing

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,330
who has a bigger community it was really

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,070
this being able to do something that

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,140
nobody else can do at that point in time

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,910
so it's really having these features I

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,320
mean I didn't really go into the details

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,820
of what flink is doing but having

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,770
features like exactly once processing

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,050
and event and processing event time

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,760
semantics this is something that no

00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,170
other stream processing open-source

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,330
stream processing system back then could

00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:29,730
do so I'm I'm my my explanation is like

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:34,200
that these features have helped to win

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:35,880
these users for for the software you

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,370
mentioned that you have a lot of mailing

00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,170
list traffic and one thing that I hear a

00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,480
lot from new Apache projects is that

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:45,360
mailing lists are a thing from the past

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,370
and we should go move beyond them I'm

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,320
curious did were you already using

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,960
mailing lists as your main channel

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,500
before you join Apache or did you adapt

00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,250
to that for Apache so the development

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,650
before that was mainly centered at

00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,780
Huebel and so I mean sure we had some

00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,700
communications with also external

00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,770
contributors but they were not really I

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,260
mean these were all project partners

00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,390
from from academic projects so we had

00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:17,670
really not there was a mailing list but

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:19,559
it was barely used yeah so I mean this

00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:25,200
mailing list thing was was pretty new to

00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:27,330
us how to deal with that we get requests

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,679
sometimes from users to add something or

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:33,780
to offer something like a select channel

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:37,110
but so far on the community didn't

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,550
really go into that I'm not sure like if

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,910
I would get anything done if we were

00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,910
they with that

00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,500
okay thank you very much Fabian and

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:52,279
thank you the audience

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,279
