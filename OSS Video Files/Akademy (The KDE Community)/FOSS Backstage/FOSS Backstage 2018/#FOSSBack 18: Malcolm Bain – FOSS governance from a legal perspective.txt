Title: #FOSSBack 18: Malcolm Bain – FOSS governance from a legal perspective
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	This session looks at the benchmarking, analysis and recommendations carried out from a legal perspective for setting up an organisation to manage/govern a public sector open source community. We look at both legal organisational structures as well as the roles, responsibilities and key legal decisions that are part of "legal governance" of open source projects: Members, Boards, Committees, voting processes and requirements, licensing, trademarks, and liabilities

	00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,939
okay we're gonna have to think it's nice

00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,990
and sunny outside okay well good

00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,389
afternoon and sorry about the slight

00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,720
delay here this is the kind of the

00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:17,510
temperature in Berlin and the the the

00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,130
state of the sunshine and I have the

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,840
honor to have the last talk in the main

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,900
rooms which obviously is everybody's now

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,230
outside in the beer garden and and so so

00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,820
and it's a pleasure to be here I think

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,230
you're doing it pretty bad because you

00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,850
started the day with legal compliance

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,489
and you're ending the day with legal

00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,989
governance there's something wrong in

00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:38,899
this way I know I just want to take off

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:40,460
from the previous talk about exactly if

00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,730
you are going to set up a governance

00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,140
structure what are the kind of like

00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,120
conditions and criteria and what are the

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,129
steps that it would be what do you need

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,870
to take into account to do this in a way

00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:54,079
and this is because we've been working

00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,329
with Barcelona City Council in freeing

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,180
quite a lot of software and they're

00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,289
looking at how to make these projects

00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,510
more independent from the government

00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,759
from the public authority and so that

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,710
they can gain more sustainability more

00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:09,469
more adherence from from from other

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,979
other projects okay so obviously the

00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:14,659
government's role the structure

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:18,109
basically defines roles procedures and

00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,429
responsibilities and and this always

00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:20,569
happens in any community actually

00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:23,149
whether it's kind of like three people

00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:25,939
or or 3,000 and there's always some form

00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:27,979
of implicit or explicit governance

00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,209
structure what happens if you're

00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,490
actually thinking of setting up an

00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:33,469
entity is that what many many things

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,099
that are implicit become structured

00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:39,439
become formal and the the whole process

00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:41,029
of creating this type of entity legal

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,659
entity or whatever it is foundation

00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:46,609
nonprofit whatever entails a deep

00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,929
reflection about exactly what those

00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:54,289
roles processes rules are that you want

00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:56,060
to set because actually once if you do

00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:58,429
have a fixed entity or a legal entity

00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,749
it's much more difficult to change than

00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:01,849
if you're just an unorganized or

00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:04,459
disorganized or unform alized and

00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:07,549
community obviously the key questions

00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,959
you need to look at are so if you're

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,369
thinking of governance model what what

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,769
effects that

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,450
what's the creep creep criterias take

00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:16,590
into account when you're looking at the

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,200
governance model

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,480
and who's going to take this decision

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,769
what do we have to understand so that we

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,269
get a governance model that is

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,250
appropriate for the community

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,470
it's obviously normally different for a

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,260
you know post University small project

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,330
starting up from something enormous like

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,970
Apache or Mozilla Foundation which have

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,220
their own very strict and you know what

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,390
strict or sort of established governance

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,549
was okay

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,170
so obviously what one looks at and this

00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:45,959
is what we've been trying to look at for

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,750
the for the projects in in the in City

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,910
Council is is that the different

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,799
dimensions characteristics because it's

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,970
very very different and creating a

00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,299
project which is an infrastructure

00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,000
project to an end user web application

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,470
type thing the stakeholders are a

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,910
completely different the people who

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,470
involved are very different

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,140
I'm the motivation for freeing the

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,670
project is is different the ecosystem

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,950
where you are that the technology you're

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,209
using may be completely different now we

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,110
see these are factors that you need to

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:18,450
take into account and look at one of the

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,060
key issues we've found is the timing so

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,459
what time in the life cycle of a project

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,410
from from it when it starts two or three

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,600
people or the government putting in some

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,769
money to sponsor a new piece of

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,260
technology for the government

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,299
infrastructure and you know when are we

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,799
going to formalize this when do or do in

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,389
in at any moment you actually need to

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,639
formalize it into a legal entity or not

00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:43,470
that's very very very important

00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,419
obviously taking this stuff is not the

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,310
end of the in everything you can't

00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:49,139
visitings but the cost of change

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,910
obviously is quite high I'm quoting

00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,940
quite difficult so that's one of the em

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,440
but the factors we we look at to decide

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,519
you know do we want something that's

00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,019
very formal do something that's very

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,450
informal do something that's very

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,650
process heavy do we want to formalize it

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,720
in documents do we want to have a

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,380
conflict you know conflict explicit

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,079
conflict resolution process so how do we

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,599
want to structure our community okay so

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,989
we've we've looked at and and we've done

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,690
it in nine steps obviously you know it

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,209
could be 18 could be to but I mean we've

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,250
kind of come up with I think eight steps

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,680
and some documentation that the things

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,480
to look at useful things to look at and

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,070
I'll run through these very quickly

00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,150
a bit one by one because I'm a lawyer

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,400
and we'd like to go kind of like

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,870
developers we do things a little bit in

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,350
a structured way so the legal editor

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,570
must be decide on is is what components

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,390
so these roles rights and obligations

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,810
obligations the decision-making system

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,860
so that obviously is a procedural thing

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,560
it's nothing to do with a legal

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,020
structure yet okay good then what we've

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,970
looked at is those roles procedures then

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,890
get put into a box let's go get a

00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,420
presenter structure and the question is

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,580
well what is the best structure to put

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,680
it under and this obviously will depend

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,390
on the country depend on objective but

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,100
that's the the reflection needs to be

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,660
there is do we need anything at all

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,980
there's a bit what I'm Cornelius was

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,620
saying you know if you don't need it

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,900
don't do it because it's it's expensive

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,330
it's formalizes something that may be

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,250
better if it's informal and it

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,410
crystallizes a certain way of doing

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,000
things which may be the community or the

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,190
technology you're building actually does

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,440
not go in that direction okay and then

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,390
specifically from a legal perspective

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,090
what what's the legal dimensions that

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,680
get managed by this entity and here we

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,470
go obviously at the IPR we got license

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,890
got trademarks and and even some form of

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,570
conflict resolution okay so the the st.

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,790
next stage is okay once you decided well

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,410
we're going to go down this path and we

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,150
do need to formalize our governance

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,590
structure and we may actually have to

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,300
create or thinking of creating a new

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,560
entity what are the what's the purpose

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,780
of this and key here and in our project

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,400
for the City Council was to create a

00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,860
certain level of Independence from the

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,900
original seed of the seeding which was

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,670
in the council to create an entity which

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,710
is more independent and therefore it's

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,620
more open in a certain way to receive

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,660
other contributions to receive other

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,280
participants taking part in in the

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,500
governance it's not just one single

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,870
public authority who's governing this

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,450
entity but it's opening its doors to

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,670
other entities okay another typical

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,170
reason would be for financial reasons if

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,270
you want to participate in any funding

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,580
projects if you want to have any kind of

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:31,120
a formal contractual relationship with

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,040
sponsors or whatever it's RC very useful

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,290
to have a legal entity who can you know

00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,290
sign on and sign a contract enter into

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,420
contract so there are there are several

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,460
reasons for this it may be actually that

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,199
you have a very informal

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,580
and a bit disorganized project you think

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,009
this is one of the ways to formalize it

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,410
to set up to set some bylaws or other

00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,300
form of governments and documents and

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,370
and rules and make it a little bit more

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,139
less chaotic okay

00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,090
so these are the slides I'll leave

00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,460
before anderson discussions that we've

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:05,080
had between different types of things

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:07,750
the next one is when you're building

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,250
this or you're designing this entity or

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,569
this governance structure and i say

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,389
still governor structure because you may

00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:16,270
not in the end have an entity at all

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:18,490
what are the characteristics that you

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,050
have to try and really focus on okay and

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,419
I think there are four ones that we've

00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,370
we've when benchmarking other projects

00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:26,229
from our own experience there are four

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,910
criteria here which which I think are

00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,130
absolutely important essential to

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,750
respect if you're going to go down this

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,580
road the first one is it has to be very

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,650
participate or the whole community has

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,199
to be actually consulted and and joined

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,180
in clarity and simplicity

00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,159
don't make it too heavy anything it's

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:46,240
too heavy obviously is not going to work

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:48,490
that hard a flexibility so build in

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,050
mechanisms for evolving as the

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,669
technology evolves of the community

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,159
evolves it's very important that your

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,050
governance and procedures can evolve as

00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,460
well and finally transparency

00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,349
transparency means publishing this

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,570
information making its available so that

00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:03,820
new members coming into this structure

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,750
or this process can actually join and

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,860
see what's going on how its managed okay

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,810
what do you what does one actually

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,820
decide about what I want to look at well

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,060
there are levels so there's the micro

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,919
level of personal level interpersonal

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,199
there's the kind of like the community

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,690
internal dynamics of the project itself

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,520
and there's the Metro level which is

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,440
external the community and its

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,909
relationship with the outside and that

00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,800
could be something like different

00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,849
projects associating with each other and

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,529
building something larger

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:34,959
it could be just purely financial and

00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,120
some form of financial relationship with

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,669
it with some sponsor or government

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,950
funding okay and within actually when

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,450
you're in the the the process we think

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,160
that there are four main areas obviously

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,930
legal being lawyers obviously the legal

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,240
becomes first is the most important and

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,490
then a Cornelius the software comes

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,839
first we know that okay the community

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,300
probably comes first actually it's about

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,370
people and the technical

00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,630
the money now if there's any economists

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,450
in the room we all know that money comes

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,709
first but um anyway they're all equally

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,630
important let's just put it that way

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,130
let's be a bit more democratic and they

00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,410
all need to be looked at okay and the

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,970
slides for those who are watching you

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,190
can look you can look at them this is

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,200
quite a lot of work that we've done in

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,500
in these different dimensions so so in

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,870
in the legal just for example what type

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,970
of membership rules the bylaws of this

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,829
association all this an entity that

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:29,140
you're looking at what are the formal

00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:30,760
documentation in in terms of IPR in

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,779
contribution agreements we've talked

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,690
about a lot about contribution

00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:37,089
agreements trademark management IP our

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,519
licensing convening this type of thing

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,440
that's the legal competence and what

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,680
there's stuff about community technical

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,720
and economic which I won't go on ok so

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,490
you've decided to that you do actually

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,589
want to set up a more formal governance

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,950
structure you've thought about the whys

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:55,060
and the who's and the how's so then we

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,160
look at and then then you say well

00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,709
within this structure what do we do so

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,930
it's the previous slide and now we say

00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:04,450
well who does it who's actually going to

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:08,020
be I'm governing this this this

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:11,110
community or this this structure again

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,899
benchmarking traditional open-source

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,399
projects and actually larger entities we

00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:17,529
usually there seems to be three or four

00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,570
levels there's usually in a form of

00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,250
assembly which means everybody who

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,029
participates in the community has a

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,279
voice then there's usually obviously for

00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,050
more efficiency management purposes

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,850
there's a some form of board which could

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,440
be an ex-con executive committee or

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,890
whatever but this is the kind of the

00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,230
day-to-day decision taking which then

00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,550
may also delegate to one layer down to

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,230
committees so you may have a community

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,199
committee a technical committee a

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,579
management committee a finance committee

00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:47,050
it's allocating specific

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:49,329
responsibilities to members of the

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,010
community so they can focus on or on

00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:52,180
what's needed I mean when I say

00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,709
committee it could be one person on a

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,060
committee of one which is great for

00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:58,029
voting purposes because you always have

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,010
unanimity and then below that again

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:02,050
working groups and obviously you know I

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,690
think plan Drupal these very very large

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,120
organizations have significant different

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,430
dynamics than if it's you know one a

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,730
free man show or three lady show

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,140
but in the end the the what one looks at

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,980
is generally these four levels of

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,560
decision

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,360
okay so there's debates and what what to

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,620
do with the assembly I'm who should be a

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,910
member of the board what the rules of

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,580
the board how'd you get them on board

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,810
how'd you get rid get rid of them

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,610
committees what decisions do they take

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,620
what responsibilities what's the process

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,839
long and obviously someone like a patch

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,140
it has it has very committee based and

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,180
they are very strong procedural systems

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,850
in there come in in their committees

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,350
other ones not so okay couple of

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,390
examples here actually we looked at

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:47,740
asana which is the public administration

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,149
entity in the USA on half application

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,680
and they have their governance

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,630
structures divided into two so they have

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,880
a council which is basically the public

00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,279
authorities are participating

00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:00,339
stakeholders and they have a core team

00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,480
and with some admin staff very important

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,000
admin staff because the community

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,920
managers there and this is kind of

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,130
division of roles between strategic and

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,100
and financing issues and knowledge and

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,959
actually running the show okay one go

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,540
into plan bit too complex but it's also

00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:18,010
an interesting one okay meetings and

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,480
events that's also something that's very

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,700
very important because this is the glue

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,320
that brings the community together and

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,760
and running those meetings running those

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,860
events Lashley's is heavy work it's a

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,180
lot of heavy lifting and very important

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,860
for the for governance to take into

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:34,839
account so we've got all the substance

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,240
of what we're going to do what box do we

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,010
put it in and whose it may depend on the

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,540
country I mean they're you know them in

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,640
the USA they everything's a foundation

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,320
but if you look behind it they're not

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,360
always what we would call a foundation

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,260
often there are nonprofit entities

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,880
corporations whatever usually for tax

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,290
reasons this is very different from a

00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,029
German foundation version from the

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,750
Spanish what we would call in fundación

00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:00,490
in Spain Association so this really

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,440
builds specific to the jurisdiction

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,640
which may raise the question in which to

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,890
restriction which country do you want

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,420
missus to be because you know often

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,310
these projects are international and

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,620
although there may be some dominant

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,870
feature like in my projects it's it's

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,610
Spain in the end you may say well no

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,170
let's go to the UK well no it breaks it

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,260
we don't go to the UK let's go to

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,820
Belgium for example let's come to Berlin

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,400
and and this is a good place to be

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,510
and

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,260
we have a look at the legal structures

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:29,570
available in that jurisdiction so I run

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:33,980
through run through these but details

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,340
for the slides so you know what you want

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,600
to do

00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:40,790
you've got the box to put it in okay as

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,320
a lawyer obviously I like to focus on

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,990
what are the specific legal dimensions

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,890
over the management and usually this is

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:51,500
one thing hopefully to deal with put in

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:54,050
the box and never touch again this is

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,880
kind of the best system because you know

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,110
the IP I once it's fixed good we know we

00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,880
have our processes and conflict

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,800
resolution we never want any conflicts

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,320
and obviously we certainly don't want

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,980
any liabilities so if you have to pull

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,600
your legal process box out of there you

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,130
were probably in bad news anyway what do

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,940
we look at well we look at IPR which is

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,440
obviously the most important

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,730
intellectual property rights copyrights

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:19,130
in the code pattern problems for some

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,780
projects we look at contracting with

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,640
third parties if you have actually

00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,930
sponsors this in for example in the

00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,090
public authority community is quite

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,770
important because quite a lot of the

00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,170
development is under public contracts

00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,240
and and therefore you know how that is

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,610
organized and who has the IPR through

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,460
the public contracts is quite an

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,640
important factor to take into account

00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:42,620
very different from a purely voluntary

00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,560
committee community where there is no

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,330
specific public involvement okay so we

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,740
look at that we look at liabilities and

00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,350
how to minimize those this is why you

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,790
have these big disclaimers and license

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,440
and then formal conflict resolution if

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,570
things really really get hot and you

00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,490
can't resolve this through the usual

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,590
community processes okay

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,980
so again very briefly I've already

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:06,350
mentioned most of this so I think what

00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,150
we're seeing in the more formal projects

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,560
is that everything we've been talking

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,150
about today what was Shane was

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,880
mentioning this morning in terms of

00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:16,880
compliance open-chain looking at

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,960
screening looking at code this is

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,570
something naturally is getting more

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,000
important as projects gets larger and

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:26,120
larger and obviously the exposure to

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,500
having any issue is greater so that that

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,800
does need to be taken to account and

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,709
looked after carefully okay

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,360
what else trademark more and more

00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,980
projects are registering their

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,269
trademarks it's it's their brand it's

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,759
their identification and it's often when

00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:47,569
there's a fork that has a problem but

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:50,029
it's one way for a community to focus on

00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:52,699
and keep people involved is through

00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:54,829
their recognition of who they are you

00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:55,399
know like things I'm on my t-shirt and

00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:59,329
everything like this

00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,860
okay um finally so once you've done all

00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:02,809
that the question is well how do you get

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,420
there because we've with all this great

00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:07,129
intellectual work no way we want how do

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,350
we actually get there and obviously the

00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:10,910
basic rule is you don't do it by

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,920
yourself you don't impose it top down

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,179
like in any open source community you

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,369
have to speak with the members of the

00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:18,920
community and you have to them to say

00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:21,499
usually on a consensus or silent

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,769
consensus lazy consensus and that's the

00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:27,589
way we're going okay break it down into

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,910
packages so it makes it easy because it

00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:30,230
can seem to be a really enormous thing

00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,019
to look at all this legal business

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,369
management community stuff break you

00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:36,980
down into packages and it makes it much

00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:38,240
more manageable and you'll probably find

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,829
it's really good because the person who

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,480
looks after each package suddenly

00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,490
becomes the person responsible for

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,759
community management and later on in

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,649
this association and finally obviously

00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,509
documentation how do you document this

00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,279
well depends on what type of institution

00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,069
you have usually have some bylaws you

00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:57,230
have some internal regulations if you

00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:59,110
look at mozilla apache there's a typical

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,189
foundation eclipse foundation very large

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,019
but other ones that poem they all

00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:04,880
document everything they do transparent

00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:09,529
on a wiki don't keep those documents

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,549
hidden in any manner and hopefully you

00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,799
don't have to pull them out of the

00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:13,819
drawer yeah my experience as a lawyer if

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,100
you have to start looking at the

00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:18,470
documents you're in hot water it's if

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,789
you're already in trouble okay usually

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,500
you want them to be put away in a box

00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,569
forget about them and then everything

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,649
the community takes care after itself

00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:26,630
okay

00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:31,309
that's basic we don't to say basically

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:33,169
we're wrapping up obviously an entity

00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,750
legal entity adds a layer of complexity

00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:37,820
a delay of cost so if you can avoid it

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,590
maybe it's a good idea but there are

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,840
there may and they usually are some

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,880
significant in good reasons to set up a

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,780
specific legal entity a financial

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,630
reasons

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,980
tax reasons you're going very very

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,270
international and people want to know

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,790
what the rules of the game are so you

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,500
have to express those rules and and one

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,740
way to do that obviously have community

00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,150
documentation and at one moment maybe

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,070
membership and things it's also question

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,810
of commitment the actual fact that you

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,030
do incorporate all that you do creates

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,140
an entity means that you're committed in

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,250
there for the long term

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,380
you're looking for something you're

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,850
looking for sustainability it's not

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,080
something that tomorrow the lead

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,030
developers disappear and you've got

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,640
nothing left except some code hidden in

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,260
a git repository if you do actually have

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,880
an entity you're making a political

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,890
statement that we want to be here we

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,600
want to be here for the next period and

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,780
we've we want to do it properly

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:32,940
thank you very much

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:32,940
