Description: 
	Drawing on 15 years experience in open source from contributor through committer and infrastructure volunteer to Director (with various other roles along the way) this session will explore patterns of organisation and behaviour that may be indicative of a community heading in an unhealthy direction. The session will also look at the potential corrective actions that can be taken, both at a community level and an individual level, to attempt to correct these patterns.
