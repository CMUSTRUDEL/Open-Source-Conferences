Title: #FOSSBack 18: Mark Thomas â€“ Community anti-patterns
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Drawing on 15 years experience in open source from contributor through committer and infrastructure volunteer to Director (with various other roles along the way) this session will explore patterns of organisation and behaviour that may be indicative of a community heading in an unhealthy direction. The session will also look at the potential corrective actions that can be taken, both at a community level and an individual level, to attempt to correct these patterns.

	00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,730
my name's mark Thomas I'm primarily a

00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,220
committer on the Apache Tomcat project

00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,610
but I've also taken on a few other roles

00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:18,040
at the SF over the years involved in

00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,050
Commons Dubbo helped out on

00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,150
infrastructure and probably most

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,730
importantly for this I'm one of the

00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,859
foundation directors and in the role of

00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,840
director one of the things we do is

00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:30,010
Apache projects record every three

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,590
months on the current state of their

00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,180
project and as a director there are a

00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,860
number of things that when I read in a

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,930
report a particular phrase or a

00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,150
particular description it generally

00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,030
comes with a oh no here we go again

00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:46,720
and the purpose of this talk is to try

00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,699
and share some of those ideas some idea

00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,670
of the sorts of things that tend to act

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:53,440
as warning signs for us for open source

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,909
projects at the perhaps heading in the

00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:03,400
wrong direction or heading towards some

00:00:54,909 --> 00:01:05,260
sort of trouble so Apaches got a wide

00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,579
range of projects depending on how you

00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,770
count it it's 200 250 and some of those

00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:14,320
are struggling some are doing very well

00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,560
so we're very healthy some not so much

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,210
and there are some common themes so

00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,829
hopefully by sharing those common themes

00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,009
we'll be able to help some other

00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:26,380
projects I should stress these aren't

00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:28,530
the SF views there's certainly not my

00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,439
employers views these are my personal

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:36,579
impressions as somebody who's reviewed

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:39,399
well that's safe we've had three to a

00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:41,530
half years 200 project yet must be over

00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:45,130
a thousand project reports easily by now

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:48,399
so it's very much what I've taken from

00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:51,990
looking at those reports so let's look

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,460
at some specifics first of all releases

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,609
in my experience releases are always

00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,409
catalysts for activity whatever the

00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:02,079
activity state of a project is if you

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,880
have a release then you automatically

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,969
get more activity users download the

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,310
products they install it they might ask

00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:10,690
a few questions if you're really lucky

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,489
they might report a bug if you're

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,190
extremely lucky you might get a patch to

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:17,430
go with it but they're always a catalyst

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:21,180
for activity and without releases

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:24,420
well what's the point i I see projects

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,909
that have been ticking along for you

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,450
know getting on for over two years and

00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:32,909
they haven't had a release but how is

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,379
that going to encourage users hey yes

00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:35,969
there are some users that will download

00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,980
the source code and build it from source

00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:40,409
but the majority of users don't do that

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,579
majority of users want the binary and if

00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:44,790
you're not doing releases you're not

00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,500
providing the binaries you're instantly

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,930
cutting down a huge proportion of your

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
user base so releases are vitally

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,000
important and they really should be easy

00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,700
in the tomcat project we do monthly

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,950
releases and I would say one of the most

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,200
important useful things we did as a

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,510
project and we did it about four or five

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,609
years ago now was taking a long hard

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,519
look at the release process and do

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:13,739
everything we could to automate it now

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,329
it's not completely automated there are

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,000
a few places where there's some manual

00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:19,739
steps but they're very very trivial and

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,780
to give you an idea when I started on

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,489
the Tomcat project I tried to build

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,319
build it from source and I was really

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,879
pleased that I'd done it it was three

00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,220
months later I realized I complete built

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,510
completely the wrong thing I was using a

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,310
totally different version of one of the

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,889
modules and the first time I did a

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,419
release it took me days to figure out

00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,879
what I was doing and releases were

00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:42,599
always a little bit painful so we did

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,609
some work on that and about 18 months

00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,319
ago we had a security vulnerability so

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:50,819
we had to release everything which at

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:53,189
the time was five versions and it was

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,479
just after I'd sent the notice out

00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:56,220
saying yet the final version is

00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,720
available it's all good to go eyes about

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,000
to send the vulnerability announcement

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,989
out and somebody pipes up on the dev

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,930
list um but there's this regression it's

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:11,220
really really badly broken not at all

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,709
drat need to redo the whole lot and it

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,349
took me less than an hour to completely

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,900
cancel the old releases fix the problem

00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:20,489
and re-roll five whole releases but that

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,310
was because of the time we put into the

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,919
automation and what I see as a director

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,510
with some struggling projects is will

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,400
say no if you could get a release out

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,630
that would really help yes but we

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,170
haven't got the time

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,120
nothing but it shouldn't be that hard

00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:39,840
really it really should be dead simple

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,000
to get a release out so what I would

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,530
urge all projects to do is your work on

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,060
your release process make it as smooth

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,920
as you possibly can because whilst you

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,140
might have lots of people available now

00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,750
at some point in the future as the

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,700
project matures as the user community

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,340
and the development community does begin

00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,750
to shrink as they inevitably well then

00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,160
you still won't be able to get releases

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,470
out and the easier you can make the

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,850
releases the better it'll be and the

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,680
longer your project will be able to

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,910
survive there are there are projects at

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,880
Apache at the minute they're in the

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,100
position where if they could get a

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,840
release out they could carry on if they

00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,920
can't get it they can't get a release

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,750
out so they're probably going to end up

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,210
in the attic and that's what's causing

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,340
them effectively to be retired and it's

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,110
a really simple problem to solve if you

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:30,030
solve it now when you've got the time to

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:33,240
look at it next one on Sokka is adding

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:35,970
committers as a general rule I would say

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,870
the lower the bar is the healthier the

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:43,020
community taking another example from

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:46,680
Apache the Apache subversion project has

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:50,280
a very very low bar to commit a ship you

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,690
come along you provide a patch write a

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,160
couple of patches there's a pretty good

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,740
chance that somebody said oh right great

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,090
here you go but there's no point of

00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,590
supplying your patch you've got the

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:03,300
commitment you apply it now granted they

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,090
they grant you permission to do that one

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,680
to a narrow area but they only enforce

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,780
that socially not technically which I'll

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,940
come on to in a minute

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:15,000
and it's really predicated on the basis

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,540
that it's all the source code in version

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,520
control

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,650
if you mess it up we can undo it in it

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,530
it's not that big a deal

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,140
back when I joined the tomcat project a

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,820
little bit later I joined the PMC which

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,620
meant I could go back and look at the

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,540
private archives and while I was doing

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,420
that I came across the thread where

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,040
there the then PMC was currently was

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,250
discussing me becoming a committer

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,350
and one of the comments was absolutely

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,490
spot-on it was yes most of his patches

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,590
are fine

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,539
occasionally they're completely off the

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,030
wall it's like he doesn't have a clue

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:51,509
what he's doing with Java and actually

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,220
yes that was correct I didn't I only

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,810
just started using Java and I was

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,810
literally teaching myself as I went

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,460
along and there's one in one patch I

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,169
submitted that had like a page of code

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,539
to replicate searching for a string

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,509
within another string only had looked at

00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:08,580
the API Docs and yeah it's already there

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:11,370
but I just reproduced except didn't have

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,900
the experience but what the person who

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,590
made that comment settles but that's

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,490
okay

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:18,840
if he messes up I'll just veto it and

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,819
they made me a committer and as it

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,430
happens I didn't mess up at least not

00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:25,830
that badly from that point onwards but

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,979
there was a recognition that it was okay

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,840
to take a risk because if I did do

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,610
something wrong you'd be able to reverse

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,069
it you'd be able to undo the change and

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,840
the sorts of thing that caused me to

00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:38,940
raise my eyebrows and start getting

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,800
worried is when I see projects starting

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,300
things like oh we have a new camp we

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
have a checklist to decide whether or

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,800
not we're going to offer to make

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,460
somebody a committer and normally what's

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,750
happened is some news proposed somebody

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,070
for it to be a committer and somebody

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,870
else's oh no that they're not quite

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,550
ready they don't have enough experience

00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,810
they don't we haven't done enough of

00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,909
this they haven't done enough of that

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,919
and there's somebody else to say yeah

00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,699
but so-and-so never did that and we made

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,469
them a committer

00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,620
and they'll end up being quite a long

00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:09,419
protracted argument and the solution

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,259
nine times out of ten I know let's

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:16,740
document some nice objective criteria as

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,759
to what what where to set the bar as to

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,539
whether somebody should be a committer

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,659
or not and it sounds like a great idea

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:25,889
for about 30 seconds and then you look

00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,319
at it a little bit more closely because

00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:31,409
oh you have to have at least 10 commits

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,329
well yes there's a difference between 10

00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:35,969
commits and each introduce a big new

00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:39,990
feature and ten commits that each fix a

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:43,589
tiny documentation patch Oh mmm okay and

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:46,200
what about the one line commit but it

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:48,000
fixes a really critical bug that's taken

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,459
you know months of effort to track down

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,400
solely well let's say that it's got to

00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,079
be 10 substantive commits great we're

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,490
back to subjective language again and

00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,620
the

00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,140
starts all over again because the next

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,820
time you try and propose a committer you

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,520
end up arguing over whether the commits

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:09,650
are substantive or not so it doesn't

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,880
help the other issue is that the lists

00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,700
of what you need to do to become a

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,280
committer always get longer they never

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,830
get shorter and eventually they end up

00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,480
reading like you must have contributed

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,280
to the users list for at least a year

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,530
must have implemented at least three

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,270
major features must have fixed 20 bugs

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,990
must leap tall buildings with a single

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:33,590
bound and it's just ridiculous

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:37,330
and it's nearly always a sign of a

00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:39,950
project that is being fairly insular

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,390
fairly suffering and not reaching out to

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,690
the wide pool of people that could

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:47,960
potentially contribute so whenever I see

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:52,000
committed checklists my recommendation

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,620
always just throw it away in Tomcat and

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,230
all of us have yeah we have all have our

00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,660
own particular bars I have a micrometer

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,940
checklist as it were is fairly simple if

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,370
I see a patch coming from a name that I

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,300
recognize that probably means it's time

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,800
to make them a committer

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,630
because they've done enough in the

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,130
project that I recognize their name and

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,780
I look at that and I know the patch is

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,130
going to be of a reasonable quality but

00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,780
they've probably done more than enough

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,460
actually to become a committer and that

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,800
that's as low as the barrier get so

00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,470
couple of patches and then we'll offer

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,640
to make you a committer

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,020
the other thing that I do look out for

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,480
is the directories when projects haven't

00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:30,320
added committers for over a year that's

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,700
again a sign of well you know look life

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,190
gets in the way people's priorities

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,480
change committers generally do tail off

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,980
over time if you're not constantly

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,350
adding new committers then at some point

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,210
you're going to run out so again we look

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,740
for projects that haven't been that

00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,210
haven't been adding to their community

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,280
aren't seeking to grow their community

00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,630
as a sign of something that might might

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,720
be going wrong again it's not going to

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:56,240
go wrong tomorrow but long-term it does

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:58,580
pose a risk on the topic of committers

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,380
dominant committers is another potential

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,620
issue and this is something I worry

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,390
about in Tomcat because I really I'm the

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,180
only Tomcat committer who is paid to

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,370
work on Tomcat full-time and yet the

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,470
other committees are paid to work

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,210
Tomcat that they've got other parts of

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,300
their day job my day job is pretty much

00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,830
100% go and work on Tomcat so something

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,740
I always have at the back of my mind is

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,450
it would be very easy for me to force

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,470
stuff through on Tomcat the way I think

00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,850
it should be done and it really what it

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,870
really comes down to is the speed of

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,279
decision making so what I look for what

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,950
I trying to stop myself doing what I

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,839
look for in other projects is if a

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,850
project decision needs to be making for

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,370
example Tomcat is talking about shall we

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,230
move from SVN to get is that a decision

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,600
that somebody says oh I think we should

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,370
do this 30 minutes later right no

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,740
objections crack on I'm gonna do it or

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,470
do they allow enough time for the

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,690
discussion do they stay silent long

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,610
enough for everybody else to have an

00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,260
equal say in the discussion and one

00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,460
thing that it's very easy to do is if

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,500
you're on a project full time is

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,320
instantly respond to every message on a

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,480
topic that you care about and you end up

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,490
dominating the conversation and again

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,260
it's stopping you you look is that

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:16,440
happening if so that's potentially a

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,850
warning sign now it's not necessarily a

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,510
going to cause harm to the project

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:25,150
directly but what it can do is it can

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,589
put other people off and everybody can

00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,150
start looking towards that one person

00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:29,950
well what the science I think what do

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,420
they think and you end up with the

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,820
community is always looking to one

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,070
person for where should the project go

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,690
what should happen and that's not really

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,459
certainly at Apache how things event to

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,160
work it's meant to be collaborative it's

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:44,320
meant to be consensus based and you what

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,420
you really want is the people able to

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,529
say if they disagree with that one

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,360
person because they're not going to be

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:51,190
right all the time say no that's wrong

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,390
we don't want to do it like that we want

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:57,130
to do it like this so as I'm looking at

00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,750
mailing lists for projects as I do there

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,570
their monthly reviews what I'm looking

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,459
for is who posts the list most often and

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,020
what sort of one of the proportions of

00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:07,390
those posts and when I see somebody

00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,920
posting far more than anybody else then

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,230
I sort of tend to dig into it and look

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,580
so you know are they allowing time for

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,190
other people to have those discussions

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,839
or are they dominating the project and

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,839
if they they are dominating it and

00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,270
riding it then it's a well maybe back

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,320
off a bit give other people a chance

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,889
give other people a voice

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:31,300
and try and encourage other people to

00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:32,470
step up right so moving on from

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,860
committers want to talk a little bit

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:38,769
about tooling next and really that this

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,490
is related to process and some of it

00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:44,250
stems from the time I've spend

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,690
volunteering with infrastructure team

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,040
occasionally what we'll get as the

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,990
infrastructure team is a request that

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,019
says please could you configure JIRA

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,490
with this special custom workflow and

00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:57,670
we'll get about a three-page document

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,769
that sets out each of the 20 steps an

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,839
issue has to go through who's allowed to

00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:04,089
transition the issue from what step

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,600
stage to what stage at what point and a

00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:09,630
whole bunch of rules and there's a

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:15,009
couple of things I don't like about that

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:16,240
first of all is it takes time for our

00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:18,209
valuable infrastructure staff to

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,649
actually set all of this stuff up

00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:22,569
secondly experience tells me in about a

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:24,880
week you're going to ask us to change it

00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:27,160
because it wasn't it wasn't quite what

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,510
you really meant or having tried it in

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,949
practice doesn't quite work the way you

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:36,399
want and thirdly at some point in the

00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:37,899
future on a semi-regular basis you're

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,459
going to need to do something to one of

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:41,110
those issues that your workflow won't

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,630
let you do and the only way you'll be

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,160
able to do it is so infrastructure could

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,990
you please change the state of this

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,730
because we need to do X and we can't

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,510
because the workflow rules don't let us

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:57,760
and it's ended up enforcing this rigid

00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:59,139
process which I don't think particularly

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,139
helps at least not the technically

00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:03,610
enforcement it's fine to have a process

00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:05,949
fine to have a standard way of doing

00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,050
things but it's also good to have the

00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:11,230
flexibility now sometimes it's nice to

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:14,110
be able to break the rules also taking

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,600
another example from Tomcat for a while

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,829
we worked on a review then commit basis

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,230
which meant that if you wanted to make a

00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:23,259
change to a release branch you were

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,360
required to propose that change get

00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:26,920
three committees to vote on it and that

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,810
you had have a majority of people saying

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,160
yes that's an okay change to make before

00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,399
you could then actually apply that

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,920
commit but that was the entirely social

00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,709
enforcement there was nothing Technic

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,610
all ensuring that that happened so

00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,769
occasionally

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,250
when we needed to bend the rules it was

00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:47,410
easy we just did the commit so all

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,839
critical security issue is dead easy to

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,870
reproduce it's an obvious fix we need to

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:56,680
get the release out just do it

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,060
and yeah you do it with a I'm breaking

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,399
the rules this is why I'm breaking the

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,860
rules if any if anybody you know we can

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,300
go back and fix it later but this is why

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,160
I'm doing crack on a do it and it was

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:10,180
never an issue whereas if we've got

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,519
everything strictly enforced by

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,320
technical means then it makes all of

00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,389
that a lot more difficult it slows you

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,930
down and it essentially gets in the way

00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:23,589
you lose that flexibility and I'm seeing

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:28,990
similar things with Jakarta ee as its

00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:31,029
moved to eclipse issues around every

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,740
commit at least in some of the projects

00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,269
I'm involved in has to be reviewed by

00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,600
somebody else before it can be applied

00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:39,610
and that's great if people are paying

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,380
attention but when they get distracted

00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,880
elsewhere you end up with a pile of

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,550
commits just building up because

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,310
somebody who's got the time can do and

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,959
it's simple truth typos changes it's

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,029
nothing particularly complicated but

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,130
it's all built up because there's nobody

00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,930
to review it and that's not a

00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:00,339
particularly motivating position to be

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:02,079
in so again the process is is causing

00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:05,169
more harm than its that's into this

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,850
intended to fix generally social

00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:07,689
controls work a lot better than people

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:11,770
think they will

00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:14,290
so the subversion project as I said they

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,089
will if they make you what they call I

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,130
think is it partial committer or in

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,839
initial committee or something they say

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,000
you've got commit rights to this bit of

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,100
the source string actually technically

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,169
any Apache committer

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,270
has got commit rights to all of the

00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:30,900
subversion source tree but what they

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,890
rely on is the social convention that

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,419
somebody isn't just going to walk in

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,100
make a commit and walk out they will

00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:37,419
they will discuss it on the dev list

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,380
they will introduce it and that works

00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:43,419
and HTTP DS bug tracker they use

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,040
Bugzilla and it's completely open

00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:46,600
anybody can open a bug anybody can

00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,860
comment on a bug anybody can close the

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,130
bug anybody can mark a bug as a

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,920
duplicate

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,840
what that allows is if you get somebody

00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,330
who's particular inches well okay I'm

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,310
not much of a coder but you know I

00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:01,550
really understand httpd and I know how

00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,050
to configure it so what they can do is

00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,850
they can go through the backlog and say

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,160
oh this looks like an interesting but

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,900
can i reproduce it yes he I can

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,570
reproduce it here's a better test case a

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,160
clear a test case or actually no I can't

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,720
reproduce this oh that's because it was

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,820
fixed five versions ago right we can

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,590
close that bug there's nothing stopping

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:22,040
a new contributor diving in and doing

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:23,510
that because the the only security

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,250
around auxiliaries you need to have an

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,430
account to do any of that and anybody

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,460
can get an account and his Bugzilla

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:33,680
filled with spam no guess we get the

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,960
occasional spammer but they're easy to

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,310
deal with yes we get the occasional

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,010
person abusing it but I think in what 15

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:46,400
years of administering bugzilla for

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,220
Apache I've had a ban one user for being

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,750
a pain in the neck and the benefit that

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,990
you're the cost of that it took was

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,760
about 30 seconds to do maybe 10 minutes

00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,050
reading the emails to just convince

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,760
herself that the project was right that

00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,850
they did need to be banned but other

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,650
than that it would no hassle at all and

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,020
the benefits all those projects have got

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,340
is that it's much easier for people to

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,100
contribute much easier for them to be

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,350
able to get involved so rigid processes

00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,210
are always things that I tend to raise

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,610
an eyebrow about if they're if they're

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,900
strictly enforce processes are fine you

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,100
know having stuff set out you know the

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,290
way you like to do things they'll be

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,550
good reasons for that but enforcing it

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,370
particular are technical means and

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,790
removing people's flexibility that I see

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:31,160
causing more problems than it solves

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:33,260
that this next one might be an ASF

00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,230
specific one it depends how you organize

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,510
your open-source projects but at the SF

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,560
everything is it should be consensus

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:44,090
based so if a decision needs to be made

00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,130
somebody says right on the dev list we

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,690
need to decide on what to do with this

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,010
this is what I think or these are the

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,690
options what other people think you have

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,690
a discussion and you move towards a

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,700
consensus occasionally I see projects

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,970
saying oh we've appointed XYZ as the

00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:02,030
project manager wanting to do what

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,659
exactly and when you dig into it since I

00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,799
Oh

00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:10,039
they they prioritize the open issues in

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,539
JIRA or they decide when a release is

00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,309
going to happen or what fixes are going

00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:14,840
to go into what release and I'm you know

00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:16,399
that's just alarm bells all over the

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,559
place for me that yeah that's not how an

00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:25,220
Apache project is meant to work by all

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:28,399
means have a priority list for your bugs

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,809
inner issues and have the community vote

00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,899
on issues to decide what order the

00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:34,159
community would like them fixed but

00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:36,109
developers certainly to Apache men to

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,220
individuals so if somebody wants to work

00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,609
on something halfway down the list

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,109
that's what they work on having somebody

00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:45,669
saying right you do this you do that you

00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:47,809
do that that's just not at all how a

00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:49,039
pattern the Apache community's been to

00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:51,739
where it should all be about scratching

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,359
your own itch so no a/c project manager

00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:59,690
appearing on an apache mailing list that

00:20:53,359 --> 00:21:03,559
tends to send an alarm bell for me this

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:09,080
next one is really hard to spot it's a

00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:10,249
private communication it's certainly

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,190
it's hard to spot if you're outside of

00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:15,109
the community yet is there some core

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,379
group of the community that's discussing

00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:20,479
things in private and then sort of

00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:22,789
announcing what's going to happen to the

00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,769
rest of the communities it were though

00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,119
for me as a director reviewing project

00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:28,190
it's easy because I have access to all

00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,389
the private mail so the first thing I

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,639
tend to do is go and look at their

00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:34,190
private mailing lists and what I hope I

00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:36,049
see is basically next to nothing a few

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,059
personnel decision decisions so

00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:40,249
discussions as to should we invite this

00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:42,499
person as a committer they're held in

00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:44,629
private because you don't want to say

00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:46,190
well actually and we think they've got

00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:47,599
issues in this area this area and this

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,879
area you don't want to have those sorts

00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,499
of discussions in public so those sorts

00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:53,720
of personal issues there on the private

00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:57,590
mailing list other than that hopefully

00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,349
it might be the email from the board

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,389
saying it's time for your project your

00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:03,649
report please can you produce it and

00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:05,210
that goes to the private list just

00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:06,619
because it's the easiest way to get it

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,389
in front of the right set of eyes it's

00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:10,549
not a particularly private thing but

00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:11,929
otherwise it should be pretty quiet so

00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:13,399
when I look at a project and I see that

00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:14,960
their private list has got four times

00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,700
the volume of mail than the dev list

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,700
then I begin to say

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,830
okay things are probably aren't heading

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,070
in the right direction here and again

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,750
there are examples where we have

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,870
projects that are having huge

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,150
discussions huge amounts of energy

00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:34,610
pouring into what maybe isn't

00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:37,240
necessarily the most important issue of

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,200
the day on the private list meanwhile

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,550
hardly anything is happening on the dev

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,690
list and the project isn't moving

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:46,820
forward I think my generally my

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,350
recommendation is that there shouldn't

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,940
be that much private now and if you're

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:53,540
pouring energy into those sorts of

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:56,930
discussions maybe just stop take a pause

00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,580
and think is there something more

00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:02,330
productive we could be doing with this

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,430
time is it better to spend three months

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,650
arguing why the project isn't successful

00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,060
on the private list all it'd have been

00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,210
better if we'd spend that energy on the

00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:12,950
dev lists moving the project forward I

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,120
know where I think the project which one

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,280
of those choices would lead to the

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,710
project being in a better State but

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,700
obviously I can't direct projects on

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,540
what to do so of course we can just

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,880
nudge them in the right direction

00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:27,530
the one that's hardly said you know

00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,150
anybody to identify really is when

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,580
communication starts happening off list

00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,050
so that's when rather than using the

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,850
project's private mailing list there's

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:39,560
some other communication whether it's

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:41,270
happening within a company or on some

00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,790
private chat system or something and

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,840
it's not obvious to the community that

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,360
that is happening and it's not

00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,010
accessible to the community and it is

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,510
really difficult to identify because you

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,000
can only infer that it's happening

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,880
because you'll it'll be you'll see

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,590
things like there's something will

00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,870
suddenly appear on the dev list so

00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,030
here's the roadmap for the next 12

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,070
months okay where did that come from

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,690
because where was it where was the

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,470
discussion about that's a fairly obvious

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:11,030
one or suddenly there's an announcement

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,150
that the project's help holding a

00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:15,440
conference somewhere in three months

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,470
time and here's the call for papers and

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,760
you're thinking great but this is the

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,860
first we're hearing of the conference

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,270
where was it decided that we wanted a

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,430
conference what the topic should be

00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,080
where it was going to be and all of that

00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,420
sort of stuff where's this call of a

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,260
paper suddenly come from those are quite

00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,090
easy

00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,640
to spot that clearly there's something

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,080
going on off list and it needs to be

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,880
brought back on list to get the broader

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:44,660
community involved the harder ones are

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:47,180
when there's coordination going on

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,680
between different committees so you can

00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,880
see that one when you look at it more

00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,760
closely think well okay if they

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,220
committed that feature and then they

00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,710
committed that and then that meant that

00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,560
person committed that but when you look

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:03,470
at the timing and the size of the commit

00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,140
it looks like well they couldn't have

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,490
written that without knowing that but

00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,530
that wasn't committed until yesterday

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,180
and they committed that six hours later

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,130
but there's like three thousand lines of

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,200
code there and it's horri

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,180
it's obviously dependent on that so that

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,770
you then realize that there's some sort

00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,500
of coordination and communication going

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:24,050
on off list which again isn't allowing

00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,600
the entire community to be involved and

00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:29,930
to agree the direction as a whole and

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:34,790
that's quite difficult to spot but but

00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:36,050
again what it does is it makes it harder

00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,630
for new people to get involved because

00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,370
there's obviously some there's something

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,990
going on that you're not you can't quite

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,490
put your finger on that you're not you

00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,800
can't quite see that you're not you

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,850
don't quite understand and then that's

00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,810
not really quite off-putting or

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,810
somebody's new to the community

00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,970
moving on to policy and another one that

00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,180
might be a bit ASF specific I caught

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,950
call this policy bypass the SF doesn't

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,740
have that many policies but the ones

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,910
that we do are there for for good

00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,160
reasons and lessons that have been

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,660
learned from the past and if thing if

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,470
the projects operating correctly the

00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:14,750
policy shouldn't get in the way it's

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:17,750
when I see conversations along that

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:21,440
essentially how can we get around this

00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:23,000
policy or how can we phrase this thing

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,890
that we want to do that isn't really

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,010
conformant with the policy in such a way

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:30,170
that the board thinks it is and that

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,030
just raises a red flag for me I mean if

00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,920
the policy wording isn't clear then yes

00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,660
please let's let's fix it if you

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,090
genuinely think the policy is wrong then

00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,580
please let's discuss it but if you're

00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,510
trying to work around the policy then

00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,800
that's

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,850
pretty strong indication that you're

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,330
doing something that you probably

00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:50,630
shouldn't be doing and that's the point

00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,950
to stop and so ask the question if it's

00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,320
if it's not already explained you know

00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,820
why does the policy say this what what's

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,340
behind it what are we getting at and

00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:02,060
then hopefully steer things in the right

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,520
sort of direction so how taking those

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,930
sort of individual examples of different

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,610
things that race from up flags what I'd

00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,980
like to do so take a couple of

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,600
generalizations from that and I've

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,250
mentioned it a couple of times first of

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,550
all these technical controls versus

00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:18,320
social controls as much as you can my

00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,940
recommendation is keep the technical

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,040
controls to a minimum technically keep

00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:25,450
it as wide open as you can and use

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,590
social norms social conventions to

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:29,390
manage that this is how the project

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,940
typically do things but retain that

00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:34,010
flexibility we said also let's we evolve

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,780
things if you have a rigid technical

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:41,480
process people have to do it that way

00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:43,250
and that they can't evolve the process

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,840
they can't tweak it to make it a little

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,150
better when this when they spot a road

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,070
bump if it's all socially based then

00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,780
things can is much more easy for things

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,250
to gradually evolve over time you can

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,230
try something a bit different once and

00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,270
see whether it works and you have those

00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,950
opportunities so my strong

00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:02,120
recommendation is you know social

00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:04,580
controls not technical ones second one

00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,920
is barriers generally the lower the

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,860
barriers the healthy of the project will

00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,870
be we have a number of projects that

00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,300
have very low barriers to entry they

00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:16,910
attract large numbers of committers and

00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:20,420
contributors and they are very healthy

00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:22,280
the projects of having problems tend to

00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,570
it's not a it's not a perfect

00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,400
correlation but they tend to have higher

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,460
barriers to entry it's harder to become

00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,380
a committer there's more technical

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,730
controls in place so the lower the

00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,530
barrier you can make the barriers the

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,710
easier it is for people to get involved

00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:38,600
the easier it is for their contribution

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,160
you to use their contribution them to

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,850
feel valued and hopefully contribute

00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,490
back again so that brings me to the end

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,680
of what I'm looking to the emcee so I

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,560
have a couple of minutes for questions

00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,150
I'm afraid I don't so i'm around and the

00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,290
rest of the day you'll find me up around

00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,120
the apache lounge

00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,530
if you want to discuss anything that

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,450
I've talked about today tell me where

00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,560
I'm wrong please do come and find me and

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,780
I look forward to speaking with you

00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,190
thank you

00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,160
[Applause]
