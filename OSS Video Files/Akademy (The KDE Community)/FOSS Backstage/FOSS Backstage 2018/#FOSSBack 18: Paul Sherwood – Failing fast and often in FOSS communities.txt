normally I don't introduce myself but

00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,550
then I saw Lamia introduce himself and

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,200
oh I'm gonna do that

00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:17,119
so I sing in a band I'm in award-winning

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,949
feature film producer which means

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,420
absolutely nothing because I lost a

00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,190
significant amount of money making a

00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,470
feature film

00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,570
I wrote the software Commandments 20

00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,010
years ago and that kind of sets the tone

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,840
for the rest of what I'm about to talk

00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:33,769
about I'm very opinionated about

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,449
software so over 20 years ago I thought

00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:37,100
I already pretty much understood what

00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:38,870
went into software engineering and I was

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,120
very clear to explain all of that to

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,290
customers and in general I tend to agree

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,320
with me recently for better or worse I

00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,300
wrote some software in the open mainly

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,050
to prove to some colleagues that I could

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,510
still write software that's called ybd

00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,340
my blog posts such as they are I blog

00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,739
about once a year on something that

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,039
really annoys me typically is a dev

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,840
conversion I'm Python Ruby get C and vie

00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:07,909
in spite of people saying that these

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,509
days we should all use IDs

00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:13,600
why is fine for me thank you very much I

00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:17,990
have trust issues I really don't trust

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,579
most software I care deeply about that

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,590
because I've got young children and

00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,749
working in the automotive industry and

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,549
we're about to do autonomous vehicles

00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:28,579
and I'm thinking what can possibly go

00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:31,429
wrong I've spent some years now working

00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:33,560
with various automotive companies and as

00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:35,749
I have been known to say to them and to

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,439
say in public in other venues a lot of

00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:40,849
those projects are bordering on chaos

00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,919
we're not sure exactly what's landing up

00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:45,560
in the cars let alone what decisions we

00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:47,209
might make based on that so I am deeply

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,149
worried about the quality of software

00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:53,779
engineering I'm I'm trying to fix that

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:55,969
and I compensate for the opinionated

00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:58,909
nurse and grumpiness by being strictly

00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:00,880
honest so I do not lie in business and

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,380
I've held to that line for over 20 years

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,139
this pisses some people off because I

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,579
tell the truth about things and as one

00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:09,470
of my colleagues said a trouble is Paul

00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:13,879
you make people look bad and you don't

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:15,950
apologize so you get what you get so

00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,330
coding is a much friendlier organisation

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,000
than I am but I am the

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,830
Oh of code think coding specializes in

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,530
embedded system software and primarily

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,740
we help much larger companies tackle

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:31,160
hard projects around open source

00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:34,400
embedded Linux that kind of thing now we

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,890
have failed hundreds of times in the

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,550
open and I recently realized that

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:42,950
actually it's been a key factor in what

00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,170
we've learned so I've been involved in

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,630
the open source arena now since about

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,940
2010 late 2010 and I've been learning

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,700
ever since then so I now know a whole

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,390
load of stuff I didn't know 20 years ago

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,740
because of what I've learned working

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,060
with open source people so I'm very

00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,180
positive about the open source

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,370
communities in general but in the course

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,959
of the last few years I've had some

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,300
really disastrous experiences and I'm

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,640
going to share one of them in detail but

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,450
all of those I could talk for days about

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,450
the problems that we've exposed there

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,750
often to do with politics to do with the

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,030
actual people and the agendas of the

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,050
organizations that are involved in

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,070
large-scale open-source projects these

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:27,380
days it's no longer a hobby kind of

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,120
scale environment I don't think it

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,750
husband for a lot of a lot of years but

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,980
what may not be obvious to contributors

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,870
on the ground is just how much

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,610
machination and politics and company

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:42,920
stuff is going on behind the scenes of

00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:44,870
their favorite projects so in spite of

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,950
all the failures and if you were to

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,720
google and read some of the emails

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,860
change that I've been involved in

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,560
although other people be involved in

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,280
from coding you'll see we've managed to

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,940
frustrate and upset quite a lot of

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,680
people but here's one specific example a

00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,140
few years ago we were heavily involved

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,500
in a thing called Geneva and that's

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:06,610
around the taut emotive software and I

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,220
tried really hard this is five years ago

00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,530
to explain to them that security was

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,440
going to be a problem so this is the

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,930
deck I started trying to show and I

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,900
prepared pretty well better than I

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,310
preferred for this talk I had detailed

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,060
discussion with Greg Troy Hartman about

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,190
LTS an LTS I and the I was wrestling

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,930
with what do we do to upgrade the Linux

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,570
kernel over the

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,830
term so I had this whole slide deck and

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,160
I started presenting it to the greater

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,139
good in Geneva which is notionally open

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,449
source expert coming up with the core

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:44,320
Linux solution for cars so I was

00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:45,610
explaining how security coupled with the

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,550
amount of software that we have in cars

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,460
now and yadda-yadda-yadda

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:57,460
and how fast linux is changing and the

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:59,650
fact that we're connected meant that we

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,080
have a load of changes happening as time

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,099
goes by in the kernel and even the

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,380
stable stuff is changing a lot and

00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:10,060
everybody's going to have to upgrade

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,320
over and over again I got about halfway

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,830
through my talk I got to about this

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,940
stuff and then the room on maths pretty

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,830
much told me Paul you don't know what

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,169
you're talking about security in

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,900
automotive is not a problem you're

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,520
exaggerating it we've been doing

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,550
security and other domains for decades

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,530
and I was heckled now that wasn't the

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,060
first time I was heckled in Geneva thank

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,010
you for being so polite and quiet and

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,690
not heckling me it's quite often the

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,220
people literally don't like my slides

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,460
enough that they start shouting at me

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,289
from the floor to derail me so you've

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,470
been very friendly so far hopefully I

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:46,210
won't annoy you guys so literally I

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,620
struggled through about half of this and

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,500
then gave up I was trying to explain how

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,870
complicated LTS I was and how stupid it

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,610
was because actually it meant that

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,080
silicon vendors were going to land their

00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,280
stuff in the wrong place they were not

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,840
going to land it in main line and

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,389
therefore in some cases it was literally

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:07,930
just going to create chaos but I got

00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:10,060
stopped so it ended up with obviously I

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,659
wasn't positive I wasn't popular but I

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,750
ended up writing that in public now bear

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:18,280
in mind I'm a small representative of a

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,259
small company we're about

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,180
well now we're approaching 100 people

00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:24,099
but this time we're about 50 people and

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,430
I pretty much wrote to Geneva in public

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:29,349
and said look you're just around

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,030
now that email sat on that list now for

00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,949
a couple years no one bothered replying

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,940
in public but you can imagine all kinds

00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:40,349
of things went on in private so what

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,070
I've discovered my opinions are my own

00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:42,639
different people encode think it

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,999
disagree

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,469
with me via McLeish I have arguments in

00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:49,330
coding as well as with customers and

00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:50,169
with open source projects so it's

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:55,060
probably me

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:56,650
but what I've concluded is that Foss is

00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,659
not a community and anyone that talks

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,610
about the community is misunderstanding

00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:03,419
the scale and complexity of the

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,849
situation I mean if you check my timing

00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:10,229
its thousands of communities lots of

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:13,090
them overlap there's lots of different

00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:15,580
ways that people interact you knows tiny

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,680
projects huge projects some of the

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,300
larger communities in effect are members

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,969
only clubs now the Geneva is one example

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,860
but I could point to lots of other

00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:28,659
organizations and say it's the same kind

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,219
of thing if you're not paying the fees

00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:31,719
to be part of the club you're not

00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,610
getting in in effect if you're not

00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:36,639
following the rules that they set for

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,960
you you're not getting in so one example

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,759
Lynne ro

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,710
arms stated official open source

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,469
organization we tried to contribute to

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,659
non-linearity wanted to do open sourcing

00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:52,330
open source development including if

00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:54,339
necessary reverse engineering of their

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,409
graphics stack and we started a project

00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,169
called or we helped one of our engineers

00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,520
start a project called Lima

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:02,469
unfortunately arm did not like that very

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,000
much dinero certainly didn't like that

00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,710
very much and we were told that actually

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,199
no if we wanted to contribute inland ro

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,789
a we would have to pay B we would have

00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,289
to provide the engineer and see our

00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:17,250
engineer would have to do only what they

00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:20,800
told them to do by then so in some cases

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:24,490
it's very much a situation of our rules

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,930
our game okay and the lesson that I

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,729
learned from that and other experiences

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,430
is make sure you know what the game is

00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:31,779
and whether the rules that they're

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,890
playing by are things you want to

00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:39,760
actually play by now here's the thing

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:41,979
don't you dare call my baby ugly if you

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,329
turn up as I have done in multiple

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,589
open-source projects that said you know

00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:45,370
this is pretty rubbish isn't it can we

00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,120
can we do better

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:51,069
it tends not to go down very well

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,260
unfortunately I've done that to at least

00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:55,540
one project where coding was primarily

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,589
driving the development

00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:02,019
and how that played with my colleagues

00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:03,430
the upstream folks almost certainly in

00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,940
most of the established projects are

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,440
relatively good at what they do that's

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,089
one of the things that is really quite

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,959
exciting about open source that there

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,069
are lots of projects where there are

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,180
amazing engineers working it on upstream

00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:18,009
that does not mean they're right all the

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,930
time and it does not mean that they're

00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,930
thinking about the changes that have

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,459
happened since they started this thing

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,880
and in some cases when you turn up and

00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:30,579
say look it's 2015 or 2018 we really

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,579
could do something different it can be

00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:35,529
extremely disruptive for all that

00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:37,959
community in the sense of it literally

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:42,220
changes or it could have an effect on

00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,779
the world view so that's not a very

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,190
productive way of being either I've

00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:46,959
learned that on multiple projects now

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,269
and in the end the reason I brought the

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,459
ybd thing was to literally prove to an

00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,110
open source project that their stuff was

00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,740
not good enough and that I on my own

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,769
could do it better

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,600
and sadly I succeeded and in the process

00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,120
I caused at least one of my colleagues

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,010
to resign saying actually that's a bit

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,069
unfriendly anyway right shouldn't have

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,949
done it anyway it's hard to collaborate

00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:12,010
in a snake pit let me just spell it out

00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:13,510
wind river I'm sorry there are lots of

00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:16,000
great people working in Wind River but

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,970
in my personal experience trying to

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,889
collaborate with Wind River absolutely

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,269
disastrous because they're just the in

00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:23,350
practice were always happening was they

00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:25,089
were trying to sabotage what we were

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,120
doing we're offering work for free we're

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,560
bringing software into the open for free

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,420
and trying to advance the state of the

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,149
art trying to advance the industry and

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:38,709
literally they were hell-bent on holding

00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:41,019
things back and making it worse now very

00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:42,730
risky naming a name like that but Wind

00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,079
River already know that I hate them so

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,670
it doesn't really make any difference

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,410
this is not the first time I've said

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,449
this and as I said there are some good

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,800
people in Wind River and at least most

00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:55,750
of the people I used to have to fight

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,279
with are no longer there one other thing

00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,500
I've discovered is it's there's just so

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,589
much hype and nonsense in Foss there is

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,380
in the rest of the world we learned the

00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:06,760
hard way that just because some big

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,230
companies present that they're doing is

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,050
fantastic project and spending a fortune

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,300
on

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,630
creating the next big embedded distro

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,649
let's call it I don't know me go that

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,779
does not mean that they're going to

00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,490
follow through and when they rename it

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:22,040
and call it Tizen that doesn't mean

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,529
they're gonna follow through either when

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,470
you look at the long game

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:29,029
I have deep-seated trust issues I'm

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,860
trying now to work out which

00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:33,370
organizations which projects could we

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,510
actually trust for the kind of

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,220
super-heavy software that we're talking

00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:40,190
about in autonomous vehicles and other

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,100
industries and these problems are not

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:47,120
really getting sorted properly yet we're

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,410
right now in discussions with a part of

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,630
one of the Linux Foundation's

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,660
organizations where because we are

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,640
relatively expert in long-term Linux we

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,079
were invited to work on civil

00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,810
infrastructure platform which is

00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:02,060
software for power stations and trains

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,579
and you know really serious stuff and

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,740
then at the moment what we'll locked

00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:09,829
with is that one guy in the world

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,870
that has been prepared to maintain a

00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:15,430
single learnt Linux kernel for ten years

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:18,320
and he happens to work at Ko tink and

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:21,770
CIP in effect needs to maintain a kernel

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,670
for the rest of eternity and it's really

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:28,790
struggling to find anyone to do that so

00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,380
it's hard and I philosophically would

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,230
say it's it's actually just a mistake to

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,880
even try that because Ben who is the the

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,770
chap in question as categorically said

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,100
having done it once he would never do it

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:42,740
again it's it's the wrong way to do it

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,200
if you build it they will not come

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,060
necessarily I've certainly learned this

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,430
multiple times but this is not just open

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,310
source just having a better mousetrap

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,899
does not lead to a community and you're

00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,279
probably thinking I can see my no one

00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,370
wants to be in a community with Pauli

00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,970
pisses everybody off it's not quite that

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,589
simple I think you need to get all of

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,870
your ducks in a row you need to have

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:07,610
great software and you need to have the

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,910
right outreach and you have have to have

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,640
the right attitude in the project and

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,279
for better or worse although I really do

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,199
respect and love great engineers at

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,390
times engineers are not the best

00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,769
advocates for the work they're doing in

00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:25,999
my own person

00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:28,429
experience so key let's not want to

00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:33,860
leave you with I'm still on time it's

00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:35,480
pretty good up streams are not generic

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,689
you know that it really does come down

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,939
to specific people on a specific project

00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:42,769
and specific organizations if you get to

00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:46,309
the kind of scale I'm talking about with

00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:47,959
some of these examples so understanding

00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:48,589
who the people are and why they're doing

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,029
what they're doing

00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:52,069
understanding the organization and why

00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,119
it is doing what it is doing is crucial

00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:56,720
to working out whether there's any real

00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:59,239
merit in spending any time aligning with

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,239
or working with a specific project and

00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:03,579
often the agendas as far as I can see in

00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,809
some of these very large

00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:08,209
organizationally sponsored projects is

00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:11,389
not what is being stated in public every

00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:16,220
day on the mailing list I'm sure I'm not

00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:17,600
alone in having discovered this so it's

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,040
not necessarily the case that the

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,529
software that's market or the project

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,079
that's marketed biggest is even remotely

00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,209
successful market marketing is not

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,679
connected to engineering some of the

00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:30,049
most successful open-source projects

00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,699
were and were developed by one

00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,779
individual person and are still being

00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,459
heavily relied on

00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:37,160
there's loads of software in pretty much

00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:38,899
every Linux stack that most software

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,509
people will not recognize because it's

00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:44,629
too low down but it's absolutely crucial

00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:47,720
to everything else that sits on top of

00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:49,970
it so success is not necessarily what

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,639
people are saying with their their fancy

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,949
slides and one thing I definitely

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
learned over the years is that

00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:58,790
engineering takes way longer than people

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,049
think so when the market is sayo next

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,519
release is going to do this that doesn't

00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:08,119
necessarily mean it's true in spite of

00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,709
upsetting so many people I and code

00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:11,629
things are still very positive in it

00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:14,149
about a range of projects and we're

00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:16,069
actively involved in a range of things

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:20,139
so as you can see we've been sponsoring

00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:22,790
this event and I'm I was a bit less

00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:24,799
convinced yesterday but I've been I

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,509
think it's simply down to which talks

00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,309
and who you talk to in any conference

00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,660
and I've had a very positive dated

00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:33,819
Everland learned quite a lot of things

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,819
I'm actually glad very glad that I came

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,250
the two witches that we're still

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,199
scratching and I will mention this

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:45,089
mainly because it's it's not that we're

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,920
trying to kind of cult it cultivate

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,300
branding around it it's trying to get

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,160
people to understand that we're not just

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,720
doing this for whimsy if we're going to

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,879
rely on software to the level that

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,029
everybody is because most of you drive

00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,529
and most you get into airplanes and get

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,269
on trains and all that kind of stuff I

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,879
don't care so much about the games on

00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:09,129
your phone and I've given up on the

00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:13,120
privacy thing because we're all screwed

00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:14,829
for that but I do believe that we need

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,449
to know what software is running in the

00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:18,370
devices that we that actually matter to

00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:20,680
our lives and to our community's lives

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,639
and our children's lives so build stream

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,290
is part of a multi-year activity that we

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,319
and others have been involved in trying

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,360
to get to completely guaranteed custom

00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:33,519
systems where we can be sure that this

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,410
is what's in the system so it may sound

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,060
a bit like the reproducible builds

00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,040
project and certainly we're very

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,750
interested in that work also but trying

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,519
to describe a complete system and know

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:46,420
for sure that that is what is landing on

00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,519
an ongoing basis forever is is a crucial

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,290
thing for us and then the trust a bill

00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:55,480
if softer engineering in itself is a big

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:57,129
topic for me I do not trust NPM or gems

00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,209
or any of the package managers and I

00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:02,649
don't trust docker images you it's kind

00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:04,510
of naive to be installing all of that

00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:06,669
stuff and then thinking you've got a

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,100
safe production system so one of the

00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:11,049
areas that I'm trying to drive and trust

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,659
of all is is certainly something I'm

00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:15,850
personally nailed to so if and when it

00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:18,970
fails it'll be me failing again in

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,620
public I'm trying to get more people to

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,780
understand that we do need to understand

00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,380
fully where software comes from who

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,510
wrote it

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,080
why they wrote it how it was reviewed

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:31,330
how it was tested the whole works sort

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,270
of a full supply chain for all of the

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:37,659
Foss software that we are going to be

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:41,039
increasingly rely on relying on so

00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:41,039
that's it thank you very much indeed

00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:48,240
[Music]

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,130
yeah thank you to Paul sure but we still

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,770
have a couple of minutes anyone has

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:57,090
questions before breaking to the coffee

00:17:52,770 --> 00:18:08,720
break no no questions may be over there

00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:11,070
is one suddenly I understand that the

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,200
Aeronautics industry developed software

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,490
in a very different I'm sorry I can't

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,290
quite hear can we get him turned up

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,570
please

00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:20,280
sorry he's still gonna I understand that

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,710
the Aeronautics industry develops

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,100
software in a very different context yes

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,050
can you comment yes I believe that

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,300
overall historically the Aeronautics

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,690
industry has done pretty well at

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,770
software but they achieve that by

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,390
methods which are relatively labor

00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,780
intensive so there's a lot of paperwork

00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:41,850
and it's relatively expensive to do and

00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,650
they are also coming up against some of

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,840
the same things that automotive is

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,580
hitting so one their devices are

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,010
increasingly connected which means they

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,650
are at risk and to the pressure on their

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:55,530
costs is much more significant than it

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,450
than it has used to be so there I think

00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,310
there's a clear need for more automation

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,930
of how they do their validation and

00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,910
their review and all of that kind of

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,800
process and we've had interesting

00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:08,430
discussions with parties in those

00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,820
industries around that so all I would

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,770
say is yes they're relatively good but

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:16,470
arguably some of their constraints have

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:18,620
been less than other industries and I

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,780
think it's gonna get worse it you know

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,850
I've said elsewhere that until more

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:28,290
people start dying as a result of direct

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:29,880
software mistakes the the governments

00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,860
around the world are corrington aren't

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,760
going to raise the bar enough but I

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,710
think that's going to happen over the

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,260
next five years I'm very confident it

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:42,860
will be much more regulation of all

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,860
software okay thanks very much

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,020
