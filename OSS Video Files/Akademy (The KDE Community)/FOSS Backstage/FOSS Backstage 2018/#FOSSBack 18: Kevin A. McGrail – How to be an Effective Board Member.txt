	Being an effective board member takes practice. As an executive officer at the Apache Foundation, the Chair of the Apache SpamAssassin Committee, a founder at POAC-NoVA (the largest autism support group in Northern Virginia), the cofounder of 4 start-ups, advisor to 2 firms and CEO of my own firm I’ve learned a few tricks along the way.

well I won't go down all of these items

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,610
but this is what we're to discuss today

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,860
and I wanted to make sure the slides

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,930
were later on covered it but for those

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,450
of you don't know me you know I go by my

00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,130
initials cam I worked on the Apache

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,990
spamassassin project for the last two

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,630
decades and I particularly love this

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,380
picture because basically I'm off-brand

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,080
Canadian spam apparently so alright

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,430
first disclaimer you know I sit on a lot

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,189
of boards I do a lot of different work

00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,320
and this talk is not specifically about

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,239
the ASF though I'm here on behalf the

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,010
ASF where I work as an executive officer

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,399
so alright so first rule for being on a

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,190
board member and being effective so

00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,170
being on a board is a great way to

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,359
improve your pay rate great career move

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,670
and so part of the reason that I think

00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,039
people can really benefit from these

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,339
tips that I've gained over you know 25

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,319
years is start with a volunteer board

00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:03,299
and that will get you the experience you

00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:05,400
need how to be an effective board member

00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,200
to work up to it in a career level

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,220
because that's really how you can take

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,690
your career to the highest level so tip

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,940
number one learn from other people's

00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:18,180
mistakes one of my favorite books and

00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:21,420
it's actually been rediscovered recently

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,770
it's getting more press in business

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,360
colleges and whatnot but it's the

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,330
Dilbert principle written by Scott Adams

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,150
same guy who writes the comic strips but

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,980
basically what he's done is in his is in

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,290
his work and doing the comic strips

00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,540
people would write him stories about how

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,730
many dumb things occurred at their

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,440
companies and he took all of the

00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,090
knowledge and basically condensed it

00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,680
down along with his own experience and

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,600
produced a business book about

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,200
management principles and I really

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,780
highly recommend it so alright business

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,230
is like a marriage so this is something

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,780
I try and really drive home for people

00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,920
who are on a board you have to pick your

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,470
board you have to pick the people that

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,090
are on it very carefully pick your

00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,770
partner's carefully on the board

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,659
don't pick multiple partners for a

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,420
marriage that will definitely not not

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,480
work but the thing that I often say is

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,310
that if 50% of marriages fail you can

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,739
imagine how many businesses fail and how

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,310
many boards fail to be effective is it's

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,830
quite a bit

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,180
higher so set things up for the fact

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,160
that you need tiebreakers you need

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,260
people who are good at debate and good

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,180
at discussion so that it doesn't become

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,250
the you know an onerous bad task one of

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,989
my favorite things for meetings I will

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,959
not attend an immediate without an

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,760
agenda and it's a great tip now you can

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,180
write an agenda for me that literally

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,540
says this meeting has no agenda you know

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,030
that is acceptable to me but by having

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,050
an agenda you really can streamline the

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,180
meeting people know what to expect

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,840
people show up prepared for the meeting

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,370
and you know part of that preparation is

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,739
when of the meeting is going to occur

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,810
and one of the biggest tips that I give

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,540
for nonprofits and for corporations

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,580
alike is don't try and meet everybody's

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,989
schedule if you try and go through your

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,370
calendars and say oh I can meet it

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,440
Monday at noon no that doesn't work for

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,239
me Tuesday at 9:00 how's that it doesn't

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,700
work just pick something often you know

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,489
noon on every third Wednesday of the

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,019
month things like that set times it will

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,450
work its way out people will be able to

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:25,170
set it ahead a set aside the time and it

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,600
works on a long-term basis and when you

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,730
do that keep and review the minutes from

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,940
the last meeting but minutes are really

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,400
important to who made a decision who is

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,850
attending it doesn't have to be really

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,200
onerous but it really helps especially

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,209
with some of the things we're going to

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,650
talk about which are things like passing

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,299
the baton and getting other people in

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,190
there so that they can figure out who

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,200
made the decision who oh who ran that

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,940
conference three years ago oh I know who

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,920
to go talk to and ask them a question

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,739
about it the little things in there can

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,230
really pay off later on and it also

00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,910
gives you an opportunity to record

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,280
action items who's taking care of stuff

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,389
so it's in there so people before the

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,950
next meeting because you've got an

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:07,139
agenda and you've got a set time they

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,459
can look at it and go oh crap I forgot

00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,380
I'm supposed to take care of that issue

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,760
that I didn't do and they can get it

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,840
done they get it's basically the

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,729
homework assignments next mailing lists

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,950
you know using mailing lists correctly

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:21,840
so at the ASF you know we talked about

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,639
the fact that we're we're a meritocracy

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,250
some people tongue-in-cheek call some

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,930
may-lah cracy talking both about the

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,280
male domination and the IT field but

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,080
also about the fact that we want to do

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,570
everything on a mailing

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,340
they're great they're really really good

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,290
for things like planning they're great

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,270
for records I send all the after reports

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,889
etc they're not always so great for

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,200
discussions sometimes you get asked the

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,540
same question 72 times it becomes very

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,760
very frustrating when that happens but

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,919
one of the biggest things that I like to

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,410
bring up is the fact that email as a

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,100
medium as a way to communicate is very

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,470
very cold and there's a great article

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,980
that came out in Wired and I think this

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,870
came out yeah 2006 so what this article

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,370
basically did is it went over a

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,710
psychology report from a well-respected

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,919
journal and what it talks about is the

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,270
fact that 50-50 chance of what was the

00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,310
tone of the person who wrote the email

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,870
so basically you you can roll dice you

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,430
know it's a flip of the coin as to

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,380
whether or not you know what that

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,360
person's tone was when they email was

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,979
written were they angry were they happy

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,740
where they you know you're just guessing

00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:29,100
so you can't really ever read into

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,690
anybody's tone but the interesting thing

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,790
about this study that it also had was

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,280
that people thought and I think it was a

00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,690
T know 90% of the time 90% of the time

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,970
people thought they knew the tone of the

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,729
email but only 50% of the time they were

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,460
right so really great article take a

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,960
look at it all right this one is one

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,200
that unfortunately shows my age a little

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,479
bit this was a great topic that was used

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,919
a long time ago back in like 1994 I

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,070
think was when it was first really kind

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,479
of shaped up actually on Usenet for

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,870
anybody hold enough to remember us-- net

00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,970
this came out of the forums for the

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,710
dating forms like rec dating I think is

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,560
whatever I came from but the the acronym

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,410
was you know DNF tec you know do not

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,669
feed the energy creature and so this is

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,500
something you have to realize there are

00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:16,350
people that feed off of other people's

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,700
energy and one of my favorite examples

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,229
about this he's a good friend and he's

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,729
he's learned he's not as much of a jerk

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:23,010
as he was when he was younger but

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,690
imagine if you will he would log on to a

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,940
religious board and just post something

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,210
like there is no God and then log out

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,669
and never log on ever again knowing that

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,410
that just does there's like 5,000

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,440
threads that started in responses that

00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,909
came out of his work so be careful of

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,860
that don't feed into people's energy

00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:42,060
think about when you're responding to

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,380
something like that you know is it worth

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,680
the battle is it worth what they're

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,940
doing are they trying to

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,840
you've something or are they just

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:52,570
feeding off energy all right streamline

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,729
your meetings so the Apache foundation

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,009
is a really great example of how to

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,169
streamline your meetings we have you

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:00,850
know set agendas we have set dates and

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,430
times we've had the same date and time I

00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,870
think for close to 20 years now

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,669
but on top of that we have some great

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,259
tooling that's built on top of revision

00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:11,289
controlling systems

00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:13,270
it's called whimsy and whimsy Apache org

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:15,310
is the project it's one of our top level

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,810
projects and we're looking for other

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,580
organizations that want to use it but

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,410
it's basically how we do all over

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,380
reports how our chair runs the meeting

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:27,190
and everything and anything so at Apache

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,840
if you ask how do I do XYZ a good fount

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,990
of the time the answer is go to whimsy

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,580
and it's taken care of there so you know

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,949
what lets you use shared agendas you

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,930
don't have to use windy to do that but

00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:40,060
on top of that you can keep shared notes

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,050
and minutes these techniques and we'll

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,270
talk about some of the other ways you

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,520
can use it you achieve this besides

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,460
whimsy but you know they're important

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,190
tasks all right I'll take a little break

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,130
for a moment so I have some quizzes how

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,740
many people are old enough to remember

00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:59,349
emoticons that predated emojis anyway

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:06,270
okay all right anybody anybody want to

00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:06,270
guess what this one is this is a cat

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:17,740
this one same cat after getting run over

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:20,680
by a car okay this one this is me in a

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:26,199
tie so if you turn sideways it's easier

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:28,060
so don't hurt your neck cat all right so

00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,380
the next thing I really try and focus on

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,000
and this is something that sometimes

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,039
surprises people that are joining a

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,070
board a lot is general corporate

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,979
oversight and so some people don't know

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,539
the concept of a corporate veil but if

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,490
you think about it like why does a

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,470
corporation exist why don't we for

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,700
example just start doing business

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,190
without bothering with this

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,800
incorporation and all this other process

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,600
well basically the the concept behind it

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,970
is that you're creating an entity so

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,470
that you're protected personally so what

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,890
the company does and what you do aren't

00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,240
necessarily the same thing

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,880
and that's called a corporate veil veil

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,529
or a corporate umbrella and so there's a

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,600
link on this and the slides will be up

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:08,120
on the website but it talks about how to

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,470
protect yourself how to not get you know

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,269
how did not pierce the corporate veil

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,550
how to not get yourself in trouble for

00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,470
something your company does and there's

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,350
some basic things on this for example

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,790
like business 101 when you start a

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,350
business they'll tell you every time you

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,790
sign a contractor you sign any piece of

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,190
paper it's signed with your your

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,350
signature your name and your title and

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,610
the title makes it say you're signing on

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,110
behalf of the company and that means

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,450
you're signing on behalf of that entity

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,769
that you set up it's a very important

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,360
concept that people have to understand

00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,610
because that's when things like

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,890
insurance mechanisms and things like

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,720
directors and officers insurance can

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,850
protect you if you sign it personally

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,160
you need personal insurance not the

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,870
corporate insurance but on top of that

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,339
some of the things you can do in the US

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,350
for example you can add what's called a

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,300
director as an officers writer so if

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,829
you're doing nonprofit work you can add

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,950
a rider to your home insurance quite

00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:00,140
often that will protect you on some of

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,209
these cases and if there's a lawsuit on

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,860
things like that

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:06,050
additionally something that catches a

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,519
lot of people by surprise especially in

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,709
the current era of things like gdpr

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,720
they're very surprised to find out that

00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,040
officer and director and employee

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,570
information especially highly

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,089
compensated employees is public

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,410
information so people don't always like

00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:19,820
that they're very surprised to find out

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,890
that oh they go search their name on the

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,860
internet and up come some various tax

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,269
documents for various countries so that

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,130
catches some people by surprise and

00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,140
finally and this is something I'm very

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,420
strong about a CEO ID it 2 stands for

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,149
conflict of interest disclosure you know

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,459
and refusals is when you basically don't

00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,990
vote on something I don't always require

00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:41,180
that people recuse themselves from a

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:44,089
vote especially if they have gone to the

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,260
extra trouble of announcing their

00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:47,240
conflicts of interest

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,430
everybody has conflicts of interest it's

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,199
really comes down to how they're handled

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,269
whether they acknowledge they exist and

00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:55,660
how they make sure that they aren't

00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:58,149
interfering with their decision so

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,670
pretty good important stuff all right

00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:03,079
debate so one of my favorite quotes with

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,610
being on a board is for Martin Luther

00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,870
King jr. and it basically just says

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,850
agree to disagree without being

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,380
disagreeable you're not going to

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,990
convince everybody everybody is

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,860
different and can

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,089
really isn't always possible and so at

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,250
the end of the day sometimes you just

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,529
have to agree that you're not going to

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,720
come to a consensus and you move on and

00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,580
the second part of that is really kind

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,890
of pick your battles if it's something

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,690
silly you know try and keep some

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:31,149
distance from the issue at hand you know

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,730
if it's a silly minor issue let the

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,589
debate die down go with the consensus

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,450
honor the will of the board and the

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:39,279
other people who voted on it and and let

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,770
it go if it's something bigger that you

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,990
feel strongly about you know use that as

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:47,110
a time to battle and if you do that

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,640
you'll have more you'll have more

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,750
understanding from the board when all of

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,040
a sudden you really start to fight

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,810
something because they'll understand

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,070
that oh you know you don't normally make

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,779
a big deal and you're making a big deal

00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,250
about this perhaps we should take a

00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:00,000
second and rethink what we've just

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:03,100
decided on all right

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,250
transparency succession and ink so

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,800
really these these three tenants they

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,080
kind of go together and the reason they

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,790
do is that especially on a non-profit

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,459
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,740
volunteerism and burnout but you need to

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,060
plan for your the succession who's going

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,190
to pick up the baton after you and

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,480
there's a great presentation from last

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,020
year that's linked down at the bottom

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,760
that was about passing the baton but if

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,950
you share everything if you write stuff

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,230
down if you start before you even do a

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,510
task by writing the policy or writing

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,130
the SOP standard operating procedure for

00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,779
how you're going to do that task it

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,029
makes the next person who does that task

00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,550
do it better it also you know I find it

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,860
helps me a lot many years ago I was

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,880
lucky I had a friend of mine who you

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,130
know pointed out to me when I was

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,980
forgetting some stuff a Chinese proverb

00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,480
and it basically says the faintest ink

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,810
is better than the brightest memory and

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,640
you know the the much simpler version is

00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,500
just write down you won't forget it

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,420
it's right in front of you and it helps

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,450
so month to month you can make things

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,430
happen so one of the tools that I use

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,320
and I really like is Google Docs Google

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,120
sheets it's a great way to do things

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,620
like agendas and minutes and planning

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,750
documents if you have never used these

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,300
tools their power isn't necessarily

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,070
their amazing organization and

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,290
formatting things things like Microsoft

00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,850
Word are amazing for that but the fact

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,310
that multiple people can work on the

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,880
document at the same exact time you end

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,650
up with

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,090
having an agenda prepared beforehand

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,890
everybody can look at it you do the

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,270
minutes in real time during the meeting

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,310
everybody can read them see if there's

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,200
errors etc and when you're done with the

00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,780
meeting your minutes are done there's no

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,730
extra work for a secretary to go back

00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,500
and organize the minutes send them out

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,560
with an email your meetings done you

00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,990
have your records everything's good

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,160
alright good chairs this is probably one

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,440
of the biggest things that I like to

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,790
point out pick your chairs and think

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,650
about how they do it they need to be

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:57,010
somebody who's organized they need to be

00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,510
fairly strong because they need to they

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,820
need to set discussion limits and that

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,230
can be both minimums and maximums they

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,630
need to try and encourage everybody to

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,950
talk about a topic they need to stop

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,190
people from talking about a topic

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:11,260
sometimes and you know get to a certain

00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,420
point where decisions can be made and

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,700
that's the strength of a good chair is

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,110
to try and keep discussion going but

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,120
remember when we talked about conflicts

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,830
of it just interest disclosure there's

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,900
little things that chairs should do that

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,570
aren't always done for example a chair

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,550
as a general rule should not vote or if

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:31,020
they do vote they should vote last so

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:34,120
that they are not in they are not

00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,760
influencing other people's vote unfairly

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,890
so the other thing I like to make sure

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,470
if the people avoid parliamentarian tip

00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:44,260
tricks at the ASF Robert's Rules of

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,480
Order is kind of a bad word that's how a

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,650
lot of organizations run try and stay

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,290
away from it if you're using too much

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,060
parliamentarian tricks or you know point

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,170
of orders it's probably not a very

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,910
successful meeting it's probably not

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,520
going to be very fun it gets kind of old

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,380
after a while all right and then the

00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,390
rule by consensus we already kind of

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,070
talked about a little bit promote

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:06,750
inclusion so this is kind of my big

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:11,410
topic for the last year after a fairly

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:13,840
you know unwelcome suggestion that women

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,630
weren't you know capable of working in

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,730
IT because of biological differences we

00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,520
wanted to really focus on the fact that

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,070
at the the ASF we build on a concept

00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,320
called meritocracy and you earn merit

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,550
based on the fact that you know how to

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,290
do something and it doesn't have

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,290
anything to do with age sex religion

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,330
country of origin sexual preference you

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,730
know socioeconomic status et cetera and

00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,710
so you know that's one of the things we

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,810
do really hard to promote

00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,690
is promoting inclusion but on top of

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,940
that we promote diversity and I saw this

00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,070
quote recently on LinkedIn and it really

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,400
struck home that you know if you're in a

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,900
life raft and you know do you want

00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,990
everybody in that life raft to have the

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:58,030
exact same skills you do and hopefully

00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,830
the answer is no you don't and you know

00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,900
I point out that you know when you watch

00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,400
shows like Survivor where they put

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,850
people on an island it's usually like

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,830
this

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,810
mess of people having all these

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,460
conflicts and everything like that and

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,380
you know I compare it to like if you

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,880
know if they took the US Marines and put

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,440
them on Survivor by day three they

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,440
probably have a still running and have

00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,240
built three buildings and you know etc

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,610
have an airstrip going in by day five so

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,710
yeah the point is is that they they

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,000
purposely look at skills and you look at

00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,420
something like survivor they purposely

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,660
pick people with clashing skill sets or

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,700
clashing ideologies etc but at the end

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,990
of the day many hands make light work so

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,790
try and get other people to help and

00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,660
promote people with skills other than

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:42,430
what you have so one of the jokes I like

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,140
to bring up a lot is one of my weird

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,210
skills that's on my resume that my son

00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,730
asked me to add to a conference a couple

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:51,550
of weeks ago is I have worked as a

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,770
professional livestock painter you know

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,350
at Virginia Tech we got this idea that

00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,870
we'd go out and tip cows it's not

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,810
possible so we instead got back a couple

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,490
of weeks later and decided to paint cows

00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,860
we started painting Virginia Tech logos

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,540
on it and a rival University to us is

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,020
the University of Virginia so we painted

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,310
things such as UVA sucks on the Cal's

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,040
one day we were getting chased off by

00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,970
the farmer there and he says stop stop

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,070
stop and were like we're sorry we

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,330
painted your cow and he said no no I

00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,770
don't care about that he's like I want

00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,120
to hire you to paint more cows because

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:26,230
we got like a hundred bucks extra at

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,180
auction for the cows you painted so and

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,250
I threw this dog thing in there for rich

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,960
so that's an Apache helicopter so

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,400
eventually if we get big enough and we

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,030
buy an Apache helicopter I can be the

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,880
one to paint the logo on it for him so

00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:41,800
alright JFDI so this is an acronym that

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,510
some people might be familiar with but

00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,150
basically it's just do it if

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,800
you're on a non a non-profit board many

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,620
times the biggest thing you can do is

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,360
step up to do something you know

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,860
especially at the ASF

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,450
we want people to step up we want to

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,770
give them room to explore and do what

00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,390
they're doing hopefully with some

00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,850
mentorship and some guidance on how to

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,590
do it some limits because one of the

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,090
things I say is there's three kinds of

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,410
people there's people with there's

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,270
people with ideas there's people with

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,679
ideas they want you to implement and

00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,170
then there's people with ideas that they

00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,610
want to implement and pretty much the

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,980
people with that they want other people

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,230
to implement they suck so if you have an

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,990
idea step up one of the things I talk

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,970
about it is ask for delegation ask for I

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,190
want to do this I need a budget to do

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,500
this I want permission to do this and on

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,540
top of that you know ask to be the

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,910
person who reports to the board so now

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,200
you've got delegation you've got a task

00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,100
you've got a budget you can make

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,520
something happen

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,750
all right volunteer burnout so I won't

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,309
talk too much about this but it is

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,510
something to realize especially in the

00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:41,940
volunteer world especially at an

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,200
open-source conference like this

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,990
volunteer burnout is a real thing it

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,400
happens and there's ways to fix it think

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,500
about things like consecutive term

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,910
limits think about making sure you're

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,100
sharing and delegating things and

00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,900
probably the biggest thing that I tell

00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,669
people to do is admit when there's a

00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,230
problem early if you're running

00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,820
something like a conference and you wait

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,440
till three days before the conference to

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,120
tell people that hey you were too ill to

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,280
do something or just you couldn't get it

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,840
done there's nothing anybody else can do

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,429
to help if you asked it three months

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,140
later earlier excuse me and you say look

00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:13,630
I'm just I'm having a lot of problems I

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,730
can't take care of this I need help the

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,740
problems can be fixed and we're all

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,169
human we all have problems you know so

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,470
just step up and do that again some more

00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:26,350
items there on that link there below as

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,720
well some more ideas for that my last

00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,480
topic for today really is about

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,190
communication so you know especially

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,600
with email we talked about this a lot at

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,280
the ASF you know when when people

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,549
misunderstand what you're doing we work

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,880
around the world and so you know I said

00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:44,429
you know do what I say not what I do you

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,330
know speak slowly it lets people

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:48,070
understand what's going on it lets

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,750
people who aren't English as a native

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,090
speaker or your particular language

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,340
understand things and there's some ideas

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,530
here about you know you know taming the

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,419
steamroller how not to just talk over

00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,790
people and what's going on and also just

00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:03,429
you know a wonderful site that in a

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,020
German native sent me that just how they

00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:06,220
can find out things technically that are

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,260
translated between

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,480
in English and understand them you know

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,070
those idioms that we all unfortunately

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,220
use that aren't understood

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,600
internationally all the time which kind

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,679
of leads to some of the other problems

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,360
that I've learned over the years that

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:26,260
you know for example in in the u.s. if

00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,059
we use the term table and item I it took

00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,789
me many years to find out that that is

00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:33,490
180 degrees from what people across the

00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:35,740
pond mean when they say table an item so

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,480
in the US when we table an item

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,620
it basically means we've put it away

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,330
we're not going to deal with it this

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,120
meeting it's going to be tabled until

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,620
later down the line in Europe and

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,880
especially in England when they say they

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,380
table an item it means they're going to

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,940
put it on the table and they're going to

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,750
vote at it today that it's important

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,480
it's on the table

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,130
so just an interesting thing people

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,960
don't know what that means so you have

00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,539
to be careful on these type of you know

00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,620
regional confusions additionally a width

00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:03,909
vote the width vote is a very it's the

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:06,070
term nowadays you might be familiar with

00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:08,740
this Doodle vote that's a way of kind of

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:10,360
getting a rough consensus what's going

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,620
on like hey what what might work for

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,360
this where do we want to go to dinner

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,679
and everybody kind of says oh this works

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,870
and then you can kind of come up a whip

00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,789
vote is an actual position in the US

00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,230
Senate where they go around and kind of

00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:22,840
get an idea of like do we have enough

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:26,590
votes to make something pass same kind

00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,840
of idea an endowment at the ASF we're

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,309
working on an endowment project and it

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,990
was quite surprising to find out that

00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,159
two of our nine board members you know

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,140
some of the smartest people in the world

00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,970
had no idea what the term endowment

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,039
meant and if people here don't know what

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,750
it means it's basically when you you get

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,010
donated a specific amount of money and

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,690
you don't spend that money you only

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,940
spend the interest earned on that money

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,730
so that you can have a long term

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,460
investment for the the sustainment of

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,169
the organization and then one of my

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,059
favorite ones really that I think fit

00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:57,100
for this conference was you know the

00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:58,840
famous quote with John F Kennedy which

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,789
is somewhat done but you basically said

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,679
something to the extent of I am a jelly

00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:04,840
doughnut you know with dick Ben Berliner

00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:07,090
because in Berlin and I'm not even gonna

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,220
try and pronounce that correctly you

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:12,159
know that's their name for their jelly

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,049
doughnut is that PFA and then words but

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,700
you know there can be even minor

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,590
