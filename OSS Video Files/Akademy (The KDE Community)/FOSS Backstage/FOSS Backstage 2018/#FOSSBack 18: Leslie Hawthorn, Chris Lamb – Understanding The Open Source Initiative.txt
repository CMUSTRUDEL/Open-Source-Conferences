Title: #FOSSBack 18: Leslie Hawthorn, Chris Lamb â€“ Understanding The Open Source Initiative
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	The Open Source Initiative was founded in 1998 by some of the same people who had started the Open Source movement a little beforehand. It quickly established itself as the nexus for reviewing new licenses and identifying the ones that satisfied the Open Source Definition. This role standardising licenses proved to be the crucial catalyst that converted the pre-existing free software movement from academia to global corporate adoption.

In this talk we will consider:
- Briefly, a timeline of the Open Source movement
- How the license review process works and OSI's role as "Speaker of the House" rather than as "Supreme Dictator".
- The new membership system and why your project should become an Affiliate
- Some of the new working groups and activities
- OSI is newly revitalised and relevant - this talk is your gateway to understanding how and why.

good morning everyone thank you so much

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,110
for coming today my name is Leslie

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,860
Hawthorne and this is my name is Chris

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,379
alone excellent so I have the honor of

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,330
being a former board director of the

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,259
open source and a ship and I have the

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,169
honor of being a member the board yes

00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:26,970
excellent so we are here today to talk a

00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:30,749
little bit about what the open source

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,730
initiative is some of the history of the

00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:34,620
open source software movement as seen

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,470
through the lens of the OSI involvement

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,900
and historical interest and how things

00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,820
are evolved to tell you about the OS

00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,920
eyes mission and how that is relevant to

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,440
you as folks who are engaged in the open

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,350
source software community and to talk a

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,060
little bit about software licensing and

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,650
some of the legal bits so if you're here

00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:57,870
for community or for law you're in the

00:00:52,650 --> 00:01:00,660
right place so without further ado may

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,600
be some ado maybe the other one hit the

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,129
other one okay OOP it totally worked so

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,439
how many folks in the audience are

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,359
familiar with the open source initiative

00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,649
ok so I see several hands that's great

00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,659
for those folks who are not familiar

00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:14,549
with the open source initiative which

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,609
I'm just going to now call OSI because

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:21,119
it is shorter the open source the OSI is

00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,770
a nonprofit organization it is a

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,819
nonprofit organization incorporated

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,600
according to the laws of the United

00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,639
States and the mission of the OSI is to

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,600
be the steward of the open source

00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:37,109
definition so if a company or an

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,959
organization or just a person says that

00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:42,569
something is open-source it actually

00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,399
needs to be open-source as defined by

00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,429
the open source definition how many

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,659
folks know of the open source definition

00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:49,799
ok I see a few hands in the room we'll

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,039
get into that a little bit more later

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,039
but the fundamental takeaway is if a

00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:57,719
company comes along and says we we have

00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,029
this great new open-source hardware

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,770
product and there is no hardware

00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:02,819
specification there are no schematics

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,859
there is nothing available to actually

00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,329
reproduce what they have created the

00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,770
open source initiative will call upon

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,319
them kindly and let them know that they

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:14,850
are misusing the term so the idea here

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,890
is again the consumer can have faith in

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,459
whatever the producer is creating that

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,680
when it is

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,909
opensource it really actually meets the

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,739
definition of open source so the OSI in

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:28,200
addition to having individual membership

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:31,409
has a huge affiliate member program

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,049
where we partner with various free and

00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,159
open source software projects to help

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,409
them accomplish their mission in a

00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,230
variety of ways so as you can see this

00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:42,900
is like the wall of logos of folks who

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,519
have joined OSI as affiliates if your

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,230
open source project or open source

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,790
organization is interested in partnering

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,189
with the OSI so that we can be of mutual

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,629
benefit to our members that's great

00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,470
please let Krista right now and I can

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,480
get you in touch with the right folks

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,010
and he is the right folks so maybe it's

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,230
faster to go to Chris so origins Oh

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,510
before open source open source is free

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,030
software we are not going to have the

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,439
tired free versus open debate today in

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,669
fact we would like to propose something

00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:15,659
entirely different which is that these

00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:18,359
are concepts that are what do we want to

00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,950
call them not mutually exclusive right

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,840
this is yes exactly

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,120
they are friends they are in my

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,389
perspective there are two different ways

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,949
of looking at the same question so we

00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,739
may recognize these two folks on the

00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:35,479
screen mister Stallman bill joy the

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,949
creator of unix so once upon a time all

00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,680
software was what we probably today

00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:42,989
think of as open source if you purchased

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,500
a piece of hardware for example a

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,599
printer you would get a copy of the

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,699
source code that would run on that

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,500
printer and it would you know arrive to

00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,629
you printed out on you know reams of

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,000
paper because this was you know a long

00:03:54,629 --> 00:04:00,030
time ago and the great thing about that

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,769
was if people were making use of a

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,199
hardware device such as a printer and

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,759
there was a problem they could then have

00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,459
access to the source code and modify

00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,489
that source code in order to make an

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,459
improvement so the the canonical amusing

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,579
tale of this is that there was an error

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:21,539
I believe with the Xerox printers and

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:23,220
they would jam on every third page so

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,110
people would be sending print jobs to

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,580
the printer consistently and then no one

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,169
would understand why their documents

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,909
were not printing because apparently

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,020
printing has always been hard and always

00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:34,320
will be hard

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,590
so Richard Stallman had a great hack

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,940
right he thought okay well I can't fix

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,320
what's wrong with the printer hardware

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,280
this is just a failure of the hardware

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,320
but I can change the software so that

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,030
every single person who has sent a print

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,430
job into the print queue gets a

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,470
notification go check the printer and

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,240
unjam it because otherwise no one's

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,850
going to be able to print so it was a a

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,610
way to route around hardware failure

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,120
using human to human intervention

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:05,670
fantastic so then one day a new printer

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,170
comes to the office there's no source

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,850
code included but unfortunately it has

00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:12,270
the same hardware failure after every

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,670
third page at jams and mr. Stallman

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,080
wanted to again modify the software so

00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,900
that he could do this human intervention

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,170
action and because there was no source

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,730
code available this is when the free

00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,380
software movement is born right Richard

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,760
Stallman goes to the the printer vendor

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,930
I believe it was erupts and says you

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,910
know where is the source code I'd like

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,810
to make this fix and this is what he

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,370
learned about the concept of

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,160
non-disclosure agreements and the idea

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,920
that these the source code was being

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,990
kept as proprietary as a trade secret

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,030
for the company because they felt it

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,740
gave them a competitive advantage and he

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,360
felt that this was a huge violation of

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,650
the hacker ethic because people should

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,090
have the freedom to make changes to

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:56,280
their devices and to make changes to

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:58,920
software code as they see fit so this is

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,130
the definition of free software from the

00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,010
FSF so basically free software is

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,080
software that provides users with the

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,690
four freedoms our folks familiar with

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,800
the concept of the four freedoms ok I

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,460
see a few hands going up that's cool

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,770
because we have them nope right there so

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,680
the four freedoms are that you have the

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,120
right to use the software right you can

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,560
run it on your machine you can run it on

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,300
whatever machine that you choose to run

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,430
it you have the right to study the

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,800
software so you have actual you have

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,110
access to the actual source code in

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,840
order to be able to understand how the

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,280
program is working on your device and to

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,410
ensure that it is working in the way

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,260
that you expect it to and that you

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,910
intend it to work you have the freedom

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,550
to improve the software so it's not just

00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:48,330
that you have access

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,160
- this this code that is an integral

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,660
part of your daily existence you can

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,139
change it right you can make it better

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,509
for your particular use case and finally

00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,520
you have the right to share this

00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,379
software so it's not simply that you can

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,539
take it and make changes for you that

00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,150
are beneficial to you but then you can

00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,800
if you wish to share those changes back

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,720
with others so that they may make use of

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,430
it so these are the four freedoms use

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,830
study improve and share so as we all

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,550
know from eating delicious cupcakes out

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:23,340
in the foyer yesterday open source is

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,639
now 20 years old and I just want to

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,139
think the OSI sponsor adblock plus for

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,460
getting us all these awesome cupcakes

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,199
and helping the USI to celebrate his

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,940
twentieth anniversary because the

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,919
cupcakes were delicious and the cake is

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:42,780
not a lie so open source has become the

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,099
proper name for this concept of free

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,900
software and I realized what I've said

00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,240
is probably quite contentious and we'll

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:54,090
get into that in a moment but there was

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:57,150
at one point of a severe stigma against

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,949
this concept of free software because

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,009
unfortunately the English language is

00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:03,000
not nearly as exact as German which my

00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:06,479
German friends in the audience can

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,840
attest to there's no word in English

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:14,610
that means both free as in you have

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,659
freedom and free as in cost free like we

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,909
don't have two different words to

00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:20,580
describe this like we don't have cost in

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:24,000
lost and rye yeah so we had just have

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,039
free and of course as you are attempting

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,060
to create a business ecosystem and that

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,830
it depends upon the use of software as

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,300
part of your business model if you talk

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,250
to the folks in the room who are

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,440
concerned with your profit and loss

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,990
statements and tell them we want to use

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,169
free software or we want to publish free

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,120
software their immediate responses how

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,520
are we going to make money this is a

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,920
problem and and businesses were were

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,420
concerned about the idea of using free

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,529
software or developing free software

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,829
because they were concerned that this

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:57,520
was an impediment to their ability to do

00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:58,720
business and make a profit and you know

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,420
if you're engaged in business that's our

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,770
goal is to make a profit so there was a

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,810
meeting of several technologists uh I

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,420
think it was at what be eventually

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,380
became the ASEAN conference and a woman

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,500
by the name of Christine Peterson

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:17,470
suggested that it would be easier to

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,810
understand if what was known as free

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,420
software became known by the term open

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:26,020
source' right this was less threatening

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,090
to people's concept of freely modifiable

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,070
freely study of all freely exchangeable

00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:34,390
code because it didn't immediately

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:36,280
invoke this this sense of what business

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:41,350
competitive or anti business sentiments

00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:44,590
right nope where we talk about that so

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,420
open source software lets users and

00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:50,290
developers advanced software freedom at

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:53,050
work as well as in private so the idea

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,850
here is that because you have these

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,490
rights under the open source definition

00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:01,180
according to the four freedoms you can

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,200
both develop software that fits into

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,550
these specifications of the four

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,060
freedoms on your own and you can also do

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:09,670
it within the workplace so the first

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,320
decade of open-source I feel like I'm

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,700
preaching to the choir a little bit on

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,080
some of this stuff I bet all of us

00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,480
probably know about the first decade of

00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,280
open-source anybody new here new sort of

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,910
new to the free source of open source

00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:26,770
space you are totally lying but that's

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:28,450
ok we totally appreciate you so this

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,220
will perhaps be be more beneficial for

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,630
folks who watch the video later and we

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,140
are we are pleased that to have you with

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,570
us so here is a decade timeline of open

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,240
source and and it's it's a time of both

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,970
advocacy and the promoting of the idea

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,550
of open source and a time of controversy

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:48,610
right and it's this first controversy

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:51,880
arose simply over the naming right

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:54,940
naming is a very powerful thing and for

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,560
for many people they felt that the move

00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,510
away from the term free software to this

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:07,210
term open source gutted the concept that

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:10,480
source code was a type of free speech so

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:12,640
it is a way in which a developer can

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,860
express herself with complete freedom

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,350
and say whatever it is that she wishes

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,950
to say through the creation of her

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:24,250
software and you know that that like

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,630
caused a huge rift that I think is well

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,280
I think just think it's sad like I mean

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,530
now if you look at the open source

00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,120
initiative Board of Directors there's I

00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,620
think there's three board members who

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,910
are all members of the Debian project so

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,280
I don't I don't think we need to stress

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,530
their bona fides and the concept of like

00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,150
free as in freedom right but you know

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,890
for a long time this caused a great

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,240
divide and you know I think I'm think

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:47,260
we're getting past that yeah I'm hoping

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,310
so yeah so this is a fantastic timeline

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,390
which you can all read yourselves

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,870
because you know how to read and that's

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:55,560
fantastic but there's a in addition to

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:59,470
this this kind of community-based

00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:02,470
dissension there's also an era of let's

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:06,250
all perform many different lawsuits

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:08,290
because we are going to prove if our

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,030
licensing model depends upon our

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,450
business model depends upon the

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:16,480
licensing costs of proprietary software

00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:18,190
that this model for open source free

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,280
software is problematic and we are going

00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:24,190
to crush it so you have schoo suing unix

00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,840
you have the the Micra sayma statement

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,700
that linux is a cancer for microsoft

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,010
there are a whole bunch of people

00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,530
running in and in fluxing to create new

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,110
software licenses that they feel will

00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,820
fit their business model effectively and

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,060
trying to modify existing software

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,800
licenses like the GPL or you know

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,260
creation of new licenses like the apache

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,830
software license the MIT x11 license in

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:50,230
order for effectively developers to be

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:53,080
able to articulate what their

00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:56,080
expectations were for engagement around

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,120
the software that they had created so

00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,770
this is where you should chat because

00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,570
you are the licensing expert so I'm

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,120
gonna hand it over to my colleague thank

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:07,540
you absolutely yes so what what actually

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,040
made open-source licensing succeed so as

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,690
you can remember from the previous slide

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,930
there's a lot of contention and

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,850
particularly in the business space which

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,550
required some sort of crystallization of

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,670
consensus as we like to say around what

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,670
the licenses really mean like who

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:26,070
or who has sort of not control the

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:30,270
stewardship over over these over these

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,950
concepts also you know what what

00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,470
conversations can people have around

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,180
open source licenses and licensing in

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,220
general and you know it's actually

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,460
things like that and and do we want

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,900
these conversations to be sort of

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,850
top-down or do they want from a

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,190
consensus base from a community point of

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,280
view so this is perhaps captured by the

00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,950
multilateral unit unilateral divide so

00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,930
do you want a company saying this is

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,120
what a big company with a lot of power

00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,000
and money saying this is what licenses

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,340
are and what they what they mean or does

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,380
it want to be much more community basis

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,900
and well not so much community but

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:12,060
consensus basis so we can have a lot

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:14,340
more just basically review or just

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,190
people that are an agreement because I

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,500
mean the whole idea is all about sort of

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,570
shared definitions and shared working

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,730
assumptions so if you have that's a

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,870
top-down approach that's not necessarily

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:30,030
ideal so yeah my open source licenses

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:34,520
are a consensus of the norms for a

00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:37,740
community and the open source initiative

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:40,500
its main job is to be the steward and

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,290
and crystallize that consensus into one

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,020
and say you know what great you think

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:50,460
this you think that but we think that

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:52,860
the and we believe the consensus view is

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,860
that no particular open-source license

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,570
means this or the whole concept of open

00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,390
source means something quite particular

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,010
and that shared definition is basically

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:05,700
how we can all sort of rub along

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:08,720
together despite or perhaps commercial

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:11,850
differences or ideological differences

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:17,070
so the the goal of the OS sized board is

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:22,260
to approve and one of the many purposes

00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:24,960
aboard but here it is to approve the any

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,660
licenses that come on that are suggested

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,580
to us and whether they fit the open

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,290
source definition and the open source

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,410
definition has all the rights history

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,720
for all

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:39,310
right sis three to exercise the four

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,310
freedoms which Leslie outlined earlier

00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:46,069
so this is like the brief overview of

00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:48,889
that consensus in action we would

00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:52,519
receive a request to review a license

00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:54,800
under you know do SI board we have this

00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,410
license do you think it's do you think

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,069
you could approve it and the this goes

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,529
through some of the technical stages and

00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:05,959
steps that one would have to do to do

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:10,399
that if I may just add something to it

00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:12,079
so if you are a free software legal nerd

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,370
please do subscribe to the license

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,699
review list and just follow along

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:18,319
because there is and not only can you

00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:20,779
watch this process in action but there

00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:22,040
is so much legal talent that has

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,649
specialized in free and open-source

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,360
software on this list both folks who are

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,100
trained as legal professionals and

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,259
people who have done a lot of in-depth

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,389
study on their own and I think it's also

00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,879
important that folks realized that the

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:37,670
the review process is not just carried

00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,740
out by the OSI Board this list is

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:42,259
composed of people throughout the

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,790
community from various projects who

00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:48,019
comment upon ways in which the license

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,759
matches the open source definition or

00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:52,459
ways that they feel that it does not and

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,000
how it could be improved the final step

00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:57,829
is for the OSI Board to to understand

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,240
the discussion that has happened as part

00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:00,889
of the license review process and then

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,269
to provide final approval as to whether

00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,159
or not the license meets the open source

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:05,630
definition and obviously the board

00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:08,380
exercises their own judgement but

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,939
typically once the community is

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,709
satisfied that a license is compliant

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,000
the board will approve we understand

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,189
that we you know our collaborative

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,470
experts in this in this arena and then

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:20,480
you know again a new open-source license

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,730
might be born yes it's very much a

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,929
consensus based approach if there's no

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:29,120
sort of top-down King idea where okay

00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:31,159
you you you guys all think this but

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,179
we're just going to say that the this is

00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:37,820
not our Sai approach or it is improved

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:40,370
it's based on the thoughts and feelings

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,110
of the community but also from these

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,110
these legal expert experts here

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,540
an interesting point and resource

00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:57,510
doesn't have business models but

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:59,430
companies do so one other advantage of

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,400
open source licenses they isolate

00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:06,210
communities from their members business

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,980
models so this means in practice that

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,640
the RSA won't grant particular

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,680
exceptions in licenses just to fit your

00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,340
particular commercial needs I think

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,650
Leslie can speak too yeah so it's it's

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,200
so conceptually right businesses want to

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,760
be able to operate in whatever

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,200
environment that they're operating in

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,030
according to rules right this is why we

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,490
have legislation regulations etc we need

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:33,060
to know what are the rules of engagement

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:35,520
when we operate as a business and in in

00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,930
this way open-source licenses allow

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,520
businesses to when when we talk about

00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:42,960
like isolating the community like there

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,700
is a very specific way in which the

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,980
business can understand how they operate

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,240
with their software and that folks in

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,330
the community who may wish to contribute

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,100
to a project that is either sponsored

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:57,570
entirely by one company or that may be

00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,460
worked upon by multiple companies right

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,080
every single participant understands the

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,970
rules of engagement because it's

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,720
codified within the license which tells

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:09,900
you exactly how you may use study share

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,900
and I am very silly and just forgot the

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,550
fourth freedom hello Misha no I

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,040
researcher oh you do like sharing though

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:20,910
you study read and but thank you improve

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:23,640
wow I need to improve excellent so it

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:27,030
when we talk about the OSI will not

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,040
approve exceptions to your license I've

00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,810
seen any number of folks come by saying

00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,850
that they really like oh I don't know

00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,620
the Apache License but they'd like to

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,750
remove the patent indemnification clause

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,640
so we can we just have the Apache

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,470
license without indemnification clause

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,780
license please because it's better for

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,280
us when we're running our business and

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,830
the OSI simply doesn't approve these

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:50,850
changes because if you're trying to make

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:53,760
your business model workable by taking

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:56,070
an existing license and modifying it or

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,510
creating your own brand-new license that

00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,740
says this thing can be open-source but

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,059
I'm still allowed to have these

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,580
Praia Terry bits on the side and called

00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:04,080
the entire code base open source we're

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,570
not this is not something that the board

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,370
is going to do because the license

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,170
provides rules of engagement according

00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,600
to a pre-existing framework which is the

00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,860
open source definition and licenses have

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,080
to conform to that even if it's a

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,090
brand-new license so you for example

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,070
don't see like the I think the big one

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,420
was the NASA open-source license which

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,730
has been very difficult for a long time

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,960
because NASA being a scientific body

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,580
within the United States wanted to

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,990
release their software and very early in

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,220
the days the license approval process

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,830
came up with their open open-source

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,240
license which was totally okay with the

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,760
United States government to publish as

00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,780
open source so this was a huge big deal

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,760
that the United States government was

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,830
happy to give away this software under

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,690
an open-source license instead of under

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:46,050
a public domain copyright law which is

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,880
very problematic for various reasons but

00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,740
now it's very hard for people to

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,890
incorporate the software published by

00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,450
NASA into their own works because the

00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,010
NASA open-source license has all these

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,600
extra specifications that were very

00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,730
specific to that time and place where it

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,230
was created so again that we've moved

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,630
away from that as a model and now it's

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,850
very structured and very like you know

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,010
we're not going to make something with

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,480
18 million little sub variations for you

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,330
because it works well for you we're

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,860
going to fit into a framework that is

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,260
simplified streamlined and makes it very

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,830
easy for people to use and reuse what

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,420
you've created

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,730
but listen yeah I need I need my own

00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,150
license well and these have my name on

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,160
it

00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:27,690
so vanity licenses are bad I would

00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,580
suggest that instead of this we will

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,809
find a different way to make you feel

00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,410
like you are well loved and well

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,270
appreciated

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:38,400
thank you oh yes you know we're all

00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:40,080
about to live here so why did

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,020
open-source win in this first decade it

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,330
one because as less interested mentions

00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,980
reusing licences and reusing definitions

00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,230
beats reimplemented me wrote I mean

00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,960
you're just saving time right they're

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:54,210
not working out these 18 variations on

00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,429
an existing license when you basically

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,860
just want to use that existing license

00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:02,340
and again like essentially things like

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:06,510
that and you know also along those same

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,100
lines right people were very excited to

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,750
use open-source once they had a set

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,880
rules of engagement around it because

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,360
who wants to recreate the same things

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,429
over and over

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:19,170
and over again and I think if we look at

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:20,670
the pace at which technology change is

00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,020
happening from the perspective of

00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,500
software development it's entirely

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:28,620
driven by open source right suddenly

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,240
instead of having to reinvent each

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,610
component each time within a particular

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,860
group or organization people can build

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,600
upon existing building blocks to create

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,160
the final product that they're really

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,920
most interested in creating so if you

00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,410
have the lamp stack or you have the mean

00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,850
stack and you can just build it on top

00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:48,179
of that to create the thing that is your

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,710
special sauce for your company your app

00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,660
your website it's said whatever it is

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,700
that you're selling again it's much

00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,040
easier and much faster and it's because

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,660
of this you know shared body of

00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,549
knowledge and no one has to keep

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,020
reinventing the wheel absolutely and

00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:02,549
this this streamlining process of

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,559
thought means that you can just

00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:06,620
essentially just get your work done you

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,150
aren't spending weeks and weeks

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,520
negotiating what sort of license you can

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,230
just be like okay using lamp snack it's

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,240
under these shared assumptions I can

00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,679
work with other people based on that and

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,650
let's just move on let's just do

00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,309
something actually productive instead of

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,280
whiteboarding things like that

00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:25,980
absolutely

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,640
so the second decade so open-source has

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,549
grown up a bit and

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,200
so we have seen open source proliferate

00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:36,360
right but at this at this stage in its

00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,360
existence like most open-source software

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,620
instead of being out front and central a

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,240
lot of it again going back to the lamp

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,910
stack is infrastructure based right so

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,590
you know helmet you know we wouldn't see

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,240
the likes of companies like I don't know

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,309
who some of the big guys Google Facebook

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,770
Netflix or today if there wasn't this

00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:54,270
core infrastructure available as free

00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,400
and open source software because there

00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,830
is no way for any organization to

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,650
innovate and scale up to a huge number

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:03,360
of servers if they're paying you know a

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,590
per license cost for every single one of

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,520
them right that just would not have been

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:11,250
possible so again we go into this era

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,710
where the entire ability to do web

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,150
services is built upon the free and open

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,549
source software stack and a great deal

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,620
of the software that is written in order

00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:22,050
to create what was once upon a time

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,030
called the web 2.0 movement is itself

00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,250
open source or API is released under an

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,890
open copyright

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,650
um one thing that underlines the success

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,930
of open source and the the term open

00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,180
source perhaps might be that it's the

00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:38,000
word open is now being used to express

00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,610
other similar related parallel itch

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,850
concepts for example open hardware open

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:46,940
data I mean and this speaks to the power

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:50,590
of of this the stewardship and how how

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,590
names basically and really do matter

00:24:51,610 --> 00:25:00,830
license enforcement was also it was a

00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:02,840
thing it is a thing for that so a

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,820
license it's only is only valid if if

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,980
you if you comply with its conditions

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,380
pretty obviously and any and people who

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,870
violate licenses should be expected to

00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:16,510
pay some sort of cost social monetary

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,500
into compliance really right yeah

00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,540
hopefully we would ever reach that

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,880
because of this sort of consensus view

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,410
that if particular license means this

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,390
then why would you why would you go

00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,250
against that why we do enter that

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,960
community based on those shared

00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:35,540
assumptions and then not play by the

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:37,340
rules so and I think I realize this may

00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,960
be very different for folks in the

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,810
audience who are from Germany because I

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,610
was got a great education in some of the

00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,680
ways in which there's patent trolling

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,150
occurring in Germany yesterday and I

00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,730
assume the same sort of thing comes up

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:52,550
around licensed enforcement as well but

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:55,270
the idea here is for most of my

00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:58,490
experience at least is that typically

00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:01,100
companies come into compliance with an

00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,320
open-source license through through

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,540
requests through gentle education not

00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,910
necessarily through enforcement via

00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:11,750
lawsuits right so if you for example are

00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,640
engaged with people like the software

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,290
freedom Conservancy and they notice for

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,880
example that there's a GPL violation

00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:20,480
within a product that you're shipping

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,280
like they send you a polite letter and

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,690
say we notice this is a problem and we'd

00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,980
like to make sure that you folks come

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,660
into compliance and there's like a year

00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,160
or two year negotiation before there's

00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,930
ever any discussion of litigation so

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,000
more often than not people are making

00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:34,370
simple mistakes they did not set out to

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,540
be a bad actor companies don't want to

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,370
put themselves in a position where

00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,900
they're you know taking on legal risk

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,300
and liability so I

00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:44,000
there's a collaborative process to help

00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,710
people to come into compliance with the

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,200
law of the licensing I mean if anything

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:51,440
this speaks to the success I mean we've

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,790
streamlined this the adoption of free

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,680
and open-source software to a point

00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:57,170
where people are sort of accidentally

00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,180
violating and just they're oh well we

00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:02,020
didn't that wasn't intentional and what

00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,140
it was you've made it too easy for us

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:07,190
okay

00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:08,750
sorry yeah the the in the next decade

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,760
will perhaps see a bit more I mean a

00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:14,240
number of licenses require attribution

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:19,910
I think the famous example might be the

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:22,880
the artistic license which which states

00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:25,880
variously that not only must you follow

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,620
the terms but you want to sort of credit

00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,480
where this where these sort of code came

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,910
from what's the provenance of it what's

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,280
the who the original author this sort of

00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:36,740
thing and we believe in the next decade

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,320
that'll be attribution enforcement and

00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:47,390
those small angles will be more the

00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:52,790
focus than then straight up oceans and

00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:54,679
things like that once I'm going to look

00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:58,280
at you and say you're the legal guy here

00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:01,670
well a patent guy painting guy should I

00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,440
say yeah and so yes I mean just to read

00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,670
the first sentence anyway pavements

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,309
break this safe space on which

00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:09,170
open-source depends so what this means

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:10,940
in practice is that developers sort of

00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:13,040
now need permission before they can

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,870
iterate on a piece of software and

00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,730
things like that you should used to just

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,760
download the lamp stack and iterate over

00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,679
it make you a special sauce on top or as

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,050
part of or replace little bits of it

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,250
here and there and the patents and

00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:30,230
patents sort of violate this sort of

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,080
soft covenant and they they really just

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:35,380
break up break up the workflow of

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:39,320
developing free and open source software

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:42,410
and notably they must now distrust the

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:46,450
motivations of others if you you can't

00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:50,960
necessarily be sure that you have

00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:53,659
sort of the rights the the the lowercase

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,789
F freedom to to work on a piece of

00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:57,860
software if you're not sure if it might

00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:00,019
violate some patent and things like that

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,269
and people get scared and move away and

00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:08,929
so there's a sort of less innovation in

00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:10,039
general in particular spaces so you

00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:12,620
already could take this one please yeah

00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:14,240
so it was part of the the OSI history so

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,250
first there was this foot great focus on

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,399
open-source software and then at a

00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,110
certain point the the OSI Board and the

00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,669
community that had developed around the

00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,330
US I realized that there was a need to

00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:28,159
provide the same sort of guidance around

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,809
standards as we did for open source

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,360
software so there was a definition of

00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:35,029
what of what open source meant and so

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,620
what is the way in which we create a

00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:38,269
standard which we can then call an open

00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,679
standard meaning anyone can actually

00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:41,870
effectively implement this standard

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,519
there are no secrets or parts of a

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,320
standard that can only be implemented by

00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,669
one company because they feel like it is

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,649
going to be a core part of their

00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:50,929
business model and you can find this at

00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:55,039
open source org slash OS R if you are a

00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:56,809
standards geek so yes in conclusion free

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,990
software and software freedom remains

00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:02,179
the essential core of why we're all here

00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:04,610
today and pretty much most software

00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:07,070
projects and things that people are

00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,929
interested these days and open-source

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,690
itself remains a pragmatic approach to

00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:19,490
software engineering as a idea or a

00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:22,580
concept a day to day and open-source is

00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:26,320
the future I mean it's the past and it's

00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:28,370
a future and obviously today as well so

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,740
we have reached the conclusion of our

00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,029
presentation and if you folks have any

00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,190
questions we would be happy to answer

00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:36,860
them and it is also worth noting that

00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:39,200
there are several OSI board members in

00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,879
attendance at Foss backstage so one

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,639
apparently we all have to get a selfie

00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:46,700
and two there are folks around like a

00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:48,409
Lolita Sharma Denise Cooper and so you

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,879
can find any of us and feel free to ask

00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:51,200
us about the OSI we'd love to talk to

00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:52,490
you about it and why it may be worth you

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,600
joining as an individual member or

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:57,799
having your project joint as an

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,490
affiliate thank you so so so thank you

00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,040
very much

00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,030
there is a question

00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,170
I'm sorry I should have asked you if you

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:11,390
have time for questions yeah we have

00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:13,280
like 5-7 minutes cool hello

00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:17,510
I know there was an issue recently with

00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,240
zsh and a boon to basically the BSD

00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,350
license getting implemented as

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,420
compatible with the GPL and it had

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,640
something to do with a lawyer kind of

00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:29,300
being relatively loose with his

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:32,620
interpretation does the OSI have kind of

00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:35,090
cat sorry excuse me

00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,160
right up on that that's successful to

00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:41,000
sort of the casual developer to

00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:45,200
understand the nuances of that case well

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,440
there and I can't speak to the the that

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,320
case particular but I believe there is

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,960
some discussion about that I'm not sure

00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,340
there's a very nicely nuanced summary

00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:00,680
view that's yeah there's almost

00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:04,010
certainly a very long thread about our

00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:09,170
license so that's a complicated issue so

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:10,820
I mean it's not you're right just sort

00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,710
of somewhat characterize it as in a

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:17,570
liberal interpretation cetera et cetera

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:19,130
but yeah it's it's it's a complicated so

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:23,180
the OSI doesn't necessarily do like

00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:24,650
position papers or explications of the

00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,020
law just because it would be beyond the

00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,870
purview of the organization as a as a

00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,890
non-profit and you know this is when we

00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,280
all get to wave and say I am NOT a

00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,930
lawyer

00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,710
except for Richard Fontana who really is

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:38,150
a lawyer and for those kinds of

00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,760
resources like once upon a time I would

00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:42,980
look to grok law which sadly we no

00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,060
longer have available to us but if

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,010
that's the kind of thing that you're

00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,360
interested in learning more about and

00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,130
having something that's like accessible

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,240
to the casual person like explicate the

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,350
heck is going on in this like

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,220
complicated twisted thing over here I

00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,620
agree that that is an excellent

00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,080
community resource I don't think that

00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,490
the OSI based on its mission and charter

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,740
would be the the right group of folks to

00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,330
do that but what I would love to see in

00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,530
the spirit of open source if folks want

00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,090
to collaborate on something like that

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,560
that would be really cool because the

00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,510
one thing that I know about open source

00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,220
legal eagles is we don't have enough of

00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,700
them and they don't have a lot of time

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,950
to write

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,769
I don't know maybe we could do like

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:20,360
phone-a-friend ask your question and you

00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:21,830
know podcast it like I mean how bad

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,419
could that be probably get Louis via for

00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:27,080
now or we bribe him which other cakes

00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:28,399
thank you that's like really good

00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,919
suggestion Paul because that is that is

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:34,850
a resource that's missing but even with

00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:37,070
them these concepts are difficult to to

00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:40,580
condense into small things even even

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:42,019
grok law as great as it was it was

00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,539
complicated to follow because these

00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:46,370
these issues are are complicated so it

00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:49,450
may be incorrect to try and you know put

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:54,740
it down to like two bullet points

00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:56,029
any other questions folks okay great

00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,529
well thank you all for coming and I
