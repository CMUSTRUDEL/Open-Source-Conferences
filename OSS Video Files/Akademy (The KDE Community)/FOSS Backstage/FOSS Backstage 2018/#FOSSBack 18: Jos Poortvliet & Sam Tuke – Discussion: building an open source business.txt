Title: #FOSSBack 18: Jos Poortvliet & Sam Tuke â€“ Discussion: building an open source business
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Red Hat, Jenkins, phpList, NGinx, Nextcloud, Mautic, openNMS, GitLab, Collabora.

These companies have one thing in common: they are operating an open source business model. A variety of models, from charging for consulting and support to providing additional enterprise functionality in a separate edition or hosting their own software for a fee.

Each of these models has its advantages and disadvantages and we'll present those quickly, moving on then to a discussion about what works in what situation, what issues there are and what could be done better. Sharing experiences and ideas and perhaps coming up with novel solutions!

If you're part of, advising to, thinking about starting or transitioning to an organization with an open source business model, this is a good place to put your challenges to a group of peers.

Some things we'd like to discuss:
- What does and doesn't work in what situation or market
- What are common challenges and solutions
- When should you use open source and when not

	00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,470
I mean I think we should introduce

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,049
ourselves we should I suppose so

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,920
yes you're a wonderful man tell us all

00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:15,510
about you okay I'm your support Fitz

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,490
currently working as a head of marketing

00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,970
at next route where I'm also co-founder

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,710
and been around the open source for more

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,109
than a decade I mean I I know some of

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,289
you and the others I hope to get to know

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,060
and well I'm definitely interested

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,710
obviously an open source business simply

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,720
because we're running one and it is

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,550
definitely a wild ride I mean a lot of

00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,480
you probably know next route it's been

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,649
pretty crazy two years and for me

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,629
personally also hope that this

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,420
conversation will help get me some

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,600
interesting ideas and otherwise well I

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,510
hope I can share mine with others

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,460
Sam Sam for those you don't know me I

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,800
run an open source business called PHP

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,809
lists we are software as-a-service

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,640
open source email marketing platform bit

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,010
like MailChimp in the past I've worked

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,710
for collabora specifically with their

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,940
libre office online and libre office

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,710
related products

00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,660
I worked also five years for the Free

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,080
Software Foundation Europe so I've moved

00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:16,110
from non-profit to for-profit to yeah

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,220
where I am now through campaigning to

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,080
marketing to more strategic side and

00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,820
certainly off and I have and continue to

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,920
experience plenty of challenges

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,750
strategically speaking and marketing

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,990
wise with respective open source

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,420
products on a regular basis we had a

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,220
great overview of challenges faced by

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,450
elastic in the last session and I'm

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,890
looking forward to hearing the

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,780
challenges that you guys have faced and

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,720
hopefully some solutions that you found

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,140
work really well for you

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:49,470
so that's me and this format is designed

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,590
to be as participatory as possible we

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,150
can thank the frost backstage guys for

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,720
actually suggesting to us to use this in

00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,570
the first place

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,970
yes it's a first for us I know it's a

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:05,550
first for many of you but we call this

00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:07,320
the fishbowl circular almost and we will

00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:12,239
have effectively a panel discussion

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:14,939
where any of you can enter or exit as

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,590
you wish depending on what you want to

00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:17,130
contribute when something comes up that

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,100
you have

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,040
some burning content too to add we will

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,340
keep one chair free out of the six at

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,400
all times and that means that any of you

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,100
can occupy that empty seat as you wish

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,970
so you just need to get up walk over and

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,380
sit down there will be too many eyes on

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,430
the discussion so don't worry about that

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,770
and probably they'll be looking at the

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,840
back of your head in any case that

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,220
includes questions by the way so anytime

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,930
you have something to contribute at all

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,440
to the discussion you just need to get

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,120
up take a seat and either wait for a

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,310
natural break or or or fight for an

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,830
opportunity to to make your point

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,410
yes and I will be moderating during this

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,480
will be in different roles and we'll be

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,210
switching our roles at different times I

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,250
think it'll be fairly obvious hopefully

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,750
what what we're doing but your focus

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,670
will be the debate rather than what's

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:15,450
going on with us and yeah we will rotate

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:17,100
between themes so we have some hopefully

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,060
interesting questions for you that will

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:24,000
provide some stimulus for this debate to

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,970
to flow around and at a couple of points

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,830
during this panel discussion a new theme

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,170
will be introduced and at that point

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,940
we'll probably ask some or all of the

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,040
members of the panel as they are at that

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,930
point to to switch and we reserve the

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,610
right to invite people in a particular

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:43,260
points or theoretically yes so the main

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,420
rule of the model is that only the

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,090
people on the panel speak and the rest

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,800
wait do to have their say when they

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,270
manage to join the panel so when

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,920
somebody joins one of the other people

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,290
has to leave of course you're free to

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,780
choose if you I mean if you just have

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,900
one thing to add I mean you can get up

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,420
join speak your piece and leave again I

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,310
did you can leave at any time and

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,470
actually that's helpful because it helps

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,020
other people to join if there are two or

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,810
three free chairs please really consider

00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,520
joining if all six years are full and

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,350
you're sitting there please consider if

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,830
you know maybe it's time for somebody

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,720
else to say something yeah well we'll

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,370
have to see how it flows if people join

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,550
too much too little maybe we'll nudge

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:29,030
people or you know try to tell them not

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:33,490
to leave but

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:35,510
yeah we'll see how it goes good okay so

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,710
again the previous talk did a great job

00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,040
of introducing a few different models

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,600
for open source businesses we've grouped

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,780
them into three categories for

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,910
simplicity products based services based

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,280
and SAS based so these are like the kind

00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,950
of offering that the company provides

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,720
and we're gonna go into a bit more depth

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,370
now just so we have a common framework

00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,930
of language and understanding before we

00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,980
get into the panel I know different

00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,750
people have different backgrounds and

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,050
it's helpful to be able to communicate

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,840
on the same themes so product based the

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,820
product might be well generally Hardware

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,380
type products so typically this is when

00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,270
companies want to move up the the value

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,130
chain and the software is no longer

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:17,240
where they're making their profit right

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:19,400
so classic example would be IBM who

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,860
wanted to focus on their the hardware

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,830
business but they recognized that the

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,000
software side was a necessary complement

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,260
for them to be able to sell their

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,850
hardware there their server hardware

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,370
without that they just couldn't do any

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,120
business so they shared the cost that

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,720
the load by open sourcing and

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,120
incorporating existing open source

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,050
software and extending it those the kind

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,490
of hardware products we're talking about

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,620
also guitar mod is a nice example

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,140
startup based here in Berlin they make

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,430
guitar panels they sell the hardware the

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,560
software is fully open source it's a

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,150
very nice platform uses lv2 plugins

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,729
maybe some of you the Linux audio

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,820
conference last weekend maybe not catch

00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,440
it next year then we have licensing

00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,640
jewel licensing so elastic gave us a

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,350
good example of that also in the

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,750
previous talk if you were here they used

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,770
your licensing with their own custom

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,360
EULA agreement as well as the

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,130
open-source licenses that they use for

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,410
their for that yeah for the open-source

00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,660
offerings other examples of companies

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,729
are using licensing nginx Magento

00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,030
recently got acquired by Adobe for

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:23,690
roughly 1.7 billion as you may have read

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:27,260
yeah get lab MySQL own cloud not next

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,270
cloud selling binaries absolutely so

00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,190
that's kind of a convenience thing right

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,530
there are plenty of open source apps

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,550
which are on the Google Play Store and

00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:39,200
making good money revenue wise from that

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,660
collabora has also used this in the past

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,550
for some of their their desktop products

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,750
there's there's obviously there's a lot

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,100
of work that goes into making the

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,580
software behind it but the way that

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,500
that's monetized can can often be by

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,570
charging for access to the binaries the

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,990
the convenient updates the repositories

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,490
and so on creature on steam exactly

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:03,530
those are both examples of Android apps

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:05,870
right at the bottom so the second main

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,790
model of making money on open sources of

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,760
course services I mean if you have a

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,680
community of open-source developers and

00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,450
you're building a piece of open-source

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,480
together and somebody comes and says hey

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,400
I want feature X it is not terribly hard

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,050
to imagine that that person come develop

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,360
it themselves and look for somebody to

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,740
pay to do it and at which point you

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,520
basically have the beginnings of a

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,020
consulting service and of course if you

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,190
have that expertise and you put it

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,540
together and the company and you're

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,400
developing software already for other

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,770
people it's a pretty small step to say

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,480
well we can also maybe train your system

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,010
administrators to deploy the software or

00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,380
we can give a training on how to add

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,640
modules or you know other stuff and

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,920
basically you're simply sharing the

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,160
knowledge that you have as participants

00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,710
in the community the third model is a

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,240
little different from the first two it's

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,190
it's on one hand it's the same you're

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,890
simply using your expertise to support

00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,780
if you're a big company you're deploying

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,730
a piece of software that you need to

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,560
basically run your business it's

00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,000
business critical and you don't have a

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,920
support contract and the system goes

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,960
down pretty sure that this is that mean

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,730
who was responsible for deploying that

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,740
piece of software and then not getting a

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,740
support contract is well probably

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,510
looking for another job soon so one way

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,580
of putting the support offering is

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,150
usually providing job security to the

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,770
people who deployed the software and the

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,510
interesting thing and the difference

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,300
between the first two and the third is

00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,130
that the third skills in a different way

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,960
if you need to give twice as many

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,270
trainings you need to have twice as many

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,400
people giving trainings if you need to

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,289
write twice as much software for

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,479
customers as consultant you need twice

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,950
as many people actually we all know the

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,930
reality of a company is that have you

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,520
have twice as many people doing work

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,890
you've got about four times as many

00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,650
managers as overhead and your total

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,510
costs go up exponentially so these

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,340
models don't scale in a very fundamental

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,930
way if you run

00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,640
an open-source community or you're part

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,500
of an open-source community you want to

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,770
build a business around it and you want

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,720
to essentially pay people to work on the

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,520
software to improve the product use in

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,740
the end your passion is to work on this

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,040
open source project and if that is your

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,930
goal then consulting can work because

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,090
sometimes these customers pay you for

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,860
features that you perhaps would have

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,500
wanted to develop at some point anyway

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,930
and essentially by paying money they

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,040
change the priorities which is fine

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,020
which can be good

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,850
but we also all know that first of all

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,980
customers usually have no vision about

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,510
future they want a little extra button

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,920
they want to disable something they want

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,810
to add stuff that you would never want

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,230
in your product or they just want a

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:42,170
sixth encryption algorithm so this is

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,240
not great for product development and

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,860
training doesn't help you at all it

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,870
might help you grow your community but

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,540
it won't really help you make your

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,430
software better but the third one could

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,990
because if you have twice as many

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,880
customers you don't need twice as many

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,760
support people it's more like I don't

00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,580
know 10% especially if like what we do

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,050
next lads our main benefit of support is

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,450
actually you get direct access to our

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,730
engineers so yes our engineer spend a

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,890
percentage of the time on support but

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,320
that percentage is pretty low it usually

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,960
helps them fix bugs keeps them a bit in

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,330
contact with the needs of customers so

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,370
it's win-win it's not that costly and

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,140
the more customers we have the more

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,350
engineers we can hire and they do work

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,940
on the product so we do improve necks

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,920
out by getting more customers which

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,340
would not really have been the case with

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,310
the other tool so doing if you want to

00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,530
build the product you essentially need a

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,060
support model one way or another

00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,800
well let's debate that in a minute right

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,850
well let's get the next one okay so

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,880
software-as-a-service

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,380
oh I'm sorry so first services my

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,130
business model you're all very familiar

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,510
with it it's possibly more open source

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,000
new open source being created software

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,130
as a service than any other that I see

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,900
anyway at the moment again you're

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,990
familiar with it so let's move on to the

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,220
next and that's the first question and

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:06,140
now we're at the first question exactly

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:09,010
so we want your views on why we would

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,680
choose to build our business

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,209
you know on top of open source products

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,279
to start with products or services like

00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:16,600
why do it I mean a lot of this

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,730
discussions probably gonna be about the

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,130
challenges right so we need to remember

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,370
the the the motivations that we started

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,079
out with also in the previous session we

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,050
heard how successful projects like

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,329
postgrads SQL and many others exist

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,850
quite fine without having a single you

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:36,070
know commercial entity behind them so so

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,010
what are the advantages some of the

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,339
advantages might be erecting barriers to

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,019
entry for other firms so that it's less

00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:47,440
attractive for proprietary software firm

00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:49,959
to enter a market where they know that

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,570
there's already a good enough or even a

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,500
great free offering license free

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:59,290
offering other advantages might be

00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,610
access to decision-makers because if

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,399
you're in a repository it's super easy

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,829
to apt-get or yum install the software

00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,029
maybe it's a bit harder sell for a

00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:08,709
system administrator to download a

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:12,610
proprietary binary that they don't trust

00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:14,829
so much and yeah we know that with data

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,230
protection changes and also policies and

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:18,790
particularly sensitive sectors being

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,500
able to self host or just being able to

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,389
inspect the source code can be a real

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,610
differentiator maybe especially with

00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:27,100
gdpr where personally we're getting a

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,899
lot of more inquiries about moving data

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,180
to Europe for example at PHP lists

00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:35,829
because of these onerous obligations

00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:38,769
from the gdpr and yeah so why do it so

00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:41,500
who here is working for or running their

00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:45,550
own open source firm as it stands right

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:47,680
right now would be lovely if some of you

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,560
would join already and then we can start

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,839
a conversation with just going over well

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,459
the reasons why yeah your company is

00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,860
using open source exactly if you raise

00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:59,139
your hand please please take one of the

00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:04,389
five free available seats thank second

00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:06,670
yes you join yeah I will make that and

00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:08,079
the microphones so I have only two

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,760
microphones so you have to hand them

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,010
around a little bit but I think to will

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,920
speech the face we still have an empty

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:19,680
with two empty seats well face Michael

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,940
we'll see yep okay that's the trick so

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:27,630
that's the only one I think we're good

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:29,880
so guys why why did you start out well I

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:34,490
was already involved in Hadoop and had

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,780
been for quite a few years and actually

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:39,720
let me run through the story of how

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,900
harden works got founded basically our

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,600
CEO Rob Bearden was working at benchmark

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,510
capital and he was looking to invest in

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,130
a hadoop company and so he started

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,380
looking around talked to some of our

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,660
competitors I saw that they weren't

00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,590
driving the tech as much as the group of

00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:00,810
us over a yahoo and he wanted he'd done

00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,000
open source companies before and wanted

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,460
to get the people who were actually

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,820
driving the majority of the tech forward

00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:12,720
and so he actually started through the

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:15,570
negotiation between us Yahoo management

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,030
and benchmark so there was an existing

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:21,600
open source application had to write had

00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:24,150
value and had been proven and community

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,040
exactly and some of the consumers of

00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,260
that product effectively were unhappy

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,210
with the speed of development they

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,690
wanted to accelerate it actually mostly

00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:37,320
they wanted commercial support but they

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:40,920
also wanted to accelerate the direction

00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,840
so was to provide to cater to their own

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,950
needs effectively to their own

00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,830
commercial support needs

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:49,050
so exactly companies wanted someone to

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,450
call in the middle of the night if their

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,550
Hadoop cluster went down because Hadoop

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,500
of course ends up in people's production

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,320
pipelines and that's actually critical

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,240
to this whole thing is your application

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,070
has to be critical to their business

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,900
because they have to see a negative

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,940
value if their system goes down or

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:11,670
they're not going to pay for support

00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:13,170
yeah yeah there isn't there's actually

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:19,470
not much I can add to it it's it's

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:21,630
really open source is a type of way how

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:25,620
you release things right I mean it's not

00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:27,510
about it's it's not from a business

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,529
perspective it's not about doing the

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,769
right thing but

00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:34,759
it's more in providing people actually

00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:38,550
with the missing gap and that's what

00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,050
what we also do I mean campano

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,129
so you identified a katana that your

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,689
customers are missing something that

00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:44,639
that there's a something that's not

00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:46,529
being delivered something that's not

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,329
being catered to because somehow by

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,040
being open source a katana your product

00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:52,769
does something that your competition

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,529
does not what is the gap then well the

00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:57,240
gap is is specifically for us we are the

00:15:55,529 --> 00:16:00,660
only open source market back-end that

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:04,290
exists in the world so moppy in itself

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:07,350
from looking top to bottom is quite easy

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,879
but it can get very complex and we're

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,949
talking about a standard that exists now

00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,529
for 30 years of microsoft standard which

00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:15,569
is yeah sort of a standard markup sided

00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:18,480
for email exchange well it's it's not

00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:19,949
just email it's test notes whatever I

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,199
mean everything that comes from the

00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:24,540
messaging world if you imagine Microsoft

00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,930
Outlook that's that's the primary

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,029
mapping client in the world and I mean

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:33,540
this this actually comes as as a

00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:37,500
derivation or a derivative from Rafa

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:40,040
which was an open core company and we

00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,319
actually had quite some nice tenders and

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,899
we actually decided and to say you know

00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,850
what let's double down on open we didn't

00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:51,740
want to do open core anymore because it

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:55,050
also had some some downsides to it and

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:59,430
the Capano refounding also enabled us to

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,800
get rid of the proprietary bits so I

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,149
mean Microsoft Outlook is still a

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,640
dominating client in the world

00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:07,230
especially in the business world but

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,679
people are starting to realize well

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,149
there is other good stuff as well and

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,780
that's where it actually comes in the

00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:17,819
community is also a great thing because

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:22,530
you know you get suggestions and a much

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:24,059
direct much-much fluent way yeah let's

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,490
call that way so your product can

00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:29,280
improve by other people that send in

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,200
patches PRS whatever and at the same

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,880
time you get a feeling actually for

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,590
where where you want to go and the

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,630
commercial side of it this is actually

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:39,289
that you get that a little bit

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,030
reprioritize by the customers obviously

00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:43,620
but it's it's it's one world and

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,780
saw the product and told those are some

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,530
clear benefits that you get as an

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,970
open-source running an open source

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,250
project company well however we want to

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,360
describe it but it's hard to put a

00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,130
dollar value on those contributions

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,700
right I mean you can also have lead

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:01,710
customers as proprietary firm where

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,300
these the reasons why is there a fur for

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,530
example if we take one step back because

00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,930
because you're saying that your decision

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,640
within Capano to continue to be open

00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,260
sources is partly an extension of the

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,560
heritage of the firm by the sounds of

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,470
things right sort of the thing is sister

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,500
following when you when you end up with

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,780
just having the commercial side of it

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,640
you will end up having a product that is

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,190
just tailored for example for enterprise

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,800
business we have a lot of enterprise

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,350
customers ranging in six-digit user

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,480
installations but the problem is is that

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,340
they have different needs than a 50 user

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,490
installation or a 5 user installation

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,100
and our goal was to provide a software

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,990
that works for both worlds so it's very

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,550
modular it works in very tiny

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,050
you can run it on a respite because it's

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,330
a big a target market you're gonna be

00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:51,050
selling to both those those use cases is

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,310
one thing and the other thing is is that

00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,780
especially in a communications market if

00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:58,080
you have a communication solutions like

00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:01,140
we do then you need something that works

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,090
for teams also in smaller areas and also

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,550
for large ones it's a little bit a hard

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,020
thing right because the the need of a

00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,060
small customer is completely different

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,410
from an enterprise customer so with it

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,310
with the open source community you get

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:16,470
kind of for free a very broad variety of

00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,590
users and and feedback an input onto

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,030
shaping the yes the product yes yeah buy

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,890
for free I meant like not on the

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,140
individual basis but obviously there is

00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,730
a cost to supporting a community please

00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,080
we'd like to hear from you ok so my

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,830
company is called shake blue we were

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,810
100% in Apache CloudStack which is

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,190
effectively I mean I you choose these

00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,380
words carefully but we're effectively a

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,420
vendor in that in that community

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,070
we don't sell software we sell services

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,120
and in fact our journey is very similar

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,670
to that

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,040
you know the slide deck you had up there

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,140
in terms of we started as a general

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,540
consultancy I used to run a service

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,190
provider business before then and we

00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,190
were consulting helping organizations

00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,570
build their there

00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,309
infrastructures and that sort of thing

00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,350
and then we got more and more dragged

00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:01,450
into this project and over time we would

00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,889
move from consulting to training then

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,509
offering the supports because of demand

00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:06,070
exactly exactly

00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:08,019
but one really interesting thing so most

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,730
of our revenue comes from support and

00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,769
it's been a very successful business

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,149
model for us but the key bit that you

00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,919
didn't have on your slide is a lot of

00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:17,860
our customers effectively want us as a

00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:19,509
community proxy so they don't want to

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,279
get involved in the open source project

00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,840
we try to get them involved but some of

00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,789
these organizations just want to cut a

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,129
purchase order and know their software

00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:28,330
is going to work at an interface to what

00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:29,379
specifically in the community though

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,970
because they probably don't want the

00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:32,710
flame wars and so on it's it's the

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,169
access to the engineering access to the

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,799
engineering access to where the project

00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:40,210
is going in terms of you know that you

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,039
know their business is going in this

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,720
direction they want some more support

00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:46,330
around a particular technology so

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,649
somebody can you know people in the in a

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,149
provider who can actually have sort of

00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:51,490
help influence the direction of the be

00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:52,929
objective and to be frank you know they

00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,429
haven't got time to do that or the

00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:55,990
inclination to do it which makes me sad

00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:57,429
sometimes I you know I really wish some

00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,129
of our customers would get more involved

00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:01,330
in the project but that's that there's

00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:03,100
this challenges around that particular

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,409
with the Apache governance model I mean

00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,679
we've got 30 people in our organization

00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:10,269
and 22 committers in the projects we're

00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,879
sort of quite dominant within the

00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,320
project and I have to go to a lot of

00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:16,690
effort to make sure we don't get

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,879
perceived as this vendor that's trying

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,529
to do things in our own direction and

00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:22,809
the only way of doing that is to

00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:25,360
actually have you know community first

00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:26,710
ad you know a part of your interface the

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,539
community that you've got to manage

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,250
expectations both sides place a solution

00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:32,110
which sometimes makes you know the

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,610
internals of running a business

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,889
sometimes a bit of a challenge because

00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,289
you know I have PMC members who are

00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:40,179
direct reports to me at worked and

00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:43,450
sometimes we have to sort of take work

00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:44,889
hat off and put PMC hat on yeah but it's

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,070
worked and we've just fallen into that

00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:50,769
model there was no great strategy around

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,000
it we fell into this project so it

00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,850
sounds like we've got two projects

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,830
represented here who were taking an

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,690
existing open source application or

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,700
ecosystem and because of strong demand

00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,279
for that product because it was it's

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,159
proven its value you were responding to

00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,320
demand and yeah delivering services on

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,970
top in your case you

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,549
both with the Rafah and Capone who

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,320
created new products effectively they

00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:17,740
incorporated some other open-source

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,549
applications as most do but you took the

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,179
decision to actually incorporate

00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:24,130
something fresh and in your case was it

00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:26,590
an existing product or something fresh

00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,120
it's not a product so I've previously

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,640
been involved in running software

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,890
services companies multiple times and my

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,710
background was primarily proprietary

00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:39,399
software but system software hard stuff

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,769
so claiming to be great engineers okay

00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,090
when I got involved in coding I was

00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:45,279
trying to find out what the

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,320
open-source was about and I discovered

00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,179
actually the people encoding it was very

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,700
small at the time which is dramatically

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:53,740
better than the people I would typically

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,419
work with so one of the things that

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,720
actually motivates me is doing great

00:22:55,419 --> 00:23:00,010
work and to be suddenly surprised by an

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,510
organization which was working for the

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,010
same kind of companies I already had

00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,080
experience with but there people were

00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:08,740
demonstrably better change my

00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,740
perspective it's not to say that it's an

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:14,620
easy road but as a result of focusing on

00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,639
better quality engineering you say a

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,620
little bit more for people who aren't

00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:19,750
familiar with Co think so better well

00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,519
the engineering of what what we our

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,769
system software engineering specialists

00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,990
so that means one thing one of the

00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,490
things like announcer is companies call

00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,980
us when their project is completely

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,929
screwed when they've had much bigger

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,159
companies to do a custom Linux system

00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:34,779
and they've completely messed it up

00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,260
because they don't understand how

00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:40,600
upstream works how the communities work

00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:43,269
and it really does keep happening that

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,730
our customers and our competitors

00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:49,419
discover that our people look just no

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:51,760
more and that is it's not achievable

00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:53,679
without the collaboration so I came to

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,360
realize over a few years that the part

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,580
of the difference is everybody's talking

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,570
to everybody and sharing the information

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,460
getting involved in those communities

00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,320
exactly the proprietary guys are

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,510
googling and saying oh yes I'm a little

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,059
UNIX expert but they're not doing the

00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:09,130
work they're not gaining the same level

00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:11,620
of knowledge so it's it's become a clear

00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,380
differentiator for us I remain

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,149
astonished that there are so few

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,340
straight software services firms that

00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:20,350
play this card you know collaborators

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,389
one it gallier is another but in our

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,359
space there are very

00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:26,039
the organization's competing as much

00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:27,809
bigger companies that are demonstrably

00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,459
worse than us so you're again

00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:32,639
interfacing to these open-source

00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:34,049
communities and adding the experts

00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,309
you're hiring from these communities to

00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:38,849
presumably in order to get this

00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:41,989
engineering expertise interesting yeah

00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:45,839
so please and also somebody needs to

00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:47,219
vacate so an entirely different

00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,749
direction I'm not working for this

00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:52,440
company anymore but I was working for a

00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:53,940
company that was going into a market

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,759
that's already pretty sexual that's

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,669
rated and one of the strategies that the

00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:03,389
existing companies in this market was

00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:05,369
using was was vendor lock-in we have

00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:07,139
your data how are you going to get your

00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:10,079
data out of our system and into that

00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,429
system think about it you wouldn't want

00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:19,379
anything bad to happen to your lovely

00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:21,119
data right so one of the advantages that

00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:23,879
the company I was working for was using

00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,109
or as they're saying will help you solve

00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:27,239
this problem with getting your data out

00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:28,379
but once you have your data out you

00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:30,200
weren't gonna want to think about this

00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:32,489
not happening again

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,679
we promise that will give you your data

00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,849
a but that doesn't do you much good if

00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,249
you don't have a software that can

00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:40,019
operate on the data look we're open

00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:42,779
source so it actually means something

00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,089
that will give you your data so do I

00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:47,159
understand then that you were providing

00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:48,779
so this so what came out of this by the

00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,690
way that can you name the project

00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:53,729
although the product this is actually

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,649
the company was name is named Quayle app

00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:58,320
and the project has been around direct

00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:59,519
um so the value that finna act adds that

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,809
one of the key differentiators the

00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,820
benefits that it gets from being open

00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:05,249
source is that your customers know that

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,729
vendor lock-in is not so much of a

00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:11,609
threat right and so therefore you depend

00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:13,200
upon those customers understanding that

00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,940
understanding that that's valuable and

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,489
and being prepared to pay for it and

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,109
because the market is fairly old many

00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:21,929
customers have had negative experience

00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:23,940
with vendor lock-in at this point yeah

00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,190
we have exactly the same situation and

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,649
when we took our support service to

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:31,319
market we sort of promoted it as an open

00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:34,379
source you know being a fully open

00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:34,590
source around the open source product we

00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:36,960
act

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,460
she had a very large vendor in our

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,260
project at the time I won't use their

00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,669
name here because it's been recorded who

00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,190
were trying to sell her for our

00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:52,470
proprietary distribution of cloud stack

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:53,909
as well science my family and we were

00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,830
very very successful in the space

00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:57,510
because we went to the customers and

00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,520
said no this is completely open-source

00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,370
we will sit on the side and they liked

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,289
that message it did with some

00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,970
particularly sort of traditional

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,710
conservative organizations it took some

00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,020
time to get that message through because

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,370
they had vendors telling them how they

00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,070
polish everything so it shines so much

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:16,470
which wasn't always the case but I think

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,049
you know the market is coming round to

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,870
that concept of open source gives them

00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:24,029
you know a peace of mind and a long term

00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,529
organic stability to the software that

00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:27,360
they won't get from a vendor who's a

00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:28,529
roadmap is gonna flick all over it

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,330
they might leave a project and that's

00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:33,000
actually exactly what happened with with

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:36,480
a patchy cloud state do we have

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,840
experience with targeting a market which

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,529
does not understand or value the

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:47,429
differences of open source beyond these

00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:50,370
technical consumers technical decision

00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:52,620
makers system administrators who maybe

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,730
they know this product there that they

00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,440
know the projects and other community

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,740
know others need to interface but what

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,539
about maybe consumers like n you know

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:05,970
end users who are not from this line man

00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:10,100
I have an awesome story to share here we

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:12,480
provide a web application that has been

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,809
multiple times awarded it's really nice

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,140
and we also have a desktop application

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:21,539
which embodies this web application I

00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:26,010
also want to say the customer here but

00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:27,450
it's someone everyone knows and the the

00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,750
problem that we had was they were using

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:33,740
Outlook all over the place they were

00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:36,450
happy with it and then they heard okay

00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,120
we're not going to support Outlook in

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,279
that way as we did in the past and so

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,370
we're thinking of what can we do to make

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:47,600
the people actually accept it this is no

00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:50,539
joke we just replaced the icon

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,549
of our thing renamed it out look at the

00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:55,429
acceptance was really there this is the

00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:58,850
desktop or the cloud product it's a day

00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:02,120
the reality is is this don't ask a user

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:03,830
for what actually is about four Adem

00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:09,410
that was all it's a new outlook version

00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:11,360
right the reality is there's there you

00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,520
always have to make a differentiation of

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,240
what type of users you're talking to

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,880
obviously in in Hadoop world the users

00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,530
consumers are just on a completely

00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,559
different technical level exactly and

00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:28,210
the thing that we have is this is that I

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,250
mean something like email is basic right

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,110
but we all not only do that we do web

00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,080
meetings which can get more complex but

00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:38,750
the consumer wins by the effect that the

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,450
solution is still easy so our our main

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:45,289
problem is is you have to make things so

00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:48,500
stupid so so really yeah intuitive in a

00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:51,500
way that you don't have to teach the

00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:54,559
people but the the biggest challenge for

00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,650
us at least is is to get people think

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,570
about new things right so you know when

00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,669
when people log in to Google on Gmail

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,500
right they know it's a web application

00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:05,480
so the expectation management there is

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,919
is quite natural when they go into their

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,600
business and they're used to Microsoft

00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:10,520
Outlook then they expect the fat client

00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,010
which is like over freighted with all

00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,659
kinds of stuff but they don't expect web

00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,390
meetings and stuff like that sort of the

00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:19,580
fun part is is really managing these

00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,440
expectations just renamed it rebranded

00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,000
whatever in the sub brands are extremely

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,429
powerful but there are ways around them

00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,730
if the products up to par that's the

00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:31,100
lesson we can take from this ok good

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,929
we have some other questions that we

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,380
would like to put to the room is there

00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:37,610
any final point on why start an

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,340
open-source business in the first place

00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,480
that we'd like to make before we move on

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:45,950
actually wanted to make one more point

00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:48,409
which was that of course as a dev rather

00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:51,110
than a business guy I love working on

00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:53,120
open source and so making a company

00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:56,360
where we get to work on open source and

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,690
keep the whole product open across the

00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:02,430
stack and not open

00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:05,520
is really awesome right and we could

00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:09,030
perhaps say acting the talent in yeah I

00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:11,040
mean just like he was saying that people

00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:14,360
like quirky and open-source and so it

00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,320
makes it much easier to hire actually

00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:21,150
they can be part of the vision of a

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,770
product in itself right okay so thank

00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,060
you very much I think we should refresh

00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:32,900
the panel now and I'm gonna put the next

00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:36,570
question on screen thank you all right

00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:39,150
so because this is a reasonably common

00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:43,170
model we wanted to put up a couple of

00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:45,870
questions around the selling it as a

00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:49,830
support with services packets

00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:51,630
essentially selling it as a product and

00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,190
it's kind of funny to hear that one of

00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:56,850
the people on the panel actually went

00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:59,190
from consulting to training to support

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,830
because for a lot of companies at least

00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,620
the ones that I talked to that are doing

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:07,110
a support model it's very hard for them

00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,670
not to be pooled into consulting which

00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:10,620
has the downsides that I mentioned

00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:13,650
earlier at least you know perceives down

00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:16,530
size and the other problem is of course

00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:19,650
if you're trying to build an open-source

00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:22,710
business and trying to sell support

00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:25,170
using the money from that to improve the

00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:28,290
product somebody else could simply try

00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:29,820
to sell support without wasting the

00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,880
money on improving the product and

00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,260
undercutting you and well there are a

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,630
couple of other questions I'd like to

00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,270
put to the panel so if you have any

00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:41,430
thoughts on these things and if you work

00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:44,190
in organizations like any of those

00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:47,210
please join the circle and let's have a

00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,210
conversation about them

00:32:50,099 --> 00:33:01,119
at least coupon now I know you were just

00:32:52,509 --> 00:33:03,639
in the room but and I I really loved ya

00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,169
sorry I hate to put you in again but I

00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:06,639
really appreciate it

00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:08,559
I'm sure there are more consultants in

00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:12,399
the room right Sammy yeah I mean at a

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,979
conference like this you can move you

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,720
can move if you want the fresh chair

00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:19,509
right cool

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,210
yeah maybe begin with how do you avoid

00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:24,309
the trap that you know yeah I mean it's

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:29,440
it's always a risk if Sarris this one

00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:31,059
and just know it I mean it's always a

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,220
risk but what we did when we built our

00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:35,440
support offering we went to great

00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,210
lengths from experience of having run a

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,859
managed service provided before I didn't

00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,710
want to get into that business and

00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:43,629
that's why loosely use that term vendor

00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,820
we do that vendor style support so our

00:33:43,629 --> 00:33:47,289
support this is effectively full of

00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,570
engineers I think somebody else maybe

00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:52,029
made the same comments which means it

00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,099
fits very well with their day job which

00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:56,470
is committing stuff upstream and working

00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:59,320
on features and working on our project

00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:01,119
roadmap and what have you there are

00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,159
other people offering support services

00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,809
around our project but none of them do

00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:06,639
it the way we do which is basically

00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,079
you're you're logging a ticket and it's

00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:09,789
a committer dealing with it so that's

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,529
the service we we offer and I think

00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:13,869
that's a really important thing to to

00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:15,579
get right if you're going to build a

00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:18,429
business which is taking customer money

00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:19,750
to to de-risk their organization based

00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:22,869
on your technology and you're going to

00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:24,789
invest that in the technology you have

00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:28,659
to offer a support model which is going

00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:31,059
to fit what you want to do they're going

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:33,639
and offering a more tiered support model

00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:35,529
I think leaves an organization a lot

00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,149
more open so that's that risk and that's

00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:40,809
actually what some of our competitors do

00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:42,549
do in that space but I also think as

00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:44,409
well I think there isn't a single answer

00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:47,049
to any of this it depends on the project

00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:48,879
I mean we're quite lucky with Apache

00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:51,700
CloudStack because it's been around for

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,589
nine years and it's in the plateau of

00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,659
productivity nobody pays a lot of

00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:56,559
attention to which we we've hated for

00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,539
the last nine years but actually

00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,849
commercially has been great for the last

00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:02,410
few years for us because it's not like

00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,390
every take OpenStack and

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,280
turn ative every vendor Under the Sun

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,770
everybody wanted to build an open stacks

00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,289
services business five years ago nobody

00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:13,470
was watching a patchy cloud stack and

00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:15,460
from a business perspective ultimately

00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,079
that's a good thing because we don't

00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,490
have all of those those vendors but you

00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:24,369
know it depends on the project I think

00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:26,410
there isn't a single answer we were

00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:28,539
quite a few companies that are

00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,339
traditionally already open source like

00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:33,099
elastic but we were also working for

00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:35,859
some companies that's trying to adopt

00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:38,319
open source which would what we really

00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:40,150
like to stress with a lot of those

00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:42,549
companies or with those new companies

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,319
that is that they're experts in the

00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:46,000
field and that's for them is sometimes

00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:49,059
still the difficult concepts you know

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,020
then that they're best at what they do

00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:55,720
so also do seeing the real Freight you

00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:58,569
know of getting into open source because

00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,690
then what will happen to my brand you

00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:03,940
know can we really still exist as this

00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:07,119
you know what they formerly were as a

00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,710
proprietary business and I think one of

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,220
the challenges you know that I really

00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:14,260
see is that the kind of waiting until

00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,880
everything is ready what we are trying

00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,740
to do all the times you push them you

00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,770
know come on guys you can do this one

00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,930
step at a time it's not I mean we do

00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,660
have two very different kinds of clients

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:28,569
so some that are really open source are

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,099
really used to it and still you know for

00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:34,180
the for the guys you know one of the

00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:36,490
things that I also think no makes a like

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:39,250
from the first question it's what really

00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,809
makes companies go go towards open

00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,390
source is that everything else is open

00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:46,900
source so what else can you do you know

00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:49,420
then then really start with that so not

00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,760
as a competitive advantage but almost as

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,770
a well we have to otherwise yeah they're

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,750
kind of infected you know by at least

00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:58,000
the company I work with it's in open

00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,309
networking and then everything around it

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,349
is you know there's so many projects you

00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:04,240
see the next foundation really adopting

00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:06,520
open networking then they really look

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:11,440
okay there's no other choice they kind

00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:14,980
of have to open source yeah yeah so I

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,520
work for IBM which has a long and sordid

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,240
history

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,350
have a relationship with open-source

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,020
early supporters of Apache Software

00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:28,000
Foundation early supporters of Linux but

00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:29,290
also longtime sellers and of you know

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,150
db2 and other really proprietary

00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:33,040
solutions

00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:37,480
I was hired on to be an open-source

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,820
evangelist and my experience which IBM

00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,180
such a big company if anybody's watching

00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:47,730
um it could be entirely different and

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,730
these are my opinions not the companies

00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:55,420
but the goat the strategies been you

00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:57,880
know developers at really really large

00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,440
companies want to start moving to

00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,200
open-source it is just that's the way

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,150
the winds are blowing um when you get to

00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,910
the the higher level of the c-suite the

00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:10,210
the older people in the company the

00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:13,840
decision-makers they're a are hesitant

00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:17,140
to do that um I don't know I I be M has

00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,610
a lot of open source projects but

00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,390
usually aren't what we're trying to use

00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:24,970
in sell what we are selling is we can

00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:27,070
come in and look there's a huge name

00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,780
we're selling you a bunch of proprietary

00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,100
stuff we'll just work this into the

00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,980
service level agreement and we'll tack

00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,990
on some open source on the side but if

00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,000
anything ever goes wrong you can call us

00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,830
because we will throw enough money at it

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,620
to solve your problem it doesn't matter

00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:44,710
what's going you we you can't break IBM

00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,420
and our service our contract will we'll

00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:50,260
take a loss because we're not gonna let

00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,430
that happen so that's yeah it's a

00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,530
different I think angle from some of the

00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,060
smaller startups it's just a unique

00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,460
perspective I kind of wanted to toss in

00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:02,500
that it's it's it's I know it's a

00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:06,270
different tack but yeah to add to that I

00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:10,420
mean the history of Copan or roots back

00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:13,570
with Rafa and I have to admit that we

00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:17,260
also occasionally take a loss based on

00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:19,180
doing the support and I think if you if

00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:22,180
you compare especially the smaller

00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:24,190
products or the smaller projects with

00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:26,920
the larger projects or larger companies

00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,570
then you will realize that that is one

00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,260
of the differentiators why people

00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,450
actually

00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,790
choose two smaller ones this is that the

00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:37,360
support generally speaking is running

00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:39,880
really well because and that's actually

00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,070
the value that you sell it's not just

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,200
okay we can help you but it's also the

00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,810
type of to speak the type of the type of

00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,370
help right so you have a lot of

00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,680
commercial vendors which say yeah you

00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,970
have phone support or email support but

00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,570
not phone support and then there are

00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:56,430
others

00:39:52,570 --> 00:40:01,240
that's an extra right and in in general

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:04,150
I think it's it's not a bad thing at all

00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,860
to sort of let's call it commoditize an

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,580
open-source product that's actually what

00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:13,240
we do we have a product and this product

00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:15,730
is basically like sold we don't sell the

00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:18,180
software as it is obviously but because

00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:21,370
we're talking open-source here but

00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:23,830
people don't want to buy a product which

00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:26,320
just it's like when you get a car right

00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:28,810
you just take the car you're off the lot

00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,090
and then it's your deal and what we do

00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:33,460
is is they actually we give you service

00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:35,110
we whenever you break down we help you

00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:38,380
and that that's the whole idea behind of

00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:40,480
it and you have to be good at it right

00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,790
otherwise you wouldn't come back and say

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,120
hey I like this vendor I like this and

00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:48,460
that's it so that's that's the big how

00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:52,090
how can you protect it on the other hand

00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:54,850
well on cloud and X cloud to be honest

00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:57,190
was not really the best from an outer

00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,140
objective perspective what happened

00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:02,860
because that's the power of forking

00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:04,330
right but on the other hand if you know

00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,940
the backgrounds of this whole

00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:10,810
development then it was a very good

00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:13,090
decision even though it it's it

00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:15,730
generated a lot of air let's call it

00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:17,290
that way but well I think for for

00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,940
business of course one of the advantages

00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,610
of open-source that was mentioned is

00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,470
that it makes sure that the product is

00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,240
around you're not locked in of course

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:29,230
what happens with um clouds going

00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,970
bankrupt including shows that didn't

00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:35,730
matter there were even two companies

00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:37,980
after you know on cloud Inc went bust so

00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:40,109
yeah I would indeed think that it's a

00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,119
good thing but of course from an

00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:46,170
investment perspective it was perhaps a

00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:48,630
bit scary well I wanted to also say on

00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:51,869
your slide part of the way that you get

00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:54,540
people to renew the contracts is by

00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:56,580
continuing to innovate right if it's

00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,270
hard for other people to come in because

00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:02,820
as you introduce new concepts and new

00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:05,400
features into the software then they are

00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:08,460
always a step behind right so third

00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,250
parties can't come in and support your

00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,740
stuff as well as the people who did the

00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:16,230
work and there are always in catch-up

00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,420
mode and that really hurts them actually

00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:21,390
yeah and so it gives you a huge

00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,430
competitive advantage to to be the ones

00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,080
innovating the the core of the product

00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:27,780
we have someone to fill one of these

00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:30,090
chairs a lease so many MIT questions

00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,320
maybe for someone on the panel or wants

00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,540
to bring something else up otherwise

00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,770
please please come just come to the

00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,440
front even for one question please

00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:39,540
please question just sit for a minute

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:46,470
sitting is killing us all you just

00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:50,000
extended your life five seconds just ask

00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:52,440
the question no I was just interested if

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,270
the open source project or code that

00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,609
you're using to make business out of it

00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:59,130
that somehow they decided to go in a

00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:01,050
direction that you see that's

00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:04,050
contradicting or will hurt you

00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:07,260
business-wise how how you if any of you

00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:09,180
had this was a situation and how did you

00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,800
tackle it so if you have a conflict

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,390
between the community and a director

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,830
community wants to go and the company

00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,570
think it's a really good question and

00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:18,140
I'm sure there are people here who have

00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,140
answers

00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:27,030
yeah and in short words every day the

00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:28,470
the thing how we tackle it and again

00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:33,120
we're doing this for over ten years now

00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:35,550
is prioritizing please don't get the

00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,370
impression if there's a customer it

00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:40,410
automatically has higher priority than a

00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:42,750
community member that doesn't work that

00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:45,990
way the prioritization goes but effect

00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:49,170
is is how impactful is this forward for

00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:50,580
all users right so some of the the

00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:54,770
things that came along from the

00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:57,570
community are really also hurting

00:43:54,770 --> 00:44:00,000
customers so it was important to us to

00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,890
say hey this needs to get in and so the

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,290
prioritization is based more on the

00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:07,380
issue or on a bug or on the feature

00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:10,680
whatever and has nothing to do at all

00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:13,550
with a community versus company the only

00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:16,740
level that you have as a company which

00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:20,370
well you have two levels one thing is is

00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:21,960
that obviously the more important but

00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:25,710
that's natural business thing more

00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,500
important a customer is the more you're

00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:31,110
inclined to provide essentially a little

00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:33,710
bit more resources to it right so that

00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:36,360
you say hey guys we're talking here

00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:38,510
million dollar customer we really need

00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,100
to make sure that he is happy right

00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:43,350
that's one side of it but the other side

00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:46,800
of it is also and that's the great part

00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:48,660
about open source i mean you as you

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,250
mentioned you want to innovate the

00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:53,760
product because only when you innovate

00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:55,350
the product you get people to renew they

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,030
want to see that the product is moving

00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:59,010
on you want to see that support is going

00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,920
on if that all is good then they will

00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:04,110
renew and everyone is happy but there

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,230
are also customers which come in and say

00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:09,060
like I need this button and blue and you

00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,280
have your product in green and it says

00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:13,560
like this looks stupid we won't do this

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,170
I mean then he says well you know what

00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,420
we pay X ma X Y Z for it and then you

00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:21,260
say like okay you know what we can do it

00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,790
just for you in your environment and

00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,920
this is done by a completely separate

00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,810
team right so they did this is like

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,050
professional services and and so on and

00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:31,770
they'll do it for you and but don't

00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:33,960
expect us

00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:37,050
to merge this back into the core product

00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,840
because if we do so every other customer

00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,640
would say we're nuts right so that's

00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,190
that's the that's the core thing of it

00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,890
and actually this is something that is

00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:48,600
really let's call it the VIP service for

00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,490
special customers but it's really

00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,010
completely aside from the development if

00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:55,620
you mix that up you end up being a

00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:58,260
consulting company and developing your

00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:00,360
product into being a customer driven

00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,640
thing and that's absolutely not what I

00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,800
know we we partially have been there

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,090
long years ago it's not a good idea

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,560
don't do it well as always with software

00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,510
you need to listen to what your

00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,520
customers actually need not what they

00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:17,520
say they want and give them something

00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:21,240
that fits with the architecture so

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,610
absolutely your customers are critical

00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,010
for assigning your own resources but

00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:28,560
with open source projects especially the

00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:30,420
ones that you don't dominate you're

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,060
going to get other stuff coming in so of

00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:35,760
course the community provides other

00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:38,100
stuff which is a good thing and your

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,490
customers will take that and use it so

00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:43,290
you the challenge there is that you need

00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:45,450
to make the managers understand yes you

00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,280
need to rebase and spend engineering

00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:51,180
effort to get some of those new features

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:55,410
coming in you can't stay on a fork from

00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:58,260
two years ago right and so that's always

00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:01,410
a struggle but you have to pay that cost

00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,210
and convince the managers who aren't in

00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:05,970
open source right there they're just

00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:08,990
managing the company priorities that

00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:13,050
it's a critical part of what they do and

00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:16,890
so IBM who again may or may not have a

00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:20,280
great perceptions in the community all

00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:22,950
of the committers and PMC's on strategic

00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,140
projects have their own little death

00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:28,710
unit that no one can touch it's an

00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:33,300
office in San Francisco and that is to

00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:36,570
prevent anyone from having any being not

00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,520
persuaded incentivized or having the

00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:40,290
idea to even try they have their own

00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,750
management chain and no one can touch

00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:44,960
them and that and they just because we

00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:46,280
do want to contribute to the community

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,450
we want to have that isolation that

00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:52,010
firewall that's how we prevent anyone

00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:58,760
from calling in who's a big customer

00:47:52,010 --> 00:48:02,560
it's a conscience yeah I mean so that's

00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:05,180
that's another I guess just tactic for

00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,440
keeping that division of yeah I think

00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:11,150
they call it the division of church and

00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:13,220
state which this does anyone here have

00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:15,470
experience how this is in an open core

00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:17,570
company so if you have a open source

00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:19,730
product with proprietary Adams because

00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:21,440
then you can see community members who

00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,540
want to develop features that are

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,940
proprietary atoms and therefore undercut

00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:28,520
your company my life I've seen this in

00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:31,580
the past we're completely open so we

00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:34,730
don't face that part but we've dealt

00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:37,700
with projects where they're dominated by

00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:39,950
company that is open core and yeah it

00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:42,260
really sucks because when you try to put

00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:46,190
that feature in they pull push back of

00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:48,349
course and then you need to say okay

00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:51,580
well either do this on our own and in

00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:55,280
added work of fork effectively or

00:48:51,580 --> 00:49:01,220
additional work of their addition but it

00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:02,839
basically sucks Holden who is also

00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,070
running around here we were talking

00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:08,140
about this a couple years ago at an

00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:11,270
Apache gun and her solution was it was

00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:12,830
something and with I don't know it was

00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:15,589
some sort of streaming thing we I was

00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:17,450
working on and she said well then just

00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:19,460
make crazy Bob's house of streaming and

00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:21,349
just keep going on that and eventually

00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:25,490
they'll try to merge you back in and

00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:27,950
they'll take your stuff but yeah dude

00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:31,490
the reality which we could face with oh

00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:34,339
we've been open core before the thing is

00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:38,330
it hurts the product it hurt it hurts

00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:41,570
the open source part so for us we had

00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:43,580
the luck that moppy is not an intrusive

00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:47,660
technology so you really need time to

00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:50,390
get into it but therefore basically

00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:52,130
locking out others from easily forking

00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:54,800
let's go that way

00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:57,170
but the reality is is

00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,200
when you have this open core model then

00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:03,800
from a natural business perspective you

00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:05,630
try to you know to to rub the jewels

00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,430
right you you want to make them nicer

00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:09,740
and shinier and just add some more tools

00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:11,660
to it but the crown under it is is just

00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:14,950
rusting and that's exactly the problem

00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:17,630
what happens when you go open core I

00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:20,440
might add something from a different

00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:23,300
perspective we have actually given up

00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,940
producing our own products by now so

00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:28,940
we're basically I'm working for ktab so

00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:32,660
we're providing consultancy historically

00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:33,950
mainly on cute or cutie so this is where

00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,200
we're basically taking the other

00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:38,930
perspective so we have the question how

00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,300
don't we cannibalize the the cute

00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:44,930
business model because obviously we our

00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:46,730
services rely on them and and this this

00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:48,920
relationship between our company

00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:52,190
providing the the consulting we're also

00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:55,460
the second largest sort of external

00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:57,560
committer to the project so I mean this

00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,150
is the typical question our our

00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,790
customers have like we're running into

00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,530
this very serious problem here we can't

00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:08,119
solve it ourselves so please go ahead

00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:09,440
and do it and yeah this this this kind

00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:12,560
of relation from the other perspective

00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:15,800
we we do want a healthy cutie yeah

00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:18,619
because this is what we sort of live

00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,390
from but this is this is also from the

00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:22,630
other perspective it's not it's not easy

00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:25,849
we've we've tried a lot of things but

00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:27,980
it's it's like we we try to sell

00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:29,990
licenses for them because we do have

00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:35,270
customers so we try to get our share on

00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:37,430
that but that sort of start cute to fear

00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:39,080
about their business model on the other

00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:42,380
hand they are starting you know to

00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:44,359
provide services on consulting because

00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,760
obviously they want to grow which on the

00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:48,470
other hand on our side will say oh well

00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,570
if they are now starting you know

00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:53,660
consulting then what about our business

00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:55,520
model so this is this is I don't have a

00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:59,570
solution to it it's an ongoing struggle

00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:02,410
over the years yeah but it's it's it's

00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:05,990
really a vital question how to how to

00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:07,140
have this lively and healthy this

00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,000
relationship

00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,010
a relationship where multiple companies

00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,630
can actually contribute I mean something

00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:14,400
like OpenStack of course I've managed to

00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,450
do that I mean it's possible but it's

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,730
different

00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:20,280
well the cute community manages as well

00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:22,710
I'm just saying this is it is hard work

00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,030
from both sides all of the time I mean

00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,890
there are the competitors on the market

00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:27,870
to also contribute to cute and they are

00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,910
basically in the same situation as we

00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,410
are yeah all right

00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:33,300
maybe it's time for the next question

00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:35,730
unless someone else wants to bring

00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:40,080
something in it's not then we move on to

00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:51,180
the next point let's refresh the panel

00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:53,850
and welcome to join again okay so a bit

00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:56,190
of a change of theme with funding and

00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:59,690
raising venture capital funding or from

00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:03,030
other private investors in order to get

00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:05,040
you know what do they call it a hyper

00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:06,960
growth and in order to compete with

00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,670
other startups in a particular sector

00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,910
funding is often a critical ingredient

00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:13,560
and we had an intense debate some of

00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:15,090
people news from last night around the

00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,540
pros and cons and the challenges that

00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:19,890
open source firms face but it seems to

00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,560
me it's much harder for open source

00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:24,620
firms to raise venture capital like for

00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,700
like I'm thinking about early-stage

00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:28,080
firms at this point but I'd really love

00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,120
to hear experience from anybody who's

00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,310
actually tried pitching an open-source

00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,140
business or business model whether the

00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:37,140
product whatever stage the product was

00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:39,690
at and and how that went what kind of

00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,860
reactions you you got so that's first of

00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:44,160
all have a show of hands anybody

00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:49,350
successfully raised funds for their open

00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:53,299
source business one two three I know

00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:58,950
Hortonworks did okay

00:53:53,299 --> 00:54:00,440
okay so the question is has anybody an

00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:05,579
experienced or seen

00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:07,650
semi-closed how to do it yeah can I ask

00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:18,270
you to join the panel at the back thank

00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:19,740
you and yeah please and by the way if

00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:22,770
you've tried but it didn't work

00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:26,069
yeah anybody trying and not succeed yet

00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:27,809
or at all so everybody who tried to

00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:29,970
raise funding for ever succeeded or

00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:32,130
maybe people are just too shy to admit

00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:35,039
okay good good thank you for being brave

00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:36,720
enough to talk about that the

00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:40,880
unsuccessful ones too can I give some

00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,880
some microphones around

00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:50,339
I've actually been only involved it sort

00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,089
of arm's length I haven't been in front

00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:58,500
of any Vesey's both with a successful

00:54:54,089 --> 00:55:00,890
and an unsuccessful project in the case

00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:04,380
of the successful project it was because

00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:07,079
it was based on the humanitarian free

00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,779
open-source project that the investor

00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:12,240
had been supporting up to that point and

00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:14,220
it was a pitch to thee and to the

00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,980
investor to say we would like to make

00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:20,099
this self-sustaining by building a

00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:22,289
business on it so it was who is the

00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:24,510
investor investing whether he's not

00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:26,970
saying at this point okay but are they

00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:28,529
are they a typical type of VC they

00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:36,240
specialize in humanitarian products it's

00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:38,819
just a very rich person favorite so they

00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,770
were supporting the project for for that

00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:43,910
philanthropic reason yes exactly so

00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:45,809
originally he was supporting the project

00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:47,430
because he believes in it and he still

00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:50,069
supports the project because he believes

00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:52,020
in it but he's not going to live forever

00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:54,299
and he knows that and he would like the

00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,730
project to continue and so he was

00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:59,670
looking for ways to make that happen and

00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:02,670
one suggestion was to make a company

00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:06,410
for-profit based on this humanitarian

00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:06,410
mission so a social entrepreneurship

00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:16,220
and he has invested quite a bit actually

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:18,410
in the company based on that mission the

00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:24,110
next project that I worked on that

00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:25,370
didn't succeed just like if you talk to

00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:30,020
a lot of people and you don't get money

00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:31,940
and they're not very open about why so I

00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:36,710
mean you get like it's a great idea and

00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:38,000
like well then do you do you feel or

00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:40,540
suspect that open source played a

00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,110
particular role in that decision it

00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,300
could be

00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:47,480
I don't like there's a lot of

00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:50,510
possibilities um and if it's open source

00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:53,270
and it's hard to to say how you

00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:56,330
differentiate yourself and from existing

00:56:53,270 --> 00:57:00,920
or future potential competitors on the

00:56:56,330 --> 00:57:02,300
market people like VCS what to earn a

00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,790
lot of money that's kind of what they're

00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,710
in it for and if there's a low profit

00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:07,850
margin or a low potential profit margin

00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:11,600
because somebody else is going to get in

00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:15,170
on it and compete right away then they

00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:21,680
just don't get in would you share your

00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:25,730
experiences I've had several experiences

00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:28,130
and if I can sum up in running an

00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:29,960
opportunist if you want to pitch PCs you

00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:32,510
can only get money if you don't actually

00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,240
need it's really so that would give you

00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:36,920
the money for growth but if you actually

00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,620
need money to actually launch your

00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:42,070
company you would not find them there's

00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:45,020
another thing I had in mind which is

00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:47,330
this is actually they invest money to

00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:49,700
resell the shares so they want to create

00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:52,640
an assets literally they want to create

00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:54,500
something that they own and they don't

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,060
really like the idea that they don't own

00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,710
on that open source software is not

00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:59,030
owned is something you share it's not

00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:02,210
something you own it's not a property

00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:04,100
you own and may ask this is particular

00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:07,010
feedback you've received like are these

00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:09,620
comments that oh yeah yes specific

00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:11,720
feedback and experience and time and

00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:14,630
ones oh wait no don't energy lost in

00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:17,030
trying to do that effort and you felt it

00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:18,980
and and so if the same model the same

00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:20,750
pitch that you've been making was for

00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,250
the same product but with

00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,260
proprietary license you feel the outcome

00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:28,760
but I would say it's several things I

00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:31,760
would say it also depends on what DC

00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,860
community you're talking about I have a

00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,710
specific experience with the French

00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:39,320
environment and there you have people

00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:41,270
that behave more like bankers or fund

00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,710
managers and they don't want to risk any

00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:47,630
money I mean they be seized with no risk

00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:50,720
the risk of this is a bit harsh to this

00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:53,510
but it's long time and if you spend

00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,550
there I would say that you you do have

00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:57,950
saved on the way so school not North

00:58:55,550 --> 00:59:03,230
America this is that to have more vision

00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:04,670
and more likely to gamble on so so you

00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:07,580
have those won't gamble those no wanna

00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:10,460
gamble that but what I want to say but

00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:12,710
assets and property is something else I

00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:15,890
realized from from the VC community

00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:17,780
where they meet the academic community

00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:20,720
somewhere because in universities or

00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:24,440
research industry Institute's they also

00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:27,080
want to create assets IPSS that they

00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,910
want to sell and you have the same kind

00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,130
of reaction where people want to have

00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:33,530
these kind of IP assets that they want

00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,600
to be able to resell to monetize at some

00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:38,270
point and when you pitch them with an

00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,190
open source business model it's not that

00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:42,590
what you sell you don't sell the asset

00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:44,390
you sell custom ownership you sell your

00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:47,780
customer base and that's where the value

00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:49,460
is really just to finish that point can

00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:51,620
I could I ask where what happened in the

00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,690
end of this story so after you had these

00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:55,640
experiences no that's about several

00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,950
experiences and some some gotten money

00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,990
and some didn't get the money so you did

00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:03,170
successfully raise funds in some cases

00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:04,700
for your yes yes and was it was it I

01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,650
mean differences between the failures

01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,990
and successes was it something changed

01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:10,670
in your case no it was the thing is you

01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:13,400
could raise money if you really have a

01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:15,170
customer base or flow of orders rent and

01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,690
when you don't see in in the end the

01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:22,220
lesson is you get the money if you don't

01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:23,420
need it can I ask how you funded getting

01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:25,550
to the point where you didn't need it

01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,750
how did you how did you get to the point

01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,800
of being cashflow positive or having a

01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,900
community was large enough to

01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,610
demonstrate the value I'm spending and

01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,400
having and signing a few customers and

01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:35,890
building up a credible

01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:39,820
customer base and prospect of critical

01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:40,900
prospects at least thank you

01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:44,500
perhaps you'd like to share your

01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:46,150
experience yes I've raised money for a

01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,460
number of businesses at different stages

01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:50,260
of those businesses and I agree 100%

01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,690
going and getting seed money initially

01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:55,060
hey here's my business plan I'm gonna

01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:58,090
make you lots of money is not impossible

01:00:55,060 --> 01:01:00,850
I think is a it's a red herring specific

01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:03,400
leave open source it's a red herring

01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:08,980
that open source and open source doesn't

01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:11,110
really matter it's well in my employ in

01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:13,000
my experiences have you got a good

01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:15,010
business plan do they trust you to

01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,200
deliver that business plan have you got

01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:19,150
any credibility in previously delivering

01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,040
that spreadsheets and the fact you don't

01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,720
own the IP outright or you're at the

01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,860
same degree of control in an open source

01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,280
case doesn't make a difference in your

01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:29,050
records you know what it depends what

01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,220
the business model is around open source

01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:35,140
so going to to raise money with you know

01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:37,360
I'm planning to build a support business

01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:40,570
around a Apache project is a completely

01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,680
different thing to I'm gonna build a new

01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:43,420
engine which is going to sit underneath

01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,310
Cuban eighties you know that they're two

01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:50,860
completely in which of those have you

01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:53,290
tried the support model both ah so

01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:55,600
actually my current camera showed blue

01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:57,970
we I was in a very fortunate position

01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,010
that I was effectively the seed capital

01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:02,170
because I just exited a previous

01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:04,360
business and we we haven't had to do any

01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:05,740
further funding rounds but I've been on

01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,630
the advisory board of a number of

01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:10,090
companies where we've had to go and get

01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:11,530
them some initial funding some angel

01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:13,900
funding and a lot of that comes down to

01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:16,690
trying to find somebody who understands

01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:18,160
the space somebody who is probably

01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:19,750
working in that space he's just sold

01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,660
their own startup that that sort of

01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:24,130
thing but you know trying to go

01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:25,270
institutionally and ask for Sica if

01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:26,830
you're not know and if you haven't

01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:31,960
proven that you can do this a few times

01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:32,950
round one once you have a running visit

01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,200
it doesn't necessarily have to be

01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:38,170
cashflow positive but once you're in the

01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,940
situation that you know you have

01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,920
traction for your product you are

01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:43,720
demonstrating your business plan is

01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,650
moving in the right direction that

01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:48,190
becomes a whole

01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:50,369
easily a conversation and most from

01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:52,960
experience most of the institutional

01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:55,539
investors certainly in London where I am

01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,920
a lot of them are closely related to

01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:58,569
Silicon Valley companies a lot of them

01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:01,270
are Silicon Valley companies with the

01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:02,140
London offices they completely get this

01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:04,000
okay

01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:06,309
they understand open source they

01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,230
understand the technology they have you

01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:09,700
know people in residents who have come

01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:12,099
out of a lot of these projects so

01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,450
certainly don't be scared by that they

01:03:12,099 --> 01:03:15,700
understand it and they embrace the

01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:18,400
concept semster completely completely I

01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:19,900
I might say I don't know if red herrings

01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,329
have ever just in English terms it but

01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:25,059
it's a yeah I think it's a misconception

01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:27,279
- it's over playing it too much to say

01:03:25,059 --> 01:03:38,589
open source is the big thing here that's

01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:41,440
almost on page 5 of the business plan so

01:03:38,589 --> 01:03:43,990
Hortonworks of course we had the huge

01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,960
advantage that brought Bearden was at

01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:49,210
entry at a venture capital firm right he

01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,190
was at benchmark and so he knew what he

01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:53,859
wanted in an open source company and

01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:57,250
that was a huge leg up the other

01:03:53,859 --> 01:03:58,630
advantage that it comes from it saying

01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:01,000
you're going to do an open source

01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:02,710
company especially for a project that's

01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,869
already successful in meeting customer's

01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:07,990
needs is that you've already distributed

01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:09,819
just demonstrated that that community is

01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:13,059
there right you're solving real problems

01:04:09,819 --> 01:04:15,880
with real code and so if you can take

01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:19,119
that and say ok we're going to leverage

01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:21,549
that community you're a huge step up on

01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,829
someone who just has a slide deck right

01:04:21,549 --> 01:04:29,079
and that that's actually a huge huge

01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:31,089
point I totally agree so huge advantage

01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:32,770
so just just to clarify damage for open

01:04:31,089 --> 01:04:35,140
source companies is that you've already

01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:36,789
demonstrated that you've got a usable

01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:41,420
product that's helping people solve real

01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:43,549
problems Thanks from from the point

01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:45,319
I have to I have to intervene with with

01:04:43,549 --> 01:04:49,400
the open-source part that there is no

01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:50,540
differentiator the problem for and just

01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:54,380
a little background

01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:59,960
I've personally not made any direct vc

01:04:54,380 --> 01:05:01,460
deal but i assisted and many and let's

01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:04,400
call it this way I know many wealthy

01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:06,829
people that can help in that area so the

01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:11,390
thing is is as the the thinking of a VC

01:05:06,829 --> 01:05:12,740
is that he wants to have the highest

01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:14,750
possible gain at the lowest possible

01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:17,809
risk so the lowest possible risk

01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:19,670
nowadays is not that that important

01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:22,190
anymore and which is good for

01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:23,900
open-source actually but because we've

01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:26,359
got more risk to deal with is that the

01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:28,099
problem is just a general market at the

01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:30,619
moment the interest rates are everywhere

01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:32,650
down so basically investors try to find

01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:35,900
places where to put their money in and

01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:37,369
the problem is is you know when you when

01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,869
you have it's it's like on a stock

01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:41,240
market if you have something where you

01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:42,920
know hey this is secure your interest

01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,200
rate is low but if you want to take

01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:49,369
chance your possibilities are endless so

01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:51,349
the thing is is with open source there

01:05:49,369 --> 01:05:53,480
are certain B C's in the world which

01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:55,430
understand open source right Andy

01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,559
bechtolsheim is a perfect example of

01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:59,329
that right he really knows what he's

01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:00,740
talking about he really knows open

01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:02,750
source he knows the mentality and he

01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:04,640
knows the benefits of it because that

01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:06,230
just that you're doing open source

01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,790
doesn't mean that you cannot materialize

01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:10,010
a business out of it Red Hat and others

01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:13,160
are perfect examples for that but the

01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:16,099
major problem is is that when you and

01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:18,200
that's that ties in with your point when

01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:20,540
you want to when when you want to run a

01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:22,849
business that has the core of open

01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:25,040
source you need proof

01:06:22,849 --> 01:06:26,900
you need proof of it and that is only

01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,329
something that you can do by community

01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:32,089
by cus proof of what specifically proof

01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:33,859
of that the product works that no hope

01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:35,599
of a business model no the proof of

01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:37,970
business model cannot be proven in any

01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:40,280
way I mean that's the idea of a business

01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:41,720
plan right it gives you a path and you

01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:45,230
can think like yeah that sounds like a

01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:46,970
good bet or not but the the only proof

01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:49,160
that you can have and that's where we're

01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:51,829
open source really where really has a

01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,930
big advantage actually is is this that

01:06:51,829 --> 01:06:55,510
you can prove and say like

01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:57,400
I have this user base I have like 500

01:06:55,510 --> 01:07:00,010
developers in the back they know what

01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:02,500
they're doing they had also the team

01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:03,970
part is also a big aspect 500 community

01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:06,400
developers you mean yes

01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:09,670
500 community developers or thousands of

01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,980
installations running in production this

01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:15,760
is important stuff because they know hey

01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:18,910
I can monetize that because I know you

01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:21,790
know I as a VC and then have the option

01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:25,750
to say hey this is something I want to a

01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:27,910
monetize B I can develop C I know it's

01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:29,740
really a need so I see the target group

01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:32,440
which I can approach and grow but they

01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:34,720
will never own the IPO in the same sorry

01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:37,569
the IP way to the others would but and

01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:40,540
that's the big thing here when you have

01:07:37,569 --> 01:07:44,500
an open-source product that does not

01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:47,859
mean that you automatically have the the

01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:49,630
knowledge to maintain it obviously an on

01:07:47,859 --> 01:07:51,640
cloud next card this thing was very

01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:53,589
special because a lot of people from the

01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:56,349
own cloud team fort basically their own

01:07:53,589 --> 01:08:01,450
project and this is a this is obviously

01:07:56,349 --> 01:08:03,579
a logistical fear from from a VC but the

01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:07,180
reality is it's the larger the community

01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:09,490
is the harder it actually is executed I

01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:11,859
don't want to name any projects here but

01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:15,760
there are even in the office area good

01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:18,699
examples of how a fork can also not run

01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:22,929
too well let's call that way there are

01:08:18,699 --> 01:08:25,290
there are also areas where look in a

01:08:22,929 --> 01:08:27,640
security area and in the encryption area

01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:29,770
the thing is is you need traction you

01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,839
need base and when you get that then you

01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:33,759
at least have higher chances the same

01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,130
Florian departed I think he'd have

01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:39,790
something to say can we just take the

01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:41,049
last two just about so I'm in a hundred

01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:43,690
percent agreement with you they have my

01:08:41,049 --> 01:08:45,250
point around it doesn't really matter as

01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:47,319
open sources we framed this from the

01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:49,569
context of looking for problems with

01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:51,330
open source and raising money I'm saying

01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:54,489
it is not a problem it's only a positive

01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:56,259
and it's only a positive in terms of you

01:08:54,489 --> 01:08:58,359
know we talk about minimum minimum

01:08:56,259 --> 01:08:59,980
viable product etc normally when you're

01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:02,080
raising money around open source you're

01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:04,299
already there you have the community you

01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,950
have customers even if they aren't

01:09:04,299 --> 01:09:06,180
paying cost

01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:08,280
that's right there people who are using

01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:10,920
the software and yet when we look at the

01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:12,150
number of companies which are so you

01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,680
know providing only open source

01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:16,260
solutions which are valued at a billion

01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:17,430
dollars or more or have received 100

01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:20,430
million dollars in venture capital

01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:22,530
investment or more it's a we're talking

01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:24,330
about ten fingers more money you know

01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:27,320
like it's it's with tiny tiny numbers

01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:28,650
there's a big global economic question

01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,850
fair enough

01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:31,440
can we take the like the last point from

01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:33,390
you know everything very important is

01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,980
that the basics of VC funding still

01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:37,200
apply to any open source businesses

01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:38,880
which is the team and they're really

01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,170
investing the team so it's not just

01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,270
about technology you could have a very

01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:44,400
bright guy in technologies I have myself

01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:46,290
lost a lot of money with four very

01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,870
bright guys who suddenly disappeared and

01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:49,980
played Devers and the thing is you need

01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:52,290
to have people who are committed to

01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:53,700
building that as a real business so in

01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:55,170
the challenges of pachinko commercial

01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:57,750
businesses you really need to have the

01:09:55,170 --> 01:10:01,710
team and the more experienced and now we

01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:04,350
have people pitching VC's who've been

01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:06,570
through several generations of several

01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:08,010
companies like for instance in your case

01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:09,990
you've been through so you have the

01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:12,360
experience and that's a lot of

01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:15,180
credibility now the other thing is you

01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:16,560
need to have the whole the what you've

01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:18,840
mentioned already covered all radio but

01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,220
product decisions and scan your business

01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:23,790
modular scales because you can have a

01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:25,830
very bright tech technology team that

01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:27,750
can develop something but it's all but

01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:30,240
they say execution so these all the

01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:32,070
basics all the basics the 101 of VC

01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:35,040
funding totally applies to open source

01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:36,690
with maybe a little pinch of difficulty

01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,880
but also of interest because you have to

01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:41,460
figure out that open source is much more

01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,900
in the mainstream has got so much more

01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:44,400
in the mainstream over the last five six

01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,050
years I mean when the opens that I could

01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,230
open and know that and probably with AI

01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:51,720
this new wave of things coming up all

01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:54,150
right I guess that is note on which we

01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:56,550
and I found interesting you point that

01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:58,560
maybe there aren't just enough people

01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:00,750
have done it before there's not enough

01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:04,080
experience that's at least one way of

01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:06,150
thinking that we just have to keep

01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,260
trying as community and suddenly there

01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:10,290
will be more Red Hat's

01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:11,790
someday so we're at the end of our time

01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:12,910
I mean people for the next talk I think

01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:14,800
are already coming in

01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:16,600
it would be really great if you could

01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,490
all help quickly to put the chairs back

01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,220
because you know we made a mess and

01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:22,750
thank you for meditation really

01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:27,090
appreciate it

01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:27,090
