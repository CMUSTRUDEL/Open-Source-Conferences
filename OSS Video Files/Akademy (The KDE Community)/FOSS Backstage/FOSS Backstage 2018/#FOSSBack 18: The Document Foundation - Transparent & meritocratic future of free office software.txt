Title: #FOSSBack 18: The Document Foundation - Transparent & meritocratic future of free office software
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	The Document Foundation (TDF) is the charitable entity behind LibreOffice, the free office suite. It not only provides a legal framework for the project, but also manages assets and donations to support the further development of the software as well as the community. 

The organizational setup of TDF is rather unique - by having chosen a German "Stiftung", the community has opted for an entity that is recognized as strong, stable and enduring. Its statutes provide for independence of a single corporate sponsor, and at the same time focus on the core values of transparency, openness and meritocracy. 

In his talk, Florian Effenberger, Executive Director and one of the founders of The Document Foundation, gives an overview on how the foundation was set up, what goals it has achieved in the last six years of its existence and what plans and visions the community has for their future.

so thank you very much and for joining

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,750
and my title is quite a mouthful

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,269
actually but it's on purpose as it

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,070
already illustrates what I'm gonna talk

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,859
about so you get to know what the

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:24,509
document foundation is what we do how it

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,999
relates to two LibreOffice and you see

00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:29,489
open transparent and meritocratic these

00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:32,910
are three core elements of what we do

00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:34,829
and in my talk I'd like to explain you

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,430
what this means what is this about and

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,040
how we achieved that so first of all a

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,440
couple of words on to me so I've been in

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,200
that free office space area and an open

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,360
source per se for like I think 14 15

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,430
years I've been previously indeed but

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,280
with open office work then join Libre

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,640
Office from day zero was one of the

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,250
cofounders of TDF and nowadays I work as

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,620
its executive director should I find

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,750
some spare time I'm involved a bit in

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,610
infrastructure and marketing but my my

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,069
day job is really working as executive

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,469
director of TDF and does a task with

00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,600
handling our team our projects of

00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:14,369
budgeting all of those those kind of

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,499
things but I've been heavily involved in

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,780
the set up of TDF as well and like to

00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:21,450
share a bit what the ideas behind that

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,880
were how we set it up and why we did say

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,170
it did set up things in the way we in

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,270
the end did so first of all on my

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,759
opening slide you've seen this this big

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,889
libreoffice logo and under need a

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,409
smaller tagline the document foundation

00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:39,719
that's actually one part of the

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,369
explanation already because the document

00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,770
foundation literally built the

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,310
foundation on which libre office is

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,049
built at libre office itself stands for

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,840
not just one thing that stands for two

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,119
things and one is software and one is

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,189
the project so we do of course have

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,420
Libre Office as a software that runs

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,310
here on my machine it runs on your

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,909
mobile it runs in the browser we see

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,819
that a bit later and that is used by

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,250
millions of users worldwide and at the

00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,869
same time it is the name of the project

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,120
of the community of the people behind

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,819
that driving that developing it

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,819
marketing it

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,680
translating it doing QA on it localizing

00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:21,889
it documenting it providing the

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,260
infrastructure that's hundreds of if not

00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:26,749
thousands of contributors worldwide join

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,530
the project working jointly on what we

00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:33,349
do and so that is the double meaning of

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,209
Libre Office and the second thing that

00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:37,700
we do have is the document foundation

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:41,150
that is the legal entity behind that it

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,280
on purpose does not have to name Libre

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,499
Office so if you look in our statutes

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
you won't find the name Libre Office at

00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:51,139
all it's it's not mentioned there and

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,609
that is precisely on purpose one reason

00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:54,560
is that of course at the beginning it

00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:58,400
was a tad unclear what the final product

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,769
would be named and then ii see in a

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,560
minute the idea behind the document

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:08,269
foundation is to provide space for more

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,230
projects in fact so that's how it was

00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:16,129
created and if you look at the statutes

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,349
of TDF you find one sentence and that is

00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,599
the objective of the foundation is the

00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:23,000
promotion and development of office

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,199
software available for use by anyone

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,909
free of charge

00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,680
so you might see it's actually the

00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:29,180
translation of the official german

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,819
statutes and we have quite known for

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,790
having long and utter art sentences but

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:38,259
there's a lot of that what we do in that

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:41,389
so TDF itself first of all is a

00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:44,389
foundation or a stiff tone in german

00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:46,879
where he pasted here right in berlin but

00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:48,769
in fact if you look at our offices you

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,349
won't find anything so we completely

00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:54,139
distributed across the world but it's

00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:56,750
really in in berlin is just our seat but

00:03:54,139 --> 00:04:00,079
nobody really is there so we'd be once

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,090
had somebody passing by our office and I

00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,739
wanted to talk to someone was completely

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,310
surprised they didn't find anyone to

00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,819
talk to

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:12,349
so we really we need a legal seat but we

00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:15,349
are working from all of the world and so

00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,870
what is our mission a foundation is to

00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,799
see but later this is built on a on a

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,889
mission statement of donors will

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,530
and what does TDF do first of all and

00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:30,610
I've highlighted here in in bold we do

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:33,099
promote what we do so that means we

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,620
support we spread the word we encourage

00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:38,289
people to join we do marketing on that

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,659
and second we can also get active and

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:42,849
develop ourselves so those are two

00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:45,520
important bits we can develop the

00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:47,169
software and we can promote the software

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,669
and the ideals and the philosophy behind

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:54,009
that then the space that we cover is

00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:56,139
office software so it's not just Libre

00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:58,930
Office or not just a word processor but

00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:02,909
it is office software and that is a term

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:05,259
that is a bit open to interpretation so

00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:07,120
office software of course means the

00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,430
office productivity software yes we have

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,490
it right now it could contain an email

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,469
client it maybe could contain software

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,690
for drawing but I'd say it could not

00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:18,610
contain software for composers because

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,800
that is not office anymore but group

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,550
where on the other side could be in that

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,280
again

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,900
so office software is the space we cover

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,830
with the prime product that we have

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,529
being Libre Office of course and that's

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:36,639
that's that the scope we act the scope

00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:39,789
within react and then important is for

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,800
use by anyone you see later that for

00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,900
example contains that we do localized

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,969
product that we do document it in a lot

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,580
of languages because we would like as

00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:51,039
many people as possible take part in it

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,409
use it contribute to it and that also

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,080
means reaching people whose prime

00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:58,389
language is not English so anyone that's

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,520
in the statutes and then free of course

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:03,460
free software can also use it free of

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,620
charge so that's the disco within we act

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,300
and this is the mission statement the

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,879
foundation's objective that we do have

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,279
so to recap we have libre office the

00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,529
software we have the community that is

00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,240
acting worldwide and we have a

00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:19,449
foundation that has a mission statement

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,270
that does not only cover Libre Office

00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:26,349
but a broader range but within the

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:28,300
office space and the actual paragraph is

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,550
much lower so there is a mention of open

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,029
standards and so on but that's the frame

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,449
within react

00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:39,829
and that is actually quite important to

00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:42,049
tell you why so looking back at where

00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:43,789
we've been coming from and to situation

00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:46,549
we were in a couple of years ago there

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:49,279
were a lot of ideas that we already had

00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:51,019
in the community that we lived by for

00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,679
quite some time but did we wanted to

00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:57,679
have secured and guaranteed and some of

00:06:54,679 --> 00:07:00,860
these we put and anchored in the

00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:04,360
statutes and that is of course as

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:07,579
mentioned we support the development but

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,499
equally the community and the product so

00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:10,969
it's not just focused on a software and

00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:14,119
it's not just focused on the project

00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:17,839
it's actually both the way we do and we

00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:19,789
do this on a variety of with a variety

00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,969
of tasks like attending events giving

00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:24,769
talks participating in trade shows the

00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:26,959
mentoring developers on the other hand

00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:30,039
doing marketing spreading the divert

00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:33,079
about free software and open standards

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,999
so that is part of the philosophy that

00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:38,110
we support development and that we

00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:40,459
support that for both product and

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,539
community and there is no no preference

00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:46,399
in the statute so both have in theory to

00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:48,019
be fostered equally of course you ever

00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,169
you have maybe a slightly different

00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:54,949
focus per se PDF as entity has to

00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:56,779
support motion then for us it was

00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:00,799
extremely important to build something

00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:02,479
that focuses on those ideals values that

00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:04,669
we have been working with they never

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,499
have been really formalized it was just

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:09,439
principle that that we used to work

00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:12,079
together and what we have done is that

00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,839
we anchored those ideals that we

00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:18,259
considered very crucial deeply down in

00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,809
the statutes and statutes is something

00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:23,749
that TDF is bound to so they are really

00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:26,239
on a on a legal level bound and anchored

00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:28,339
and written down and acknowledged by

00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:31,789
everybody so it's really finding that

00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:34,519
was important for us a third thing that

00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:36,829
we were looking into is independence and

00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,439
that part is sometimes a bit

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:41,179
misunderstood so it's not that we want

00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:43,339
to be completely independent from

00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,900
sponsors that's not what we want to be

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,270
and probably luckily our

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:51,020
to be independent from one single

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,810
sponsor so we do have corporate sponsors

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,790
it's a little bit later but the majority

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,280
of income indeed when when it comes to

00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,290
money comes from individual donors and

00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,590
we have around seventy thousand

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,590
individual donations per year apart from

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,940
the Sun this makes this is to Murad it

00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,070
would sign because you have such a broad

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,010
user base people supporting our efforts

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,560
people donating smaller amount like

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,860
eight nine ten euro supporting us

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,270
worldwide and that is I think one very

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,040
important sign of very important

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,260
confirmation and that was one of the

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,570
goals to be independent from one single

00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:30,050
sponsor but rather have a broad

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,870
supporter base what we aim for as well

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,510
is to provide an ecosystem so TDF itself

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,430
is not a participant in the market you

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,160
cannot buy anything from PDF we don't

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,410
provide support we don't provide paid

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,340
bug fixes that is something for an

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,470
ecosystem and that goes with the bullet

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,720
point above that we of course do need an

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,000
ecosystem we need people that actually

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,650
run a business model around that that's

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,340
that's absolutely fair enough that they

00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:00,560
are all part of the community so we try

00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,080
to foster the ecosystem to also have

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,660
corporate supporters in there and that

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,340
happens on a couple of air or in a

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,530
couple of areas one of these is

00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,230
certification that's something we have

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,540
been fostering for the last three four

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,760
years that we do provide certification

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,160
for developers we do provide

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,950
certification for trainers and migration

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,500
experts and actually these are asked for

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,230
so we know for a couple for example of

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,540
tenders where a specific requirement has

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,460
been a certified libreoffice developer

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,620
so by that that's one of the means we

00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:37,670
try to foster the commercial ecosystem

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:40,160
around that another philosophy was and

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,530
also looking back at our history to

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,320
lower entry barriers so I have to admit

00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,090
I'm not a developer myself but from what

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,920
I've heard the code base especially in

00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,290
the old days has been rather complicated

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,510
rather hard to get into and we wanted to

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,060
lower those entry barriers like in the

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,850
talks we've been given eight nine years

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,610
ago we always said we have many

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,990
in all areas of the project except for

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,440
development because it was so

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,690
complicated and so for us one of the key

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,420
items is to lower those entry barriers

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,319
we do that by easy hacks that is

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,839
identifying lower hanging fruits easy

00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:19,300
ways into the code we do that by running

00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,660
hackfest will participant in the google

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,389
Summer of Code we run workshops so

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,029
that's one of the means we get people in

00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:29,620
we try to lower entry barriers make it

00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:32,440
easier make it more friendly more

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,180
inviting to contribute and of course

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,060
we're not completely alone in the space

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,040
we do have lots of partnerships we work

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:43,209
with other organizations very proudly

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,800
and in the end how we describe TDF is

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:47,500
that is has been created by the

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,690
community with crowdfunding and with

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,449
collecting ideas for the statutes in the

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,579
set up and it is dedicated for the

00:11:52,449 --> 00:12:01,180
entire community so that is the very

00:11:54,579 --> 00:12:03,490
base philosophy behind CDF so how does

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,050
this look like that's its theory that's

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,470
what we want to have but how do we

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:11,050
manage that actually the first question

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,579
we often hear is and that's especially

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,949
for those who have bit more familiar

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:16,779
with the German law system so why did

00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:19,079
you go for a system it's not the easiest

00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:21,600
thing to set up and maybe not the most

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:25,509
prominent one you have associations

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,240
around space so why why a foundation

00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:31,750
also here it goes back a lot to our

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,029
history what we wanted to have is first

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,100
of all something that is stable there

00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:37,449
were lots of uncertainties and we didn't

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,490
know how things would look like and we

00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:43,300
wanted to build something where at least

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,920
the the base parameters provide for

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,870
something that is stable and there is

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,389
the saying that foundations are built

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,250
for eternity of course not all of them

00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,839
are but some of them are really really

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,360
old already and with the whole

00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,220
onboarding process and creating a

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,389
foundation here at least in Germany and

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,370
I think it's similar for many other

00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:02,050
countries it takes a huge amount of

00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,839
effort and revenue and you really get

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,309
audited a lot whether the concept you

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,990
provide in the statutes or provide

00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,490
really would work out so that's

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,360
something we wanted we wanted something

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,190
that is stable that

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,810
as the best parameters for being an

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:19,430
enduring entity very important for us

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:22,010
and that's the major difference to an

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,740
association is that the objective cannot

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:28,070
be changed so at least in plane theory

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,019
if you run a regular Association and all

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,720
your members want to change the

00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:34,670
objective for example supporting free

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,490
software to supporting proprietary

00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,440
software at least in theory it's

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,570
possible this has to be changed it has a

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,190
lot of implications it can be worked

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,480
around a bit by the statutes but in

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,440
theory it's possible because a

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,370
foundation is built on the donors will

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,170
expressed by the objective and the

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,779
statutes and an association by the

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:57,529
members will so that was very important

00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:59,630
for us and as such TDF is some entity

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,060
that provides lots of safety because

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,010
everybody knows my contributions are

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:08,029
subject to those rules and those cannot

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:11,420
really be changed and we try to provide

00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:13,279
that safety for the community for the

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,860
end-users and the commercial ecosystem

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,160
so really for everyone in that space we

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:22,190
want to provide that what do we do as a

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,680
legal entity like most legal entities we

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,230
don't have the big strategy decisions

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,899
ourselves that's up to the project what

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:33,500
TDF in its core tasks does is to act as

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:35,360
a sort of trustee so we hold funds we

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,550
hold trademarks we hold the main names

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,860
we read illegal entity we can sign

00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,680
contracts that's I guess what what many

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,510
of the organizations do on their on the

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,899
base level and we do that for the

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:50,180
projects that are part of TDF so we we

00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:51,920
do handle the donations as said we are

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,380
not part of the commercial ecosystem

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,850
ourselves so you cannot buy anything at

00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,140
EDF that's what we have the commercial

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:02,000
ecosystem for but EDF aims to

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,620
guaranteeing rights for everybody who is

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,779
involved and that was very important for

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,459
us especially looking at history and the

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,250
back and forth and those those rules

00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:12,050
that we stick to but that were not

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,550
really enforceable and we wanted

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:19,690
something where it's clear and where it

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:22,069
can be enforced so I taught a lot about

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,720
openness and about how we structured

00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:28,259
philosophy so how actually are we set up

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,709
how do our bodies look like how is TDF

00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:33,480
structured so first of all like many

00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:36,209
organizations we do have a board of

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,319
directors that is simply the legal

00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:43,230
representative of TDF and we have a I

00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:45,540
think rather large board at least four

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,209
for German standards with seven seat

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:51,180
holders and three deputies they jump in

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:53,279
when seat holders are not available or

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,850
when they leave the board and they then

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,129
basically jump into that role I'm very

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,959
happy that we do have quite a good

00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:02,939
mixture already of community members

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,399
that means from various countries that

00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:06,750
arise backgrounds some of them making a

00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:12,540
professional living out of Libre Office

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:14,459
others don't some of them really active

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,560
in various areas of the project we have

00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:18,120
people more active and infrastructure

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,139
more active and development and the like

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,480
so we try to we aim for having

00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,160
candidates who really cover many of the

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,589
areas that TDF and the LibreOffice

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,350
project work for and you see the list of

00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:33,300
countries so that that's quite

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,370
impressive I'm especially happy for

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,410
Taiwan because those countries are

00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,269
further away and having someone in the

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,660
board to represent them is quite

00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:44,399
important I think so that's what we have

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,170
but how is the board elected how does

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,389
that work and that's the point where we

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:52,189
have basically invented something new

00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:55,680
you could even say we kind of worked the

00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:59,069
foundation model in a German law at

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,720
least because if you look online you

00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:02,790
will be told that a foundation doesn't

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,980
have any members and the Association has

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,100
a foundation doesn't and we actually

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,720
have something in between we have in

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,319
English it's the Board of Trustees the

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:17,579
literal German translation would be the

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:20,520
Board of Trustees of members and so we

00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,260
have some close to members element in

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,870
that and that's one of the key items

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,439
that we have quite proud of that we have

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:31,230
a model where anyone who contributes to

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,760
the good of the foundation to fulfilling

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,549
its mission whether it's in libreoffice

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,539
project or in other projects or in

00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:40,080
foundation administrative work

00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:42,789
that those people can when they have

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,059
contributed for the last three months

00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:47,440
there is no no threshold they have to

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,389
read it must be some sensible

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,940
contribution but there is not an amount

00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:54,970
of hours any hard limit that they then

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:58,450
can ask to be approved as a member of

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:00,909
TDF and that status is always granted on

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,409
an individual basis that means even if

00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:04,179
you work for a company and you're paid

00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:05,979
to develop for libre office or to

00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:09,340
consult on libre office you personally

00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:12,099
can apply to be a member and that

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,809
happens for one year and after one year

00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:16,779
you can get the status again we can

00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:18,190
reconfirm it if you don't contribute it

00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,229
will not be a member anymore but you can

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,379
join any time again and the idea is

00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:25,149
exactly this meritocracy that those

00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:26,559
people who are active who contribute

00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:28,269
whether it's pro bono whether it's

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,109
during the paint job that doesn't matter

00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:33,999
that they can steer the ship and the

00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:36,009
only thing that does not qualify is

00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:37,869
donation so you cannot by yourself in

00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:39,369
even if you donate a 1 million you would

00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:41,859
not automatically be approved as a

00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:44,139
member the nations do not qualify but

00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:47,590
really work that you invest time that

00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:49,059
you invest now how are those members

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,649
selected because if the board would

00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,599
select the members themselves could be a

00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:54,460
rather closed circle the board appoints

00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,169
the members the members they can elect

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,389
the board and they can be elected into

00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:00,669
the board that's a problem so what we

00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:02,979
have set up as well is a so-called

00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:07,840
membership committee it's also an

00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:11,769
official body of TDF and similar model

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,109
with 5 seat holders and 4 deputies they

00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:16,090
also run a term of two years or so here

00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:18,789
re-election as possible the only

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,049
limitation that's maximum of 10% of the

00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:21,549
members can be in the membership

00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:24,639
committee so that number is actually

00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:27,249
flexible and that's exactly what they do

00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:30,220
they approve new members they revoke

00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:31,570
members if need be they see what has

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,679
been contributed whether they would

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:37,869
qualify for membership and same room

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,379
this board of trustees or the members

00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:42,999
they elect the membership committee and

00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:45,789
they can be elected under the membership

00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:48,369
committee and we have some more checks

00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:50,379
and balances the elections are mutually

00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:51,440
overseen that means the membership

00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:52,610
committee oversees two

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,559
what elections in the board of the

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:58,399
system Membership Committee elections

00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,799
and then we have one more thing at EDF

00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:04,519
that has the name board in it that's or

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,679
advisory board that is in contrast to

00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,990
the Board of Trustees indeed dedicated

00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,299
for companies and for organizations for

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,539
entities and although it's called board

00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:16,460
it's not a formal body of TDF so their

00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:21,440
role is to advise the board to give us

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:23,360
feedback so the idea is that indeed we

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,000
have those individual members but we

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,440
need feedback from the market we have

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,870
companies providing services providing

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,909
support and they of course have a

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:34,549
completely different scope and a much

00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:36,620
better overview of their area and so we

00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:38,509
wanted something where we would benefit

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,820
from where we would get inside and how

00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:43,970
things work how the Board's decision pan

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,559
out for them how liberal is developing

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,169
per se and that's what the advisory

00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:50,779
board is for so it's indeed dedicated to

00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:53,000
companies and organizations it's not for

00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:54,200
anybody else and they either have a

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,879
direct connection to Libre Office

00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,610
because they provide service they

00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:02,059
provide support or a long experience

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:05,059
would floss so they have experience they

00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:08,330
can advise on general topics and that

00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:10,490
per se is based on sponsorship so that's

00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,889
one way for TDF of getting some

00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:17,480
additional sponsoring currently we have

00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:19,970
16 members and there is one meeting that

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,289
we have a quarter with the Advisory

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,889
Board where we share what we've been

00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:26,149
doing or we show some statistics some

00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:31,100
upcoming projects and ask for the

00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:34,700
feedback and we prepare slides and those

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,379
slides departed that can be tacked on

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,809
confidentially a share with our members

00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:43,460
and this is actually a rather important

00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:45,649
thing because it pans to all TDF so TDF

00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,590
is what i would describe public by

00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:51,409
default that's also anchored in the

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:56,360
statutes what we have done is first of

00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:59,000
all to apply a 1/3 rule that on maximum

00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,710
of 1/3 members of the board and 1/3

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,929
members of the Membership Committee can

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,710
have the same affiliation so you cannot

00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,390
have board members all from the same com

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,460
honey because that would easily create a

00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,110
conflict of interest that's in the

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,940
statutes and the statutes even foresee

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,830
that should people get elected in a way

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,630
that you have more than one thought they

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:18,539
can be removed they actually have to be

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:21,480
removed so that's hard in the statutes

00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:23,309
that was important to us and then you

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,690
remember this the small title from the

00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:28,110
beginning that openness and transparency

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,570
are key for us so public by default that

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,850
means per se all the board meetings are

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,260
in public the ceiling to the wiki page

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,929
where the minutes and decisions are

00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,700
shown similar all decisions taken

00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:41,490
outside of regular meetings for example

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,799
my email are public we even go a step

00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,870
further and make the accounting public

00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,640
so you get really nice ledges to see

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,110
where money comes from how it is spent

00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,080
you can even see what's in the bank

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:54,049
account it's completely public and the

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,120
boards discussion mailing list is public

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:59,820
now of course there is a certain limit

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,460
to that because you don't want to make

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,080
the full legislature you see individual

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,850
names and what they have donated that's

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,470
not going to fly

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,779
of course we do have decisions in the

00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,549
board that are limited that cannot be

00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:13,500
made public or cannot be immediately

00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:15,450
made public there are some things for

00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,919
example but when it comes to contractors

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:20,340
that you rather don't want to make

00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:22,110
public on the other hand if a new

00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,940
advisory board member is showing up and

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,980
is talking to the board of getting

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,929
approved and the marketing is prepared

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,760
for that moment we don't make the

00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:31,590
decision public because that would of

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,720
course you know dilute a bit the

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:37,049
marketing message but as soon as the

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,640
news is out the complete vote on that

00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,799
and and who was in a meeting and when

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,690
the decision was taken is made public in

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,659
the statutes actually foresee that we

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,669
can take private decisions but as soon

00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,080
as they confidentially is not there

00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:52,289
anymore they have to be made public

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,120
afterwards so you will every once in a

00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:56,460
while see some decisions made public

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,169
that have been taken before because

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,240
that's actually in accordance with the

00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:02,880
statutes that's mandated and enforced by

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,039
the statutes so by that we try to make

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,500
things as public as possible to the

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,990
extent that is possible

00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,899
keeping in mind certain limitations may

00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:17,720
exist for example privacy reasons but

00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:17,720
per se everything at TDF is power

00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:24,580
so where do we stand with that what what

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:29,320
have we achieved so far were disinterred

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:30,700
he of course we do have libre office and

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,610
I'm not gonna tell you in detail what it

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,340
is because I assumed everybody knows but

00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:39,670
you see two things in there that relate

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:42,010
actually to the statutes supporting

00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:44,320
multiple platforms is within the light

00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:47,770
of we want to reach as many people as

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,110
possible available for use by anyone

00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,790
free of charge

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,220
the second thing here more than a

00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,290
hundred languages that's the same goal

00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,030
we want to reach out and make the

00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:00,220
software the documentation the help

00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:03,190
system the websites and so on available

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:05,560
in as many languages as possible in

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:09,910
order to reach as many people as

00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:12,070
possible and that is with the with the

00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:14,050
keyword of digital participation so we

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,520
want to include those people and there

00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,260
are numerous countries and I think those

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,440
of you active and open-source projects

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,240
will know that that won't really speak

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,130
English that well that's not their their

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,990
mother tongue and it's not really the

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,910
language to learn at school so the

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,830
assumption that everybody to some degree

00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:32,200
speaks English is for many countries

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,880
completely wrong for example from Brazil

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,710
I've learned many of the younger

00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,410
generation do but the older they don't

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:41,410
it's it's simply not their language so

00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:43,390
we try to aim although English is the

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:45,820
common denominator that we have to speak

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:48,190
because most people do that actually we

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,140
try to have as wide as outreach as

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,910
possible and localize in as many

00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,650
languages as possible in line with the

00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,690
statutes that what we do should be

00:25:53,650 --> 00:26:01,150
usable by by as many people as possible

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:02,830
and what we do is that we have two major

00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,720
releases per years we run at a

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,160
time-based release that actually is not

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,790
in the statute it's just a matter of

00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,210
fact and so on and so on so that's

00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:15,840
that's the primary thing you see from

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:18,599
CDF

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,460
what's rather new and that's something

00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,399
done primarily by the commercial

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:27,599
ecosystem around is the libreoffice

00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:30,929
online so a version a set of packages to

00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:33,809
deploy to run libreoffice in your local

00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:35,879
browser if you have any any recent any

00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:39,599
modern browser you can run it you can

00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:43,169
broken documents it uses existing share

00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,869
and authentication systems to make the

00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:48,599
user management to store the data it

00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:51,179
provides multiple users to edit so you

00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:53,940
can use collaborative editing the

00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,919
important thing that we planned from the

00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,289
beginning is that the same rendering is

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,940
used than the desk abrasion so your

00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:01,559
document should ideally look the very

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,719
same because the same rendering engine

00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:06,149
is behind that and that is indeed

00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:09,359
primarily driven by one of the

00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:11,009
commercial ecosystem participants and of

00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,960
course in light of free software with

00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:16,080
the source code made available in public

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,549
would you see here below is the link for

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,609
the docker container where you can

00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:24,379
download all that and see for testing

00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:26,639
purposes and that's radda radda new and

00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:29,039
primarily targeted for the enterprise

00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:31,710
market of course but it's something

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,379
within the libre office ecosystem that

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,749
has been released and I think quite

00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:40,349
quite well and quite a while ago already

00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:42,330
we published a viewer for Android where

00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:44,039
can view documents and that already

00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,769
features at least an experimental

00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:49,830
editing mode so that's all the effort of

00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:55,409
this disc elaborated working we are the

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:58,229
bound to one more thing that came to

00:27:55,409 --> 00:28:02,879
life over the course of TDF and i think

00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:05,369
in 2014 it's the so called document

00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:08,190
liberation project the similarity of the

00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:10,080
logo is not a coincidence so the

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,989
document liberation project was

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,759
something that primarily existed already

00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:18,749
in libre office we had lots of filters

00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:21,390
and then they were basically thought

00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:24,540
into a separate package and

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,800
the main goal is that also in life with

00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,380
the statutes with access to your

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:31,860
documents open data open standards that

00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,090
old proprietary formats mainly from old

00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,180
software that is not on the market

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:40,230
anymore and legacy file formats that you

00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:42,900
can report them that you can open them

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,480
in LibreOffice and convert things

00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,730
convert things to the open document

00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,160
format so it provides one means

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:52,140
especially for legacy documents to be

00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,660
converted into all the oven essentially

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,720
gives you access to your documents to

00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:00,600
your data and convert it into an open

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,940
standard and that has indeed been made

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,610
primarily by volunteers they have been

00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,080
working on that they have the idea of

00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:09,390
putting it into a separate package and

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,440
not only in the Liebherr of the source

00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:14,880
code and that is an official TDF project

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,130
that is not so much visible to the

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,970
outside because it's more developer

00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:22,950
centric less and user centric and what

00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,930
makes us quite proudest this library is

00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,450
used by many other open source projects

00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,860
so it turned into a combined effort

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:32,490
completely in light of TDF submission

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,050
PDFs goals TDF statutes and that's I

00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:37,140
think a very good sign so one project

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:39,210
that completely was created out of what

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:43,580
we had was put in a separate project

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,580
called document Liberation project

00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:50,310
there's much more and if you're eager to

00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:53,160
see in an all area speed budget be legal

00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:55,530
bid events be a development website

00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:59,130
infrastructure we do have a really nice

00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:03,000
and a report that is around 40 40 pages

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:05,670
and per se that was a legal obligation

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,800
that we had at being a foundation the

00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,690
authorities asked please once a year

00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:13,200
send us what you've been doing so we see

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:16,350
you actually do something and we turned

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,770
that legal obligation into a benefit by

00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,910
not just providing the mandatory German

00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,580
version to the authorities here in

00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:26,580
Berlin but rather getting it translated

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,770
getting input in a in a nice layout at

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,110
version getting it printed illustrated

00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,970
with graphics with pictures and it gives

00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,160
a perfect over youm for us it's each

00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,290
year amazing

00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,080
because several countries especially

00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,160
those who have problems with speaking

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,100
English they're not interacting

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:45,650
regularly with with tvf english-speaking

00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,180
TDF so at least once a year you ask

00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,590
people what have you been doing what is

00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,970
going on in your region

00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,160
what are you suffering from what

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,720
successes did you made and they give you

00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,240
that feedback and for that that's quite

00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,160
touching each year to read that what is

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,710
going on what all those communities are

00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:04,700
running and we do have both versions

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:08,420
available for download and the 2017

00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:10,430
version is scheduled later this quarter

00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,170
so we are in the finalizing bits of the

00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,540
layout in process and then you get

00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,130
information on what we have done the

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:21,620
past year and the plans for the next

00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:24,110
year are vast and probably most hard

00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:27,530
part is what is the future like and it's

00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,480
hard to answer that there is no big road

00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:31,910
map that we have like for the next 10

00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,370
years with what deadlines and such it's

00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,650
more based on meritocracy that you

00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:38,530
decide so if you join TDF if you join

00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,510
our effort speed as a member or a

00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,190
regular community member that is not a

00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,960
Board of Trustee that doesn't make so

00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,630
much difference in that regard you can

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,340
decide you can steer the ship so of

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,830
course there are some ideas there are

00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,650
some plans but there is no officially

00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:56,720
TDF roadmap because we're an open-source

00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,940
project and we have people contributing

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,630
and they should decide where are things

00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:06,140
heading just a couple of things that

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,510
recently took place on rice bits in the

00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,820
project is first of all the Membership

00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,650
Committee that I've mentioned is due for

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,200
reelection this summer they will be in

00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:17,180
charge I think in September October so

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,380
that will start soon if your member of

00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:23,720
TDF consider running for a seat then we

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,250
have recently published the results of

00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:30,320
one of the tenders that were funded by

00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:32,660
TDF in terms of accessibility and a new

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,210
hub system is place since libre office

00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:37,880
6.0 where the help has put in a much

00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,920
more modern way in the browser and if

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,890
I'm not mistaken with Libre Office 6.1

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,720
from this HTML help there will also be

00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,490
an offline version so that's complete

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,019
change in the approach for the help

00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,359
system

00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:52,669
we will have our annual gathering the

00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:55,129
conference in Tirana this year and

00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:57,499
September definitely recommend going

00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:59,779
there it's it's an amazing event and of

00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:01,729
course just always a way of getting in

00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:03,649
touch so if you have any proposal if you

00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:06,559
have any idea any requests for funding

00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:09,080
we do have a dedicated forum for that or

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,749
send an email to the board discuss list

00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,820
or to the info address send any proposal

00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:16,190
send in your plans your questions we're

00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:20,720
open and that's exactly what you should

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:22,789
make use of so to encourage you a bit

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,039
now that I've talked a lot about TDF and

00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:26,450
how we are set up and how did the

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,259
philosophy behind that and what the

00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:32,059
statutes foresee just invitation to join

00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:34,399
us so this is a group picture that we

00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:37,789
had at the annual conference in Brno one

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,979
and a half years ago and it's like in

00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:42,379
many open-source project it's just just

00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:44,749
fun it's really incredible having people

00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:46,970
and friends around the world and working

00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:48,919
together and jointly completely

00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,059
independent from what people do for a

00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:51,529
living or what the professional

00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:53,570
background is what age they are that is

00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,759
really completely overcoming all those

00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,669
artificial artificial borders that we're

00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:01,970
seeing so I definitely can recommend

00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:04,970
joining and because I said Esther the

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,830
group picture we had in Brno and the

00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:09,139
next conference will be in Albania I've

00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:11,599
been there just three weeks ago and

00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:13,819
really lovely place it's not the nearest

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,960
spot to flyby but it's definitely worth

00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:16,879
the trip and I'm pretty sure the

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,149
conference will be quite exciting as

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,149
well and with that I hope we're quite

00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:25,750
good on time if I'm not mistaken yeah it

00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:29,089
looks good so if you have any questions

00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:31,069
either here or by email I'm around for

00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:33,679
the rest of the day well firstly maybe

00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,290
you think Florian and I will come for

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,559
questions

00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:40,559
[Applause]

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:51,000
with regard to your statutes

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,480
did you write anything about open

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,300
licenses in it I didn't catch anything

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,130
there and one of the reasons I asked is

00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,040
that California at the moment is looking

00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:05,730
at writing a proposal for a voting

00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:10,400
software to be a free and open source

00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:13,680
and it's very difficult to write robust

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,980
future-looking definitions for open

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,450
source in the statute

00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,070
so to recap I think the question was

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,280
what do we have anything with regards to

00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:25,680
licenses in the statute so we do not

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,140
mention explicitly one license but there

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,450
is I think really more for sentence will

00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,100
be described what free Libre and open

00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:34,110
source software is we basically covered

00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:37,740
all the terms that open standards matter

00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:39,800
so we described the licenses that could

00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,720
regard that's a description that we give

00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,990
but there is no concrete license

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,070
mentioned so we do have some flexibility

00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:49,770
especially with regards to you can

00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:52,170
hardly change what's in there but it

00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:54,090
must be freely broadband source software

00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:57,630
open standards so the description is

00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:59,970
quite extensive and if you go to a

00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:01,710
website we do have both the determine

00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:04,770
version as well as a translated English

00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,660
version online so I think that the first

00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:09,900
one or two pages are really describing

00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,850
all that we do in will without

00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,310
explicitly mentioning a license or a

00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:16,980
product but still setting the frame with

00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:21,330
him so we are forced to stay within an

00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:30,660
open license indeed do we have more

00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:33,630
questions as far as I have heard this

00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:36,000
initiative came from the former star

00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:39,090
office folks in Hamburg to create this

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,820
foundation it is true and as I have seen

00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:48,450
now people that contribute are from all

00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:51,300
over the world I is there any special

00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:54,780
German group there are anymore in the

00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,780
foundation already spread completely so

00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,910
the question was what a first of all

00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,280
it's true that the initiative for TDF

00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,200
came primarily from former some

00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,109
employees and where there was a special

00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,869
focus on Germany with regards to people

00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:12,150
active so the initiative came from a

00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:14,490
variety of people it was it was not

00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:18,270
really spoken out but we have been

00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:20,190
working in this project for four ages

00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:22,470
already and when we had that the last

00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,030
official Open Office or conference it

00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,800
was really like in every corner you

00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,599
could hear foundation foundation

00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,020
relations people had the same idea but

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,730
it was really a completely mixed group

00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,430
would put many many volunteers and many

00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,170
more volunteers join in the first days

00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:39,510
so did the answer to that but it's

00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:42,690
primarily from former employees is a

00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:46,500
clear no it was group effort indeed

00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:48,000
primarily driven obviously from from the

00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,359
volunteers because they were in a

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,119
different position and of course and

00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:57,420
what we got to Germany there is still we

00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,950
do have many of the former people

00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,170
working on the OpenOffice or code base

00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,760
now with other companies still working

00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:06,150
for liberal office and they historically

00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,980
have been primarily in Hamburg and of

00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,260
course there's a certain focus when it

00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,780
comes to administrative bits as they are

00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,150
in German obviously but otherwise we

00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:17,430
really completely distributed so there

00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:20,700
is we try to keep that focus as as small

00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,940
as possible because we don't see us as a

00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:26,369
German foundation that the seed is

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,079
completely independent so it's we have

00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:30,599
to have a local seed and as a foundation

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,960
we can't leave Berlin that's a specialty

00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:35,970
of the regulations but in the end I'd

00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,650
say we're virtual so there there is a

00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:40,710
seed but anything else happens online

00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:48,000
and it's not really tied to a specific

00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:50,849
country or city so thank you Florian

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,450
again and we will meet at 2 o'clock as

00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:56,100
planned please have lunch right now

00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:58,160
thanks a lot to enjoy a meal

00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,160
