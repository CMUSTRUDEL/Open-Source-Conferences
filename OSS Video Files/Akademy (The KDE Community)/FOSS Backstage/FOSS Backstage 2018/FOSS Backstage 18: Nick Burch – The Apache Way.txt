Title: FOSS Backstage 18: Nick Burch â€“ The Apache Way
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Apache, that's just the webserver right? No? Oh, what about Apache Hadoop, Apache Lucene, Apache Flink, Apache Mesos. Oh yes! But what's the Apache thing all about, and why does it matter?

The "Apache Way" is the process by which Apache Software Foundation projects are managed. It has evolved over many years and has produced over 100 highly successful open source projects. But what is it and how does it work?

In this session we'll discover how an Apache project is (and isn't!) managed. We will see how the foundation provides a technical and legal infrastructure for each project, and how the Apache Way provides the governance scaffolding for individual projects. This provides the framework for Apache projects which are then free to apply the Apache Way to ensure their project succeeds.

Having attended this session you will have a better understanding of the inner workings of both the foundation and its projects. With this understanding you will be better equipped to engage with and benefit from Apache projects.
