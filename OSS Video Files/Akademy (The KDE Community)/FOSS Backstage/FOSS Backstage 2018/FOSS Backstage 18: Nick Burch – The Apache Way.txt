Title: FOSS Backstage 18: Nick Burch â€“ The Apache Way
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Apache, that's just the webserver right? No? Oh, what about Apache Hadoop, Apache Lucene, Apache Flink, Apache Mesos. Oh yes! But what's the Apache thing all about, and why does it matter?

The "Apache Way" is the process by which Apache Software Foundation projects are managed. It has evolved over many years and has produced over 100 highly successful open source projects. But what is it and how does it work?

In this session we'll discover how an Apache project is (and isn't!) managed. We will see how the foundation provides a technical and legal infrastructure for each project, and how the Apache Way provides the governance scaffolding for individual projects. This provides the framework for Apache projects which are then free to apply the Apache Way to ensure their project succeeds.

Having attended this session you will have a better understanding of the inner workings of both the foundation and its projects. With this understanding you will be better equipped to engage with and benefit from Apache projects.

	00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:18,420
the Apache way is the name that we the

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,550
Apache Software Foundation give to the

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,270
least worst way we have discovered of

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:28,610
developing open source software and it

00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:31,439
is not a single monolithic view it has

00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,690
divergent some disagreement and a lot of

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,660
history as to why it's ended up as it

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,829
has and I'm hoping that our lovely panel

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,320
here from Greybeards two key new people

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,890
will give us a bit of an insight into

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:51,359
what it is how it works why it's great

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,429
and sometimes how its failed so could I

00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,629
please ask the panel to give a very

00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:59,399
brief intro about who you all are and

00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:05,309
quickly if possible how you got involved

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:08,310
in our fun little merry band so hi I'm

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,610
Isabel currently on the board of

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,240
directors was a towers of people it took

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:18,060
two minutes after I was elected for a

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,980
little meme to come up because I was

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,030
insisting that I'm just one of nine

00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:27,810
people not the one person I came to

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,810
Apache like when I was at university as

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,050
part of notch you probably don't

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,280
remember not unless you're involved back

00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:40,200
then I was working together with the

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,710
Whizzer project together was my research

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,810
group working on something called C not

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,340
distributed file system today you may

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,670
better know that as he had hoped

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,070
distributed file system at some point I

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,030
created the conference right here after

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:59,480
said someone was crazy enough to elect

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,400
me and to be a member of the foundation

00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,920
like I believe two years ago this

00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,819
gentleman who was there suggested that I

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,390
become a board member and that's how I

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,340
got deeper and deeper into it

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,560
my name is Shane Carew and I currently

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,359
serve as the vice chairman of the board

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,810
of directors along with Isabel in and in

00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:21,959
another

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,180
seven directors besides us I got

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,640
involved in Apache in 1999 because my

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,040
day job essentially gave a bunch of code

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,590
to Apache and that was our day job to do

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,569
that when my day job of course changed

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,530
direction as companies sometimes often

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:40,650
do I stayed involved at a lower level it

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,959
was a free time and that got noticed I

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,239
went to Apache con I made the mistake at

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,500
Apache con one year following this guy

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,120
in knew and said hey where are you going

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,480
work or no planning meeting can I come

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,820
and he said sure now I was young and

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,350
that was my mistake that I went to a

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,090
planning meeting voluntarily and I left

00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,430
three hours later being completely

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,010
overwhelmed and having tasks to do for

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,700
the next Apache con so that was how I

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,530
was recognized voted in as a member kept

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,569
working on organizing how we work

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,310
internally sort of the Apache way for

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,950
how the corporate side works not just

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,140
the project sides and gotten to the

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,640
board and it's been a very very long

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:23,370
train since then but enjoyable hello my

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,579
name is Lara West and I've been involved

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,459
with Apache not with the ASF but with

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:32,579
the Apache web server basically since

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,079
1995 as far as member I became a member

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,709
of at that time the ax Patrick whoop

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:40,799
like in 96 around 96 so basically

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,780
happened with the SF since the very very

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,370
beginning the reason how I got involved

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,380
with the Pat she is at that time I was

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,180
still a student I was asked by a German

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,910
publisher to write a book about Apache

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,190
because they realized hey this new open

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,049
thought thing is really really important

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,060
we need more books about that so they're

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,100
looking for people to write about the

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,019
various open source software what is

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,720
Linux Apache and then they approached me

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,060
I said yes and then I spent a lot of

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,120
time while obviously writing the book

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,430
and finding bugs in Apache submitting

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,530
lots and lots of bug reports and at some

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,510
point I guess they got annoyed but all

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,160
the bug reports and said okay you have

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,380
commit access now please go ahead and

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,810
fix your own bugs and commit your own

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,210
patches it looks ok so that's how I got

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:31,560
involved with with Apache and the ASF in

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,550
general yeah hi my name is Christopher

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,360
dots

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:39,240
yeah I'm not quite as involved as long

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,370
as the the other is before me but I just

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,910
had a look at when my first contact with

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:49,500
the ASF was and it was sort of 2001 with

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:51,210
a patchy cocoon project yeah I'll never

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,610
forget that one day when there was a new

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,560
cocoon release and there was a Thank You

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,500
Christopher that's for reporting this

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,780
bug that was totally totally awesome and

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,669
then it took about I think it was eight

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,060
years or so that I was sort of a

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:09,020
drive-by committer sort of you you use

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:13,050
stuff and you sort of fire patches at

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:17,099
hundreds of projects but then when

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:20,970
Apache Conan's in time was I had a few

00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:23,940
beers at the hotel bar with just about

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:27,120
that part yeah yeah yeah and yeah well

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:32,009
that's when I sort of lost control of my

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,470
free time yeah and well sort of

00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:37,800
when you start committing to one project

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,139
that doesn't stay that way for quite for

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,860
very long sort of got dragged deeper and

00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,810
deeper into it

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,030
my name is Braille I'm definitely

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,550
the youngest Apache member on the stage

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,909
probably the youngest one in the room I

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,580
just got voted in this this year

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:58,380
actually I'm also the chair of Apache

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,199
finner Act and that's how I got into

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:05,810
Apache Apache for interact started in

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,949
incue bation in December of 2015 and

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,509
exactly at the same time I got hired by

00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:13,349
a company that was contributing code to

00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:15,150
that and in order to increase their

00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:18,199
capacity to contribute code to that and

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,250
I very quickly became very interested

00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,750
following the incubator list following

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:28,560
the processes the way it works and yeah

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:31,560
the rest is history and Here I am okay

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,150
thanks so one of the things that we say

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,639
at Apache that can be a bit confusing to

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,150
new people is if it didn't happen on the

00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,219
list

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,139
it didn't happen does someone want to

00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,370
say a little bit about why we came up

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,900
with that role and what we're trying to

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:47,810
protect with our communities by it

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:51,170
I'll go so if it if it didn't happen on

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,570
list means if if the dis the decision of

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,270
we're gonna do X or not do X or the vote

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,310
and and the process by which we reach

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,050
that decision didn't happen on one of

00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,340
our mailing lists where you send them

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,620
you subscribe to send a mail opposed to

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,440
everyone we archive every single mailing

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,880
list permanently on our own servers so

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,960
we have complete control everything

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,540
that's ever been set on a mailing list

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,060
Apache we should have a copy of that's

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,680
valuable because in the future when we

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,480
want to argue about something we can go

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,160
back go back and say here's what the

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,420
decision was right not just the code

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,180
that ended up in there not just the

00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,210
commit log that said oh I fixed X why do

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,760
we fix X why did we do it this way all

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,740
that process is still there so not only

00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,480
is it valuable for us who were older

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,150
contributors to remember why we did that

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,040
it can train new people who could say oh

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,080
that's why this project goes that truck

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,390
that's why this project Y mahute uses

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,400
this logo because well in the earlier

00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,320
talk session they had a very very very

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,510
very long discussion about the bad logo

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,480
and it was sort of nobody would make a

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,310
new logo and somebody just checked it in

00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,680
but now you can see the process so you

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,350
can always understand the history of how

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,030
a project got to where it is because it

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,770
happened on the list it didn't happen on

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:04,640
a list and how do we know it actually

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:06,320
happened yeah just to add to that I

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,300
think one important part is the the

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,450
archiving of the lists so if we go to

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,920
Apache and look at look look look for

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,590
the Apache mail archives you find

00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,700
literally everything and from the

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,170
various mail is from the various

00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,330
projects obviously if you also have the

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,740
some internal mailing list foundation

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,420
mailing list where we do the very same

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,540
we have a mailing list and we have an

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,030
archive I think it's to some extent the

00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,690
reason why we choose mail is it's

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:34,070
universal everyone has an email address

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,979
it works and every device it works

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:39,860
everywhere you don't have to discuss

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:42,410
like do we use slack - we use I don't

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,060
know whatsapp do we use something else

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,440
and there's no real discussion about

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,660
that because it just works everywhere

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,070
and it's a bit the history initially in

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:53,990
I don't know 1995 or 1994 when when the

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,550
patchy was started it was basically

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,150
through a mailing list where people got

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,339
together and started exchanging pad

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,380
at that time you didn't have all these

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,450
like various instant messaging services

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,820
that exists today so meaningless was

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,190
kind of like the the best choice at that

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,560
time and in my opinion it still is the

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,200
the best choice because it works across

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,060
time zones it's not an instant messaging

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,339
thing in that sense so you don't have to

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,140
be there for when a discussion happens

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,600
you can go back you can so contribute

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,490
even if it's a day later or a few hours

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,410
later or even a week later depending on

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,850
what the discussion is about I do agree

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,160
that it's best choice but it also brings

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:37,230
problems with it that some of our new

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,240
contributors often struggle with so we

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,430
all know information overload today and

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,870
it's only getting worse and when you

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,880
subscribe to an apache mailing list

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,040
you're subscribing to a significant

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,290
amount of email that you think you then

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,750
have to work how work out how to filter

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,550
and how to how to categorize how to

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,250
decide what to respond to and what not

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:59,279
to respond to it's a skill that you have

00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,709
to learn when you get into Apache to to

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:06,029
handle this volume of mail and at the

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:10,260
same time it's no longer as modern and

00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:14,600
cool as it was when I was in college the

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:17,550
Millennials today don't like email and

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,190
they when you say here we're going to do

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,959
asynchronous communication sometimes it

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,350
requires some convincing and sometimes

00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,940
we fail at convincing people to come and

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,770
join in this asynchronous method of

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:34,860
communication so while it is necessary

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,910
and important for a global working to

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,500
have a form of asynchronous

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,180
communication and email is old enough

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,000
and proven enough to be the superior

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,760
system for this it's not without some

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,010
problems so there's two points that I

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,410
would like to add last you've given just

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,709
describing how we use mailing lists and

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,560
how we archives us when I explain the

00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:58,380
maybe focus on mailing lists I usually

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,860
explain that what you want is an archive

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:04,110
which you can search which is stable the

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,570
URLs so if you reference the discussion

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,360
later in time since URL stays stable

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,310
through time and which is linkable so

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,230
you can share

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,350
Lync was everyone else and what's also

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,120
important for Apache is that it's public

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,700
so everyone who's using your project can

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,710
follow along can see what's happening

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,180
referencing back to what the nice sets

00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,890
this morning open sources about

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,510
transparency so you want to make

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,360
transparent what you're working on what

00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:31,580
your plans are what you want to do next

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,880
and where you need help and there's also

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:38,300
for me ties into the Apache Way where we

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,510
try to recruit our commuters and our

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:44,270
developers from the user community so

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,910
when I explained Apache to people who

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:49,850
are not yet opens those people I tend to

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,529
tell them that Sirius is saying like

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,640
patches welcome and that's typically a

00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:57,980
help request so working on a mailing

00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,670
list means making transparent where you

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,830
need help

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,839
it makes transparent where as a project

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,490
is supposed to be going and from a

00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,080
user's perspective it gives me the

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,779
transparency into the project and it

00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,339
makes it easy for me to participate if

00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:12,770
you have all this design just

00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:15,290
discussions and decision making

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:17,330
processes behind closed doors I cannot

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,700
participate I cannot become active I

00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:23,690
cannot become one of you're one of you

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:27,140
so you cannot recruit me in and you

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:31,310
cannot share the workload with me or

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:33,200
with you and another thing that sort of

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,320
felt really strange in the beginning was

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,589
sort of when we meet at an Apache con

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,480
usually several committers of the same

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,970
project are at the same place and you

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,620
well you tend to discuss things of your

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:52,010
project and in order to make it possible

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,750
to keep the others in the loop it felt

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,060
sort of strange in the beginning so if

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,970
you were discussing some technical

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,400
things at a conference to sort of write

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:04,010
a summary of what you were discussing to

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,900
keep the others on board if for example

00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,180
I'll just take the the project I'm

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,060
currently working on we have one guy

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,970
living in Sydney one guy living in

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,010
Florida the one guy for example me

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:19,000
living in Frankfurt and it's really hard

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:22,040
if you have a synchronous communication

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,240
stream it's hard to get them all out of

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,240
bed at the same time

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:33,230
okay so touching on that we often say a

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:38,740
minimum of 72 hours for any decision and

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:43,160
why is that one is to cross time zones

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:45,230
and weekends and public holidays one is

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,820
that many of these people are working on

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,190
these projects on an on and off pieces

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:53,570
you cannot expect someone to mirror a

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:55,610
mailing list on a 24/7 basis and and the

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,260
weekends and time zones and the fact

00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,480
that I contribute during the week

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,070
because I haven't have the time many

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,150
people contribute on the weekend because

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,220
they don't have the time from their day

00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,020
job so you need to understand the

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,810
abilities of all the commuters across

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,110
the project we've also got in at Pinner

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,460
act we have a couple of committers in

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,170
cameroon in the english-speaking part of

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,280
cameroon I don't know if you guys have

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,250
been following the news but they don't

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,660
have power so they have to drive over to

00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,420
the french-speaking part of camera and

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,400
to get internet access so we generally

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,370
give them a little more than 72 hours to

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:31,280
make it possible for them to also to

00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,600
contribute I guess if you want to make

00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,310
sure that you always stay up to date of

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,810
what's happening in your project never

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,810
go on holiday for more than 72 hours

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,950
okay so one of the things in actually we

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,330
have is the plus one is the voting and

00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,320
sometimes when we get new projects in

00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:53,839
they try and vote on everything anyone

00:14:51,320 --> 00:15:02,450
want to talk about voting voting in

00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:05,780
moderation and consensus oh it's it's so

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:08,450
the some projects are adamantly against

00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,280
voting and use it as a very specific

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,500
tool is when we can't come to consensus

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,730
and we can't sort of talk through okay

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,550
this is good enough and nobody will

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,890
object to this even if it's not perfect

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:21,710
then okay we're stuck we'll vote and

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,420
they hate it and they say it's bad but

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,520
they use it and then we have a vote and

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,530
then at least the decision is made so

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,390
the progress as a whole and the roadmap

00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,540
can continue whatever way the decision

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:35,240
went we have other projects who like

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,750
voting for everything and if that fits

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,700
their model

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,740
I think it's fine as long as the

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,150
community is you know well documented

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,830
and they make it clear that that's how

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,430
they do things because at least then you

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:49,410
can you can it feels easier to show

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,880
direct consensus that way I don't think

00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,850
it's necessary but some people like to

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,920
do it yeah I think like you were talking

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,680
about voting however the plus one minus

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,600
one thing is not just about voting yes

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,000
it's it's obviously used in boats it's

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,040
sometimes more about showing consensus

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,600
or showing agreement to something so in

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,880
many cases I've seen people obviously

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,770
using this I'm many familiar with the

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,660
Apache web server project some projects

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,540
may do this in a different way but on

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,520
the web server - at least if you say

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,250
something or propose something people

00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,540
will say plus one or minus one simply

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,880
because it's the shortest way to just

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,770
say yes I agree with you but you but

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,570
what you've just said it's just showing

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,430
agreement not necessarily no official

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:35,010
boat so I think that there's a

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:37,920
difference than some things that wasn't

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:40,650
mentioned so far you said it's not only

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,540
that you can vote with a plasma plus one

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,270
you can also vote with silence

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,570
so you can call a lazy consensus vote

00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,980
and that means you don't have to reply

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,839
by default directory was what was

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,830
communicated so you don't have to hit

00:16:51,839 --> 00:17:00,570
reply enter a an answer let's just go

00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:03,030
ahead and maybe while showing consensus

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,040
by just adding a plus one that might be

00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,410
an official vote or just a sort of a

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,660
technical discussion however if you

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,910
disagree just writing minus one and

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,120
nothing else that's typically not

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,880
treated as a good form so we usually

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,670
expect if somebody disagrees well he can

00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,530
write minus one but it's expected to

00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:25,530
sort of give a little reasoning just

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:29,190
just I don't agree is sort of not good

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:30,930
style yeah that's that's very true and

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,330
very important especially when someone

00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,910
proposes a patch and you say minus one I

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,470
don't like this at the very least you

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,970
should point out the parts that you

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,400
don't like or the parts where you see a

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,600
technical problem that's usually

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,720
straightforward when it comes to the

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,820
technical patch or maybe you even fix

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,620
the things that you think need fixing or

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,450
need to be different as I

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,330
- one on that but here's a modified

00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,430
version of that how like that's that's a

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,470
better option maybe and then people may

00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,860
vote on this so say a plus one minus one

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:04,230
so yeah we're not super formal with her

00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,059
voting though and sometimes we do the

00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,190
rules pretty ad-hoc like for example in

00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,710
FINRA actually wanted to accept a new

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,600
code into it that I had been working on

00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,340
so much of it had been done off list

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,460
which it shouldn't have been done I

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,960
asked for a two-thirds vote which

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,880
there's no rule anywhere that says it

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,110
has to be a two-thirds vote but I asked

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,270
for two-thirds vote because I've wanted

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:28,350
to make sure a lot of people were on

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:32,100
board I've wanted to get that extra

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:36,300
level of approval and so voting isn't

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:38,960
always just like 50% you win 49% you

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,520
lose sometimes it's also a map a way of

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:46,980
involving people in the decision-making

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,990
process a little more so one question we

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,210
often get from new companies getting

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,730
involved in Apache for the first time is

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:57,750
who do I pay for a seat on the board and

00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:04,110
who do I pay to make this happen and yes

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:07,559
as you see we all giggle why why do we

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,850
say no to their money in that way what

00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:13,590
are we trying to prevent what are we

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:16,520
trying to do instead because we're

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:20,100
independent of commercial influence I

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,260
mean that's because so a fundamental

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,840
part of the Apache brand both is what we

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,000
as members all feel internally as well

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,550
as part of the value to contributors for

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,020
coming to us is that our board is made

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,050
up of independent members of the

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,940
foundation who have been elected

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:37,830
internally so it's not like it's just a

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,840
self-selecting board who sort of slowly

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,660
moves it's it's people who have shown

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,040
merit across the six hundred members who

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,530
are all very senior people in the

00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,330
technical world so there's it's I don't

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,950
say it's a competitive but it's people

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,080
who really really want to be here and

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,140
people who are really well respected by

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,880
this broad base appears who believe in

00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,220
this mission and we want to make

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,050
software for the public good which is

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,870
different from what aboard one company

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:07,100
wants when they want to buy as he

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:09,020
and has happened several times that sort

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,890
of well let's say the interests of a

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:15,320
certain company sort of was

00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:17,510
contradicting the well the needs of the

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,970
community and sort of try to influence

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:24,980
that and the Apache Software Foundation

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:27,320
has proven to show what do you say in

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:31,040
English as show your teeth and sort of

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,380
well get rid of that influencing problem

00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,510
I would like to turn that around a

00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,030
little bit you don't pay the foundation

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:41,120
you pay your employees and they sent pay

00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:43,340
to the foundation it was time someone

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,960
also translated it to paying was time

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,580
and love you stay around you stick

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,340
around and that's how you gain influence

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,570
so it doesn't mean that people here do

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,240
that on their wall on to your time

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,730
unpaid say typically are paid by their

00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,090
employers and trust me it's a good way

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:03,410
to keep employees happy within your

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:06,170
workforce one one thing I've actually

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:09,340
seen quite a bit in the in the history

00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:11,990
of the ASF is that once I mean because

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,120
membership is for individuals only you

00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,680
cannot become a member as a company

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,720
there's no pay to play a kind of thing

00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,900
which is what Denise mentioned this this

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,240
morning but I've seen many cases where

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,730
someone was initially paid to contribute

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,760
to a project but even after leaving that

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:31,280
company for whatever reason continued to

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,810
contribute or continued to contribute to

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,510
the foundation in general or to other

00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:37,510
projects so that's a fairly common thing

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,400
how many of these people do we have any

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,400
audience

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,160
[Music]

00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,990
just a little history note I mean the

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,840
start of the ASF was all about

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,520
self-directed altruism the reason why we

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,710
did what we're doing is because we

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,150
needed a web server and the person who

00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,130
was running the web server and creating

00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,080
the web server went away it wasn't

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,700
because this wasn't a school project it

00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,040
wasn't something we were doing because

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,380
we just wanted to we had jobs and

00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,610
responsibilities based on that so from

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,660
the very very beginning there's always

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:36,280
been this quite very tight line between

00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,050
doing things for passion but also doing

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:43,179
things because they need to get done and

00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:44,559
because your job depends on it Denise

00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:47,050
introduced the term this morning of a

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,870
duoc recei so you can pay your employees

00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:53,620
to do and if they're doing then they can

00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:57,220
influence and that's that's the only way

00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:59,080
you have in really and I'll just add one

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,870
one quick note so the Apache Software

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,640
Foundation is a u.s. 501 C 3 public

00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:06,100
charity it's a corporation we file an

00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,710
annual tax return we don't we don't pay

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,179
taxes we store the file in u.s. we we

00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:12,730
have officers and directors we have a

00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:14,740
formal annual meeting of shareholders so

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,740
that's part of what we're talking about

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:20,530
as directors or as members running the

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,179
foundation paying our contractors the

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,380
other part of Apache which is probably

00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:25,870
what most people are familiar with is

00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,960
the projects right every single project

00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:32,230
has this model of voting and merit and

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,000
so on so a lot of the there's there's a

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,400
very obvious way to show from your

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,630
company's duoc recei paying your

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,800
employees because then you get the

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,110
better web server that your company

00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,760
wants to do something else with it's a

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,490
little bit different model when you're

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,380
you're paying an apache member to work

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,780
on the corporate things so that's sort

00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,460
of an interesting topic of long term

00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,320
sustainability of how we do that and how

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,510
we make sure we have enough members who

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,190
can act independently and have time to

00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:59,000
do all the legal bits and the paperwork

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:02,780
that have nothing to do with code

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,130
okay looking at a lawyer in the front

00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,610
row I think I should ask question about

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:10,670
our license and how it's different

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:15,190
so without inviting or igniting a giant

00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:18,440
flame war can we get a potted history on

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:20,540
why we've chosen to go down the route we

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,420
have with our license and why we're not

00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:26,270
so keen on letting incubating projects

00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,950
combine incompatible ones and just that

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,050
maybe a little bit on the history of the

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,210
license itself initially when the web

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,790
server was created it was based on the

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:38,260
NCSA web server which came with the

00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:40,730
bsd-style license it was open source so

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,260
the Apache guys at that time

00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,710
Jim was involved at that time basically

00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,000
it took that NCSA code and included

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,000
their own patches and it eventually

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,110
called it Apache and and they simply

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,990
kept the license

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:56,330
it became the apache license but it was

00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,070
still a bsd-style license and only with

00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,080
the as the news explained in her talk

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:03,110
this morning with with the creation of

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,390
the ASF with the foundation it became

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,190
the second version of the license which

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,970
included the intellectual property

00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:13,670
related details and and all that and one

00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,620
thing a lot of people I've been talking

00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,930
to recently sort of we're a little

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,230
confused about because if you for

00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:23,240
example take the GPL license which sort

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,180
of well you can use this piece of

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,910
software for free but you have to make

00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:32,960
the product you built with this software

00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:34,790
free to because they thought that well

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,100
if you just give it away for free and

00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:40,010
don't have any of this copy left

00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,050
restriction on it everything good that

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,020
happens with this piece of software will

00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:48,260
be sort of some corporate property and

00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,940
not given back but looking back the last

00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,220
few years what's happening in the Big

00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,100
Data sector and stuff like that it's all

00:25:52,220 --> 00:26:01,820
Apache licensed and it's growing and

00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:04,010
growing and growing so hmm so it doesn't

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,890
more common in terms of GPL I I believe

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,560
that obviously there are many use cases

00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:12,830
where the GPL makes sense however I

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,390
strongly believe that if the patch

00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:17,000
group at that time would have chosen the

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:18,919
GPL for the webserver I'm not sure we

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,370
would have the SF today that's what is

00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,240
my opinion yeah I think so you're

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,240
talking a little bit about the

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,820
motivation behind the license and part

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,010
of it is rooted in the altruism in that

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,320
we want to be a universal donor for

00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,269
anyone so anyone who wants to take our

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,649
software and use it great anyone will

00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:37,220
take our software and modify it and use

00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:38,779
it great

00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,570
anyone who is taking our software modify

00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:44,480
it and then give that away to anyone

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:46,429
else that's great we wanted to be able

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,620
to make sure that there's maximum

00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:50,120
freedom for users of our software at any

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,159
level of distribution in the future

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,809
now of course somebody along the way you

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,090
can take the derivative project and then

00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:57,200
make a proprietary version out of it

00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,330
okay that's fine I mean it'd be nice if

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,159
you did it publicly but that's fine

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,620
we've still given stuff away to all the

00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:06,769
other people along the way so we believe

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:11,090
in maximum freedom for users is most

00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:13,130
important for our model I cannot answer

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,230
the question on behalf of CAS F I can

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:18,169
only answer it on behalf of myself when

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,880
I started a project at CAS F I remember

00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,320
going through documentation from the

00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,669
Free Software Foundation and from the

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,490
Free Software Foundation Europe and

00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:27,470
they've got a matrix of which license

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,260
should you apply given what you want to

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,419
achieve in the market and a apache

00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:34,250
license is quite great if you want to

00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:37,279
break into existing markets if you want

00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:39,529
to push towards a standard with your

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:44,929
technology and I think then Apache is a

00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:46,580
great way and just one tidbit the apache

00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,919
license is one of the very few

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,990
open-source licenses that explicitly

00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:53,360
adds a disclaimer for trademarks which

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,559
is not technically necessary but i think

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,480
is a very friendly thing to do because

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,120
open-source licenses are of course

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,960
copyright licenses and none of them

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,029
grant you trade about trademark rights

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,039
if you're a company that's got some code

00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:08,870
that they want to open-source and bring

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:14,800
to the foundation what do they need to

00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:16,770
do come to I talk tomorrow

00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,440
just tonight we'll be talking about

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:22,090
bringing the project in right over there

00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,770
by the way we'll be talking about

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:29,920
bringing projects into the Apache

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:32,220
Software Foundation via incubation what

00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:37,240
you do is first you find a champion

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:39,370
write a proposal and the new goes

00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:43,090
through the process of practicing being

00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:46,140
a community scrubbing your IP making

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:48,820
releases that are appropriately licensed

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,530
and then if you do that long enough

00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,560
successfully enough then you can become

00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:56,470
a top-level project that's the short

00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,670
version of it there's there's a lot of

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,070
details and we're gonna go into some of

00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,600
the details tomorrow so for some of the

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,700
details I would start that story a

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,170
little bit earlier you want to think

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,420
about why you want to come to your party

00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,740
do you only want the trademark what do

00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,780
you want to add up our way you're

00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,200
freaking and do you have the same goals

00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:16,570
that we have one things that I found

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,110
many projects straddles many of these

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:22,270
projects come from single developers or

00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:25,720
single companies having been developed

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:27,820
at a single company means that these

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,420
people had ultimate control over these

00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,460
projects a lot of these projects and a

00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,920
lot of these people struggle was giving

00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,230
up control as I mentioned earlier I

00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,930
started Apache mahute was in see Apaches

00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,910
of her foundation at some point someone

00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,130
came up hey I'm gonna read your book

00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,960
Apache project and I'm like wait a

00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:51,190
minute this is something that I wanted

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,950
to do I'm really jealous now except five

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,560
minutes later I realized I don't have

00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:59,290
time to do it but I do want this book to

00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,300
exist so I was really happy that someone

00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,250
took up the work and did that for me

00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,880
however it's this kind of thought

00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:09,610
process and this kind of letting letting

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,570
off control does take a little bit of

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:16,390
Education and I just take a little bit

00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:19,270
of trust those in your community and in

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:21,760
yourself so what helps for that is to

00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,940
understand why you went to Apache and

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,179
why you're going through all that and

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:30,110
maybe one of

00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:33,309
just recently I sort of saw one of the

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:36,889
big benefits of the the Apache Incubator

00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:39,110
process because I joined a project an

00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:42,080
incubator project I heard about that in

00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:43,999
Patrick on in Miami I was totally oh wow

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,090
this is a cool project I want to be part

00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:51,440
of this started contributing was invited

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:54,559
as one of the first committers in that

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,159
project outside of that one company the

00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:01,100
code was donated by and then a few

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,429
months later that company decided to

00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:07,340
well let's say shift their priorities

00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:09,440
and they sort of pulled their people off

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:13,009
the project so they no longer had the

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,440
time to work on it so now we have a

00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:17,990
project and that sort of hanging in the

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,960
air a little and that's sort of one of

00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:24,950
the reasons why we sort of ensure that a

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:28,249
project that is announced top level has

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:32,809
a very diverse a committer base that

00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:34,730
stuff like that doesn't happen I think

00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:38,210
one important thing with the SF is that

00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:41,330
we want to make sure that if there is a

00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:43,940
top level project that there is a

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:47,480
healthy community around it that if as a

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:50,330
as a user as a customer as a company

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,840
picking that framework software whatever

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,730
it is you can be sure that it will be

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,269
supported and there is some kind of

00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,740
support for for for the software and the

00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:02,570
incubator didn't exist in the very

00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,369
beginning of the ASF I forgot how long

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,679
it took when it was created I know

00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:10,100
looking at Jim but then if a couple

00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:12,350
years after the SF was created yeah so

00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:16,070
like two years later basically because

00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:19,309
we saw the need we wanted more project

00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,419
so there was a need for more project

00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:22,399
people were looking at different things

00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:24,590
wanted to do more stuff at the ASF and

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,999
we were like okay how do we set up these

00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:28,009
projects how do we make sure that all

00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:29,629
the new committers you cannot expect

00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:32,570
them from day one to understand how the

00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:35,149
Apache way works sometimes when it is a

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:37,070
contribution from a company you have to

00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:39,080
make sure that things like trademark

00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,740
details have been sorted out etc before

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,440
you actually

00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,320
make it a proper airsoft project that

00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,270
was the main reason why the incubator

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,600
was created what we have that period a

00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:54,170
project has to go through before it can

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:58,190
become a proper top-level project at at

00:32:54,170 --> 00:33:00,470
the NSF and and really really to go back

00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,000
to Isabella's point if you're thinking

00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,220
about coming to the incubator the most

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,050
important thing overall is what why

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,720
you're doing it but realize that if you

00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,010
bring a project to the incubator and it

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,440
succeeds and it becomes a top-level

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,780
project it is no longer your project it

00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,880
is a patchi's project in terms of

00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,250
illegal and Trademark sense and it is

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,980
that communities project in terms of an

00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,820
actual who does the work and that

00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:26,120
community will be an independent

00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:29,480
community which is a good thing but as I

00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,530
see both said not everybody understands

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,890
why it's a good thing until they've

00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:36,470
worked on it and there are cases where

00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,120
maybe you don't want to do that and say

00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:40,040
oh maybe projects that don't want to be

00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,809
an incubator and that is fine you just

00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:46,220
need to understand it before and you may

00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:47,809
need to make an informed decision okay

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,760
we've got a few minutes left so does

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,559
anyone in the audience want to ask a

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,770
question and can we steal one of the

00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,770
microphones

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,210
thank you thanks so much for talking

00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,149
about about this it was very interesting

00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:13,490
I'm the president of KDE v and KDE in

00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:16,099
many ways is very similar to Apache but

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:20,030
in at least one an important way very

00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:23,839
different you were talking about voting

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:27,049
and decision-making and forget EE the

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,049
mantra is who does the work decides and

00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:33,770
could you talk a bit about how that's

00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:35,839
different for sure well I guess one one

00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:38,030
one thing I think in terms of thinking

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,220
about how Apache works is the

00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:43,099
terminology so whoever does the work

00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,659
decides is whoever so some person who

00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:47,179
has written the code just gets to check

00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:49,369
it in that's different from the Apache

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:51,589
model where the best way to do it is to

00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:53,780
think of the community around this

00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,549
project it's going to decide on

00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,569
something so part of the incubation

00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:58,579
process is making sure we have a

00:34:56,569 --> 00:35:00,619
diversity right so if any company goes

00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:02,359
away if you know if you are sick for a

00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:04,730
month and you know you're on vacation

00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:06,049
that there's somebody else to continue

00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,480
the project so the first thing about

00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:10,609
Apaches difference is that we explicitly

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,960
have a community mindset and thus the

00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,640
community has to be involved in the

00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,619
decisions that's the I think the first

00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:21,109
difference yeah well and let's say in

00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:22,940
order to get a vote at Apache you have

00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:25,190
to do some work it doesn't have to be

00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,890
coding it can be sort of supporting

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,559
speaking at conferences and whatever but

00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:33,140
you have to do work in order to usually

00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,299
get the right to vote so I'd say it's

00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,819
not that different but just it's sort of

00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:41,299
the the merit you earn doesn't sort of

00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:44,299
expire so if you worked once really hard

00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:47,690
then maybe you're not you don't lose

00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:50,930
your vote I think it's also important

00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:54,319
that everybody in the community who is

00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:56,329
affected by decision get the opportunity

00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:58,069
to participate in that decision so in

00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:00,430
the case that I mentioned earlier we

00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:03,589
were bringing in code from the outside

00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:08,240
yeah if I as a duoc recei I could just

00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:09,680
say here code plump but everybody else I

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,530
was going to ask everybody else to help

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,210
me maintain that and so that wouldn't

00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:16,070
have been fair without it

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:21,200
listen Lee asking them will you help me

00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:22,700
maintain this code I think I want to

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,589
make one thing clear it sounds a little

00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:28,040
bit like we do a lot of voting at the

00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:29,960
NSF mailing list filled with plus ones

00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,950
and maybe some - once that's not really

00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,500
the case

00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:37,070
one terminology that that's been used at

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,270
the ASF is review then commit and commit

00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:41,210
then revenue which is basically

00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:42,680
depending which in which stage you're

00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,540
your development is or if you have a

00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,869
stable and a development branch or

00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,599
something

00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:49,540
typically the development branches

00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,770
commit and revenue so basically whoever

00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,650
implement something whoever gets the job

00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:57,440
done I can just commit that however if

00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,640
someone disagrees with that disagrees

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,080
typically means there's a technical

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,859
reason why there's something wrong with

00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:06,290
it then yeah either either patch provide

00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:08,780
a patch and fix the issue or in some

00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,750
cases it may mean that a commit has to

00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,880
be taken out again if it is

00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:15,530
controversial and needs actually examine

00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,839
the extreme case an official vote where

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,400
the community or the the PMC that the

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,050
project management committee actually

00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,780
doesn't officially board and say do we

00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:25,220
want this new feature or this new

00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,349
different direction this this code is

00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,540
going outside of the development

00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:31,040
projects it's the same it's not like we

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,619
vote on every little little bit

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,660
otherwise you wouldn't get anything done

00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:38,180
it is a to a large part of democracy

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,430
like if you have time to get something

00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,470
done that's great and unless it's a

00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:45,220
controversial thing everyone's usually

00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:50,930
happy that something got done

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:53,060
did we have any other questions we've

00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:59,030
time for one last question and one

00:37:53,060 --> 00:38:01,940
little answer quick point out that these

00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,680
faces and the faces of the hecklers will

00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,690
be around all of today and tomorrow so

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,730
if we don't get your question just just

00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,890
come find us we will if you're in Berlin

00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:12,670
I'm living here so you can catch me

00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,660
later after the conference as well Oh

00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:18,470
ask you later it's okay

00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:20,300
get some coffee you can you can always

00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:22,250
visit us in the Apache lounge you know

00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,980
we have free ice cream there so just in

00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,740
case you haven't noticed that yet it was

00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,510
another question yeah

00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,110
yes oh well I've not worked with the

00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:34,400
Apache foundation but in my experience

00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,870
working not without a foundation I've

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:42,710
seen that a lot of problems come from

00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:45,500
the way employers think so like with the

00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:48,470
incubator concept some employers will

00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:51,230
say well if you are an incubated project

00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:53,750
official project of some foundation we

00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:56,810
will not let you work there because it's

00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:59,630
not strategic enough for us or it's not

00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:02,480
there's not have enough visibility and

00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:04,640
another thing I've seen is that there is

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,770
kind of the expectation or misconception

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,160
that contributing to a community just

00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:12,590
means proposing and pushing some code

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,140
into a code base while obsoletes

00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,030
something very different I mean you need

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,040
to review other people's code build

00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:24,230
trust relationship with everyone and so

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:27,020
so my question is what does the Apache

00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:29,960
foundation Apaches of the foundation do

00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:32,750
to work with companies to kind of change

00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,910
the mentality into for employers to help

00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:39,020
people software engineers to actually

00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:42,770
work in a healthy way we're trying very

00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:44,450
hard to do this so what is the Patrick

00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:46,070
Software Foundation dude for this we

00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,190
have some very clear branding guidelines

00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:50,690
around our projects we projects report

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,240
the board quarterly so we can see if a

00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,560
specific project is unfairly treating

00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,220
new contributors from different places

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,480
but the foundation doesn't we don't go

00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,550
out to companies and say hey you want to

00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,920
work with us if there's company who

00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,420
wants to come great more portly it's

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,030
it's project communities if there's an

00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,800
interesting piece of technology that has

00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,880
a project community that you know wants

00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,940
to find new commanders they'll go out

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,740
and you know be useful so it's we we

00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:22,570
don't go looking for people people come

00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:25,910
to us and it's basically so be quick

00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:29,060
saying if a company doesn't want to pay

00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:30,170
the salary of a person to a full-time

00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,510
contribute to a project or even

00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,760
part-time it's unfortunately their

00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:37,220
choice if they haven't grasped the idea

00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,550
of open source if it's not really there

00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:43,330
within their strategy and

00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:45,190
unfortunately their right to do as an as

00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,140
an employee there maybe it's time to

00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:50,170
pick a different company who allows you

00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,840
to to contribute to open source I know

00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,940
that answers the question but okay

00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:58,350
unfortunately we're out of time so we

00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,350
have a big thank you to all of our panel

00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,940
thank you thank you to Nick for telling

00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,590
me about that I was gonna be on the

00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,230
panel at you know a whole day ahead of

00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:10,060
time this time thanks Nick so if you

00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:14,020
