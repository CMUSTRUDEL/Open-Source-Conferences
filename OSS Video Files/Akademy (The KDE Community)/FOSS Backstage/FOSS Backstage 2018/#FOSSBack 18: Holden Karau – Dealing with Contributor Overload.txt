Title: #FOSSBack 18: Holden Karau – Dealing with Contributor Overload
Publication date: 2018-06-21
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/dealing-contributor-overload

The first external person contributing to our project is amazing, but when that 1 snowballs to 1,000 life can get a little bit stressful. All of these fine lovely people want to help, but somehow no one seems to want to deal with code reviews, proposed documentation changes, or keeping your testing infrastructure alive, or maybe they just want to pull in different directions.

This talk explores what happens as a community grows and provides recommendations to organize your community. We’ll focus on how to control the fun chaos and how to build a development path that keeps your comitters engaged and your community growing. All of these are based on the speakers’ experiences in their own personal projects (which have much less than 1k contributors) as well as larger projects, like Apache Spark.

Come for the being told it’s not your fault, stay for the techniques to avoid pissing everyone off.

	00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:09,080
so yeah my name is Holden my preferred

00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,249
pronouns are shear her and it's tattooed

00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,940
on my wrist in case you or I forget

00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:16,940
morning's can be a little rough

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,100
sometimes and I'm a developer advocate

00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,720
at Google which is nice they pay me

00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,720
money I work on open source software

00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,930
yeah it's fun

00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,120
I'm on the spark PMC which is where a

00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,980
lot of this experience draws from but I

00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,149
also contribute to other projects and

00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,620
I'm on a few other PMC's and I also work

00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:39,949
on a lot of smaller projects that you

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,600
probably have not heard of very hipster

00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:42,019
and I've been at a bunch of other

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,480
companies

00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:47,539
besides Google I'm a co-author of two

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,550
books they are completely unrelated to

00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:53,899
today's talk but that should not stop

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:55,789
you from buying them in fact the second

00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,489
one is the first book where I realized

00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,729
you could negotiate contracts so that is

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:03,229
definitely the book that you should buy

00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:06,290
because I got a much better deal once I

00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,630
learned you could ask for things anyways

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,950
and you can follow me on Twitter and

00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,259
I've started doing code review live

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,979
streams as well and spark which I will

00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:19,119
talk more about as well in addition to I

00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:21,560
am professionally I'm trans queer

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,960
Canadian I live in America on a work

00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,880
visa which the kind of work needs that I

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,140
have they are currently debating as to

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,850
whether or not they wish to keep it and

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,860
that's just a really great feeling for

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,399
my life and part of the leather

00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:37,100
community and this is not directly

00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,780
related but I think it's important

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,729
especially for for those of you who care

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,619
about open-source communities to

00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,420
remember that people have all sorts of

00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,250
different backgrounds and we should try

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,409
and be inclusive of all of these people

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,649
and if we work together we can make

00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:53,119
really awesome stuff but if we don't do

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:54,439
that we chase away everyone who's

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,210
different from us and we'll just make

00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,280
the same old and we'll destroy the

00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,749
world with open-source software rather

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,850
than saving the world with open-source

00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:04,789
software I mean either way it will be

00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:08,270
open-source but I'd rather do good then

00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:10,820
light it all on fire my co-presenter

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,349
today is boo originally my coworker was

00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,599
going to come with me but on related

00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:16,879
notes she could not for immigration

00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,409
reasons so I just have blue mice

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,359
animal with me today she's very friendly

00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:25,069
she also uses she/her pronouns and she

00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:28,879
is the author of learning to bark and

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:31,069
high-performance barking currently

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,329
without a publisher for those two books

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,000
they're they're independently published

00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:36,950
but if you know of one looking to enter

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
into the dog related book market

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:43,069
definitely get in touch and her DMS are

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,730
probably open on Twitter although I

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:48,469
don't know if she knows how to read them

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,689
so I'm hoping you're all nice people you

00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:52,670
laughed at my kind of corny intro joke

00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:54,109
so that's that's a really good sign and

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,989
you probably care about open source you

00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:59,239
bothered to show up here so yeah thank

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:02,180
you and I'm really curious how many

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,870
people work on a project which is larger

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,299
than they really thought it was gonna be

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,769
okay that is a lot of people so this

00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:10,849
will hopefully be relevant to you and

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,519
for the rest of you who are not

00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:16,879
currently working on a project that is

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,970
overwhelming maybe this will be useful

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,599
to you in the future and you can sort of

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,919
nip some of these problems in the bud

00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,239
but before we get too far in talking

00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,620
about the things we can do to deal with

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,169
this I think it's really important to

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:35,030
remember it's totally okay not to fix

00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:37,190
this all a lot of us have a backlog of

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,959
change requests and support requests and

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,650
all of these other things that we really

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,720
want to get to but it's just too much

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,150
and that's okay you don't have to

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,729
accomplish everything that being said I

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,919
understand that that is a message that I

00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:55,479
have heard and then promptly ignored but

00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,859
I still think it's useful to repeat and

00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:02,329
yeah many of us wish we had more time to

00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:04,340
mentor folks but you know you can burn

00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:05,799
out on mentoring too it's not just code

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,659
that can burn you out

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,849
and so do not become like that very sad

00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,859
broken umbrella I like you as humans

00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:15,829
please continue to be lovely humans and

00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:17,359
not umbrellas okay so we're going to

00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:18,979
talk about what changes when when our

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,280
projects which is from like under 10

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:23,930
people to over a thousand people and how

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,250
this can make us feel kind of

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,289
overwhelmed we'll talk about a few

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,639
different community structures really

00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:30,620
quickly I assume people here are

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,479
relatively familiar with the ASF can

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,220
these structures but will I'll talk

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,530
about a little bit we'll talk about how

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,290
we can try and solve some community

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,270
challenges with Perl scripts but that

00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,190
not all community challenges can be

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,870
solved with Perl scripts sometimes we

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,139
have to deal with the fact that humans

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,449
are squishy and not programmable and

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,550
this is this is definitely biased sort

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:54,169
of towards the problems that developers

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,930
may feel more when they're trying to

00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,220
scale their community just because those

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,889
are the rules that I've had in these

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,470
projects which have exploded a lot more

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,539
than I thought they were going to and if

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:09,800
is there anyone who contributes to the

00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:11,900
SPARC project thank God okay cool so

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,610
ignore the bottom one and I am

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,289
definitely up to date on reviewing all

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:20,419
of the PRS foreshores okay the other way

00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:20,900
of looking at this is is our project on

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,570
fire

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,080
why is it on fire maybe we can make some

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,120
marshmallows with this fire oh maybe

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,199
maybe the marshmallows was not a great

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,710
thing to do we should have done

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,050
something else oh well maybe we can put

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:43,099
out the fire or not

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:44,870
either way it's ok oh ok so let's talk

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:47,270
about the fun of a small project right

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,500
like a lot of us like we we like are

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,720
working on a small project and we're

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,070
like Penn will be so amazing if I had a

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,620
whole bunch of people to come and help

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,470
me out this would be so cool but but be

00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,539
careful of what you wish for we have

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,820
often simpler communication and small

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,789
projects right there's more sort of

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,320
shared lore and it's easier to just

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:09,349
onboard new people slowly because they

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,300
will pick it up more easily often folks

00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:13,760
have more aligned goals right people

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,060
tend to agree on smaller projects a

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,070
little more and it the other one is it's

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,710
really often a lot easier to figure out

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,419
who you need to talk to and this can be

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,550
really challenging especially in ASF

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:27,740
projects where you have a whole bunch of

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,240
people who maybe committers but for

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,990
example if you come to me and ask me to

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:38,630
commit a sparks equal patch I'm gonna go

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:40,370
and know let me go find someone for you

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,599
and if you go into some of the other

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,340
people and you ask them to commit a

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,969
Python patch if you're lucky you'll say

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,769
let me go

00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:48,049
someone for you but they may just be

00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:50,599
like oh I should go find that person and

00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:53,269
then and then put that in their to-do

00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:56,299
list and then you never get a response

00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:59,839
to your email because humans and and the

00:06:56,299 --> 00:07:01,819
last one is so consensus voting many of

00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,860
us here may love it and it's a lot

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,239
easier to do consensus voting with small

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,059
projects because yeah I have like five

00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:10,129
people but when I have to have 20 people

00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:12,679
all agree that we want to go in the same

00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:15,409
direction this can get a lot harder and

00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:17,439
also with five people like you can often

00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:22,639
benevolent dictator for life can just

00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:27,769
work sort of but large projects other

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,989
people do our work for us yes people can

00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:31,999
be like yo your software is cool I use

00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:34,339
it sometimes this will make you happy

00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:37,369
sometimes people will use your software

00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:40,659
and make you sad you you got lots of

00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:43,849
different ideas and experience this is

00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:46,009
really only true if your project is not

00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:49,069
all just a large number of people

00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:51,110
exactly like you so if you're not seeing

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:53,419
a lot of diversity of viewpoints in your

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,329
project maybe maybe ask yourself why

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:58,129
that is and and the last one I think is

00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:00,259
really nice because I like money and I

00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:03,169
live in the Bay Area where housing is

00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:09,079
really expensive and I enjoy being able

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:11,779
to both live in a condo and eat food and

00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,939
so by being able to receive money for

00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:16,099
working on open source life gets a lot

00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,659
simpler and when I go to people I'm like

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:19,339
hey what's up I made this testing

00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:23,599
library you should pay me to work on it

00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:25,479
they're like no no but if I'm like hey

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,769
do you wanna pay me to work on this

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,089
project which like thousands of

00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:31,219
companies use they're like well that

00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:33,379
sounds like a smart business decision I

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:37,099
know how to business and then you

00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:38,809
receive money to be fair my

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,430
understanding of business is similar to

00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,029
that of the underpants gnomes so there

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,579
may be I'm glad to see South Park didn't

00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:49,430
make it over here so there may be some

00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:51,980
details that I'm missing out so okay

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,889
let's focus is our project on fire this

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,779
is the first question to ask maybe maybe

00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,329
all of these open PRS are gonna get

00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,459
merged

00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:02,129
quickly and it's totally fine and the

00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,559
the volume on the user list is high but

00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:06,899
totally manageable and it's not on fire

00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,699
maybe maybe it's just very bright so

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,369
what can we measure to see if our

00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:13,589
project is on fire we can look at the

00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:14,910
number of questions coming in and then

00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:17,519
we can look at the number of questions

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:21,839
being answered and if they start to

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,889
diverge a lot that that can be bad we

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,929
can start to look at the number of

00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:27,660
issues that are created and and also

00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:30,839
resolved or closed and we can look at

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,149
how old is the open pull requests are or

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,779
whichever form of accepting changes to

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:39,059
your project you do and there's there's

00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:41,850
a bunch of harder to measure things but

00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:45,600
they will come if the more easy to

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:48,949
measure things happen the diversity one

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,920
is not a guarantee but but please try

00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:55,920
yeah okay so maybe you look at this and

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,230
you're like yeah so last year we had a

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,970
hundred questions I answered 98 of them

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,249
and someone on the mailing list answer -

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,509
that was pretty great and this year we

00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:07,139
have a thousand questions I also

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:10,619
answered 98 of them and someone answered

00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:12,389
ten and there's a lot of people who just

00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:13,529
keep sending the same question to the

00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:17,699
mailing list because no one's answering

00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:19,799
them so maybe it is on fire yay so um I

00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,869
think that this fire comes from our

00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,149
classic pipeline of this theory that our

00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:26,339
users will become contributors and

00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:27,689
contributors can be developers or there

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,459
can be answering things on the mailing

00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:31,529
list and then our contributors will

00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,809
become committers and PMC members and so

00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:36,509
on and if any part of this pipeline

00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:39,350
stalls the previous parts of the

00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:42,449
pipeline will be impacted as well and

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,730
this is even if your pipeline doesn't

00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:46,679
stall if you have a sudden rush of

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:51,089
interest in your project like say for

00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:52,799
example glorious employer decides to

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:54,540
start putting marketing dollars behind

00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,419
your new fancy open-source thing and

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,790
then you get a whole bunch of new users

00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:01,709
even if you don't have a drop-off like I

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,309
mean we all have some drop-off but even

00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:07,160
if we have a relatively stable pipeline

00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:11,160
the sudden influx can just make things

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,839
explode - so yes at the start

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,550
our distribution is like the only people

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,170
working on the project are people who

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,899
can change it and they're also the only

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,629
users and this is a really great time

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,670
except it's kind of lonely and I like

00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:26,220
humans and if you don't this can be a

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,819
great place for your project to stay and

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,680
with slow growth if you have a way to

00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:33,720
turn your users and contributors and

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,310
committers this can go really well and

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,160
so this this sloth is just kind of

00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,110
slowly what was he along and slowly

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,670
become a contributor and some of them

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,800
will mosey some more and become

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:47,970
committers but with hyper growth we get

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,040
a bunch of users and then then maybe

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,040
they become contributors if you if you

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,170
put in a lot of work but then then you

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,569
have so many contributors and only a few

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:01,649
people to review these changes that they

00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:02,939
burn out and then your contributors see

00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,089
their code being submitted to your

00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:11,540
project and going nowhere and so they

00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:17,519
burn out and now you have sad users yay

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:19,800
not not yay ok the inverse of yay so but

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,019
I want to be clear there are many ways

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,079
for us to fail this is simply one of

00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,750
them we can all fail in our own unique

00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,790
exciting ways so it could be like

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,120
boiling a frog please don't try this at

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,889
home but your project can slowly get

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,759
into a bad state if people are slowly

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:40,800
burning out if your user to contributor

00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,870
pipeline stalls you'll probably start

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,420
seeing this in like question overload

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,769
but maybe not PR overload and so this

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,319
can be a good time when it's like oh hey

00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:52,170
I need to put in the effort to try and

00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:55,170
get more of our users to contribute and

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,790
either answering questions or coding if

00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:01,079
the contributor to committer pipeline

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:02,790
stalls you get so many PRS and then you

00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,949
just don't review them and so that's a

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,949
good time to try and fix that and if the

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:09,480
committer to management pipeline stalls

00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:11,730
and management is project management

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,250
committee or whatever system you use to

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:18,120
decide the people who are in charge of

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,529
running the circuits or whatever you

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,100
prefer to think of your open source

00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,100
project as

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,340
then then all of the other ones will

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,400
fail but like later so like that's like

00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,830
at least a good solid five weeks away

00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:40,260
and insert joke about CPU pipelining

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:45,810
here okay remember specter and meltdown

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:50,700
and pipelines okay this goes over a lot

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:52,380
better with C programmers okay so but

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,990
the marshmallows are delicious maybe

00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,850
maybe this all stalls but I'm a

00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,200
committer and because there's now like

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,030
five of us and there's a bunch of

00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,130
companies using it they're all willing

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,990
to pay us giant sums of money why would

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,910
I want to fix this problem maybe people

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,340
won't pay me giant sums of money anymore

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,730
I've become a replaceable cog again and

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:16,200
yes being a replaceable cog is

00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:20,640
unpleasant but a joy of capitalism that

00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:23,250
got too real um but even even if you are

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,220
making a lot of money as a result of an

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,290
inherently bad system you will burn out

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,600
because you will become overwhelmed and

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,390
then you won't make giant piles of money

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,750
anymore either and so either way this is

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:38,310
not sustainable um so okay what what can

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,490
we do to sort of address the first

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,380
problem right question overload and so

00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,840
the first thing is stop trying to answer

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,670
all of the individual questions right it

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,160
can be very natural especially if this

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,940
slowly ramps up to just be like every

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,500
morning I answer the questions and then

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,730
I'm done answering the questions and

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,060
then every morning it just takes more

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:02,070
and more of your time and eventually you

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,800
get afraid of opening your email client

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:08,370
and then you just stop and so don't do

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,670
that so one option is stack overflow

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,620
which is special and people have

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,690
opinions about it but you can you can

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,760
sometimes trick people with shiny

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,950
internet badges worth approximately zero

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,670
dollars to answer your questions for you

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:25,290
and this is cool but even even if you

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,420
decide that's not for you that the next

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,820
question is is your like mailing list a

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,190
google group is it easy for people to

00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,230
find the answers are they are they

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,870
searchable or are you seeing like a lot

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,260
of repeats because keep

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,210
can't find the answers to your questions

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:44,000
to their questions so summarizing

00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,460
frequent questions you can you can just

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,230
write document eight just write

00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,630
documentation sorry just writing

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:55,250
documentation is way more work than

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:58,610
writing the code at least for me and you

00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,870
can ask for help you you can go out to

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,100
the users who might not want to

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:05,720
contribute code and you can be like

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:07,400
listen I think you understand this

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,810
really well I think would be really

00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,330
great if you spent some time answering

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,250
some questions and like we could give

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,589
you this shiny little Internet badge of

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,570
like awesomeness and like then you can

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:20,450
use this to receive more money from a

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,640
hypothetical employer maybe and some

00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,800
people are like that sounds fun other

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,610
people you offer explicit incentives and

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,080
then you take away the fun so I don't

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:34,160
know if it's 5050 but good luck on that

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,920
and and the last one is filters so the

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,100
other one is if you're used to answering

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,570
all of the questions in your own project

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,029
just if you realize that other people

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:47,360
are helping now that's great

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:48,980
reduce the cognitive stress on you by

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,830
just filtering out the ones that are

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,690
going to be handled right just don't

00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,430
look at those and let other people take

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,110
care of them for you and don't get

00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:00,020
worried about it of course I say all of

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:05,870
this and I have 22,000 unread messages

00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:08,949
in my spark label so I could job me yeah

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:12,079
but on the plus side I don't read those

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:14,360
and and actually I do have filters that

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,819
pull out when someone is experiencing

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,339
like a very specific PI spark issue

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:22,220
around the things that I care about and

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,870
know that either I can fix or I can

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,610
answer more quickly than other people

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:29,330
and those are the ones that I actually

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:31,280
let into my inbox and at least

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,880
occasionally answer by in between

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,140
flights okay so longer term there are a

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,440
whole bunch of really cool things we can

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,480
do

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,940
improving discoverability for your

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,740
existing answers so take your take your

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,920
good answers from the mailing lists and

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,320
put them in the knowledge base or a wiki

00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,070
that you actually allow people to edit

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,450
um you know maybe index things rather

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,649
than slack

00:17:53,450 --> 00:18:00,649
I love slack but when I search on Google

00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:02,389
it doesn't show me slack history and

00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:04,880
then I don't I just go into slack and I

00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:06,559
ask the question again and that's bad

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,950
for me to do but it's it's just very

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,799
natural take time and explicitly look at

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,389
patterns I've tried doing clustering on

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,220
this and some some other commercial

00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:18,950
vendors have have done this where

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,509
they've done clustering on their support

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,269
questions and you can you can use this

00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:25,940
to trying to find sort of unexpected

00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:27,769
clumps of issues and then if you can see

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,820
something that you can address with code

00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:33,980
or even just with knots not just or with

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,470
better documentation you can do it there

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,559
too and the last one is you can try and

00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,870
trick people into creating courses or

00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,789
training material for your project

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,710
if anyone is interested in writing a

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,409
book about any of the projects I'm on I

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,179
am super happy to help you in a way

00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:55,639
which does not involve that much work

00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:57,620
from me definitely for you just want to

00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:59,330
be clear and thankfully I don't see the

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,909
people that I asked to be my co-authors

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:04,879
in the audience here so please don't

00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:07,669
don't share this with Trevor it will be

00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:11,120
an adventure unless he watches the

00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:14,629
recording he probably won't anyways um

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:19,549
so write a writing has terrible direct

00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:21,679
dollar sign return on investment if and

00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:23,090
and this is not always true but

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,860
generally speaking if you find someone

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,629
in you and you trick them into this you

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,309
should be upfront about what they're

00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:31,299
signing up for this may involve them

00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:34,549
walking away but you can be like listen

00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:40,279
the royalties may cover your coffee if

00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:42,710
you don't live in San Francisco and and

00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:45,769
that's good right coffee is a

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:49,190
substantial portion of my income but I

00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:51,919
live in San Francisco so it doesn't work

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,990
um but the indirect ROI can be pretty

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,759
amazing um and there can be this like

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,500
thing where you're like you know what no

00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,750
one understands my project quite as well

00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,820
as I do the solution to this is I will

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,540
write a book

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:09,820
and now now you have two projects to

00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:13,480
bring yourself out on and and that does

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,940
not go well I think if you want to do

00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,830
that definitely find other people to

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,220
work with and definitely find a

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:25,360
publisher who has a sort of more relaxed

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:28,620
attitude for example please do not do

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:33,460
this with pact they will make very

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:36,760
rushed decisions okay

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:39,940
yeah issue overload um so yes this is

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,030
our graph of our issues and purple is

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,100
resolved it's not going up that much but

00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:51,930
don't worry the number of created issues

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:55,060
is going up so that's good yes okay um

00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:57,130
great success so one of the things which

00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,840
i think is is pretty common especially

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:03,460
for projects like spark where we do a

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,530
mediocre job of managing our user list

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,090
as people are like well I tried asking

00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,910
on the user list and I didn't get an

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:14,220
answer the solution to this is to create

00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:18,220
a gira and well it's true some problems

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,920
should be reported as a juror not all of

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,540
them should be reported as a JIRA but

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,150
that being said the people who are going

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,410
to get that far into the process if you

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,480
can help them with answering their

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,250
question they're clearly willing to put

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,330
in more work and maybe you can trick

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:36,790
them into helping other people yes okay

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:42,100
I should probably stop saying trick um

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:45,580
convinced incentivize persuade that is a

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:48,130
much more positive word encourage okay

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,900
anyways whenever I say trick just just

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,780
hear other words and I will try and not

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,370
say it as much that that's totally works

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:58,480
right I can just give you a regex

00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:02,050
and you'll evaluate that as a human and

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,170
and the other one is lots of things

00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,640
can't and won't be fixed right there's

00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,320
pretty common things where people come

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,270
to us and they're like I made this new

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,760
machine learning algorithm I'm gonna

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:15,010
make an issue that's awesome and let's

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,930
let's fix this or alternative

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,270
I want this new machine learning

00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:22,240
algorithm of course I haven't made it

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:27,910
but that's what you do and in both of

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,740
those cases the answer is no and some

00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:35,650
people have some success with Auto

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:38,890
clothes this is a personal taste matter

00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:41,020
as to what sort of vibe you want your

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,090
project to have I think some people

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,820
react really negatively to Auto clothes

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:48,370
and you should definitely see how if you

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,590
do try it out in your project see how

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:53,920
your community responds and if it is

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,480
simply creating more like work than than

00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,790
actually saving and you just turn it off

00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:03,760
right magical tools are only useful when

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:05,560
they help us yeah um okay this

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,650
screenshot is old that is now I think

00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:14,680
400 ish but I chose this one because I

00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:16,450
like 386 sorry um anyways and I actually

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,460
like refreshed it a few times until I

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,540
got the right one so okay we can we can

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:25,060
have an overload on the number of PRS

00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,490
and how do people react to to

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,110
contributor spikes

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,410
people react in a few different ways and

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,000
I think most of them personally are bad

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:37,390
one of them is people are like oh my god

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,730
there are so many changes I just need to

00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:44,320
raise the bar on changes right and one

00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,200
of this is we can we can start rejecting

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,360
like small typo Corrections things that

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,370
we consider trivial often I see people

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,990
being like this is just a documentation

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:57,550
change I don't need it but it's like oh

00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:58,900
no no you need those changes some people

00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:01,000
are like you know what if we made our

00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,700
tooling more accessible to people more

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,710
people would use it so let's not make

00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:09,090
our tooling accessible because there's

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:12,070
already too many people and it's like

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:15,070
yes you will have a lower number here

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,570
but that is not actually your problem

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,240
your problem is not the number your

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,670
problem is that you're overwhelmed um

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,940
and the sort of counterintuitive

00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:27,250
approach is wow there are so many PRS

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,400
let's make it easier for people to do

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,140
this

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,470
because then I can can trick people

00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,780
let's persuade people into helping me

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,250
with the review and commit process and

00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,290
the last one is people look at this and

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,470
they're like I have a social problem I'm

00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:44,720
gonna write a Perl script or Python

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:50,650
script for those who were born more

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:55,820
recently and sometimes this can work

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:58,280
normally no okay so rejecting trivial or

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,610
irrelevant changes I think this is

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,870
really not good

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,520
personally if someone wants to make a

00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:08,030
lot of really small changes to the

00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,370
project that person is amazing and could

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:12,290
totally become a committer focused on

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:14,360
all of the little tiny small things that

00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:17,660
we need to fix and maybe they'll grow

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:20,210
later but like this person could take

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,880
care of so much for me right I would be

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,140
so excited to add them they're picking

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,500
the non-standard system to make it

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:30,760
harder I should avoid saying too much

00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:34,820
about that based on where I work and

00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:37,160
downsides of all of these the the the

00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,410
ones in red are worsens the issue

00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,880
overload so if we reject all of these

00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,490
changes we're just gonna have a lot of

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,440
open unresolved issues and people just

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,240
keep reopening them when we don't fix

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,580
them and the other one is if your

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,960
project is becoming big enough you can

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,060
put all of these sort of arbitrary

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,310
barriers in the road but it turns out

00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,670
that people like me enjoy eating food

00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:00,530
and working on open source software and

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,450
employers are like we must have people

00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,790
contributing to this project and then

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,830
they give you money and money overcomes

00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,630
all of your barriers by just making it

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,330
so that if I don't overcome your

00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:14,120
barriers I don't have food and this this

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:16,940
is not good because now the only people

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:20,480
you have are very determined and

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:22,640
probably a little pissed off and well

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,130
determined people are great you probably

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,740
don't want to have just kind of slightly

00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:31,010
pissed off contributors those are not a

00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:34,670
good State for them to be in doo doo doo

00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:38,960
what can we solve with Perl yay butts

00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:40,040
butts butts so if you if you don't

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,450
already have it

00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,520
deciding on style

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,730
and then creating automated tooling to

00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,429
support the linting making it faster to

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:54,960
merge and I think this is especially

00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:56,190
important for ASF projects or our

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,460
projects which may have like a

00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:02,220
public-facing repo and then another like

00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,350
actual source of truth repo where like

00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,030
traditional tooling doesn't work and you

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:11,010
have like a lot of steps to do merges

00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:12,059
just automate that stuff if you can one

00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,910
of the things that I love about our

00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:17,610
review scripts is it automatically looks

00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,679
at the change and then proposes a new PR

00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,600
title and it will show me the old PR

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,970
title and the new PR title before I hit

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,950
accept so I don't have to go in edit the

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,530
PR title go into my merge script and hit

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,240
merge it's just like hey this didn't cut

00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,010
quite match the style I applied a

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,350
regular expression to it just like I've

00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,700
asked you all to do and this is the

00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,580
result and then I go yeah that's what I

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,980
want and I hit yes and it's awesome and

00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,550
the other one is and I think this is

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:48,120
especially important for for growing new

00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:51,720
committers is having automated review

00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:56,070
mentions and admittedly I think this is

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,660
important but I don't do it so yeah but

00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,440
I'm going to try it's just not working

00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:04,140
yet for a sfm for specific details but

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,190
essentially what you want to do is you

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,559
want to make it so that people of

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,840
contributed code are encouraged to

00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,370
review but people don't often feel

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,010
comfortable reviewing code they're not

00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,650
familiar with well I'm more than willing

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,960
to do that most people don't seem to

00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,460
enjoy that experience but if someone

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,530
comes and changes code that they've

00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,600
written they're often more willing to

00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,010
take a look at it but they don't know

00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,870
that because they don't go and look at

00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,450
your PR review dashboard every day and

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,040
so you can use tooling to auto mention

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,170
to them that like hey there's this thing

00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,270
I think you'd be a great fit to look at

00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,820
it and then like they can be like oh

00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:42,990
yeah I I totally am and they can help

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:46,650
you out the other one is a PR review

00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:48,929
dashboard if you if you have like

00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,610
mailing list changes similar dashboard

00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:52,950
would probably be a lot more work to

00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,670
make but it's also really useful and the

00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,860
idea is that

00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:59,560
for a lot of projects we have many

00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,530
separate components inside of it and a

00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,900
lot of the people who even as like

00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,730
full-time committers may only be

00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,950
interested in small subsets of those

00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:11,050
right and this makes it really easy for

00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,420
me to go in and be like I care about

00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:15,310
Python today or I care about machine

00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,620
learning today and this is the part that

00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:20,530
I want to review and then I can also see

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:23,920
is this code in a state where it's gonna

00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:26,140
be ready for me to review it like is it

00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,050
passing ci or is it failing

00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:31,450
who else has taken a look at it and have

00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,560
they said it's good or bad right there

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:36,100
might be people who are not yet

00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,260
committers who say like this code is

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,820
good and then if I'm used to working

00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,190
with them I might be like oh yeah it's

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,170
probably really close I can just go take

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,970
a look at this and this will also be

00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,430
really useful for getting this person to

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,080
become a committer and so I think that

00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,660
this little dashboard is really cool

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,220
it's it's certainly not perfect and

00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,200
needs to be customized to each project

00:29:54,220 --> 00:30:01,060
but I think building something like this

00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:04,030
can help yeah but I really want to say

00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,680
even as much as these tools can help we

00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,040
fundamentally have a community problem

00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,650
at this point where we're overwhelmed

00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:15,460
we can't just by people more mottai or

00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:18,670
redbull we need to we need to scale the

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,130
number of people involved and and I

00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:24,610
think this is also really important is

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,930
to decide what we're not doing and this

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:29,170
is the example I mentioned with Auto

00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:31,540
closing issues SPARC is a lovely project

00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:34,230
with a lot of imperfections but one of

00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,610
the things which we've done an ok job is

00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,560
constructing road maps of our mission

00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,270
learning stuff specifically and it's

00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,710
like these are the things we are willing

00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:46,570
to do everything else probably not come

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,440
and talk to us before you write code

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:52,330
here and and the other part of this is

00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,670
if you're not going to do something with

00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:56,380
your project try and make it pluggable

00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,120
so people can still get their thing done

00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,680
and you don't have like three different

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,990
Forks of your project that are all

00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,840
slightly out of sync like we did with

00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,840
the kubernetes support spark

00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:11,899
that one didn't go so well we decided we

00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:13,009
weren't going to do a thing but with

00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:15,139
them we also decided that it was going

00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:17,029
to be way too hard to make it pluggable

00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,919
and so three different people all just

00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:22,580
decided you know what the solution to

00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:26,960
this is a fork and they were all right

00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:28,429
it was very unfortunate um Interac does

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,529
a good job of having like a really clear

00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:32,809
roadmap of what they're doing and also

00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:34,820
making it accessible it's it's in their

00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:36,049
github it's not hidden somewhere else

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,320
like you you get this when you're

00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:41,239
checking out the code our road map is

00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:45,229
not as discoverable for machine learning

00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:48,739
inside of SPARC and there's some notes

00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:53,269
about it in here you can see some

00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:55,489
examples okay the other one like we can

00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:57,200
try and take our like however many

00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:58,609
committers we have and and just make

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,629
them more productive with these tools

00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:04,549
but it's it's really not enough you're

00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:12,499
you're going to have to make it so that

00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:13,909
your committers are more feel less sorry

00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:17,299
 dammit

00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:19,759
okay the part that I wanted to say here

00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:21,710
and I screwed up is one of the things

00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,320
which I see happen with a lot of new

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,369
committers is that they get their

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,259
commitment and they're like this is

00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:29,539
amazing oh my god what about if I break

00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:30,859
the project everyone is gonna hate me

00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:32,509
they're gonna realize that I'm a

00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:35,719
complete fraud they're gonna take this

00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:39,229
away from me oh dear God oh dear God and

00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:42,649
just make it okay to break Master we

00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:45,830
have version control if you don't go get

00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:48,799
version control this is okay if you want

00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:50,869
to accidentally break the project

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,929
yourself to show people that it's okay

00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:58,609
to break the project that is okay it's

00:32:53,929 --> 00:33:00,169
not exactly lying and one person is

00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:03,440
except two people are excited about that

00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:05,119
and and just lead by example and when

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,729
they break the project don't yell at

00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,349
them be like cool let's see how to

00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:11,389
revert this and let's talk about why

00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:15,289
this may like broke the project and what

00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:19,180
we can do better next time more tests

00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:21,640
can also always help etc yay I'm

00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,970
fundamentally you probably need more

00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,080
committers if you're in the PR overload

00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,670
you can encourage people to become

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,420
interested in becoming committers by

00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:36,430
being like man being a committer so cool

00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:38,260
i go to these conferences yeah sometimes

00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:40,540
people will be like that sounds exciting

00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,740
I'd love to do that other times they're

00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,370
like I don't want to go to our

00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:47,380
conference no no and you can be like

00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,990
that's totally cool too don't you want

00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,700
to just be able to like make the project

00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,140
better faster without having to wait on

00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,910
other people and they're like yeah

00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,700
that does sound like a good thing I'm

00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,680
tired of waiting on other people and you

00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,790
know if these people are becoming

00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,560
committers there's a good chance that

00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:06,780
you have gotten to know some of their

00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:09,700
personality so tell your message to them

00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:13,960
evaluate how you pick committers I think

00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:16,030
this is challenging for us in the ASF

00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,290
sometimes consensus voting is a really

00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,660
great way to eat at the Cheesecake

00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:21,310
Factory and while I've only gotten food

00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,410
poisoning at the Cheesecake Factory once

00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,050
I do not want to eat at the Cheesecake

00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:29,350
Factory all that often

00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:31,810
and so if some people are consistently

00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:34,420
using their veto perhaps aggressively it

00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:38,050
can be a good time to be like hey do you

00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:40,030
like doing a lot of review work cuz I

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,830
want to share this with other people

00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:44,290
what can I do to make you more

00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:48,130
comfortable with sharing this with other

00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:50,980
people like these people want to help us

00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:52,540
um making guides for committers so that

00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,220
they can actually see how to become a

00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,590
committer right you might have

00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:59,680
contributors that just don't know how to

00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:02,230
move beyond that and mentoring people

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,910
that doesn't really scale but you can

00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,010
like mentor people and then you can be

00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,750
like and one of the great things that

00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:10,300
you get to do as a committer is mentor

00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,860
new committers and then then it's sort

00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,350
of scales it's like that bad pyramid

00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,430
marketing where we sell you makeup

00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:19,390
except I sell you open-source software

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:22,380
for free yes okay

00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:25,390
there are lots of ways to mentor people

00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,280
it's hard to scale it's hard to find

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,570
people really excited about mentoring if

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,710
you do hang on to them

00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:35,339
if you can't just drink a lot of Mota

00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:37,050
then mentor some people and then you

00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:39,480
need to move them on to effective

00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:42,450
committers I think one of the things

00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,400
which as much as we love the dev list

00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,750
sometimes it can be overwhelming and

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,060
scary for new committers because they

00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,820
are like oh no I must pretend that now I

00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,220
know everything oh god I can't ask what

00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,710
to do so so make it like hey it's ok to

00:35:53,220 --> 00:36:00,180
come and ask me a question it's totally

00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:02,430
ok and a lot of the mentoring stuff is

00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,730
about your own project as illustrated by

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:07,820
this thing that I clipped out of the ASF

00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,859
website mentoring a new committer

00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:15,930
here's the basics that are true across

00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:20,330
all Apache projects to do if anyone

00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:22,680
wants to fix that Paul requests welcome

00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,570
but more seriously I think this is very

00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,460
much a good indicator of the fact that

00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,160
as much as I can tell you mentoring is

00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:32,750
important it is all about communicating

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,750
the things specific to your project

00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,160
easier to contribute you can get new

00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,869
contributors they can become committers

00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,880
life is great

00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:44,580
reduce the overhead to contribute well

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,859
make it easier for people to make it not

00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:49,859
so hard for you good documentation about

00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:53,880
how to do this decisions are gonna get

00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:55,020
harder even with consensus voting you

00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,000
have this feeling of loss of control

00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,130
sometimes please you know be better

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,859
about that and technical things can

00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,930
explode but that's pretty much on you

00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:06,320
I'm not gonna be able to help you with

00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,550
that in the remaining three minutes

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,750
technical problems can often be fixed

00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:16,130
with technical solutions though so yeah

00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:21,210
wrapping up it's ok not to be perfect

00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:23,700
this is fine everything is fine yes the

00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:27,839
project is on fire but the marshmallows

00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,359
are delicious most importantly I have

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,970
this book it is unrelated to this talk

00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:35,940
but each book covers about a quarter of

00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:37,410
a cup of coffee in San Francisco and you

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,430
can help me from turning back to a life

00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:44,520
of enterprise support contracts and you

00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:46,350
can buy this book so with that oh yeah

00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:53,250
I'll be doing a bunch of

00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:55,920
yeah we're done okay if you can pretend

00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,990
to be excited for like 30 more seconds

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:09,630
there we go

00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:10,770
thank you so Christians okay so the

00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,960
question was if I could show the

00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,090
previous slide this is the previous

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,970
slide I'll be doing some livestream code

00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:19,740
reviews I'll do a code review today and

00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,660
some live coding tomorrow and I'll do

00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,280
office hours at a coffee shop nearby and

00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:34,980
if you want an excuse to go to New York

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:37,290
you come hang with me next week do you

00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,750
have any tips for dealing with entitled

00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:42,240
users that post on the mailing list and

00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:44,130
then a day later open an issue and then

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,930
a day later DM you on Twitter and then a

00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,580
day later have mailed your personal

00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,290
email address and you think might be

00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,540
about to turn up your house those kind

00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,880
of people that that really care but

00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:58,110
maybe you're getting a bit overwhelming

00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:01,650
yeah that's a really hard question to

00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:04,200
answer personally if someone shows up at

00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:06,120
my house that is probably the point

00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:12,480
where I would call my corporate security

00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:14,400
team and also let my neighbors know not

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,390
to let in people asking about

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,310
open-source software I really hope that

00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:22,050
the strange people that show up at my

00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:26,400
house just try to continue to sell me

00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:28,470
candy bars for the like Twitter teams

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,440
and stuff I normally I'm just like

00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:33,120
listen I would love to help you but it

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,880
just doesn't scale you need to go to the

00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,190
list I'm really sorry I just don't have

00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,720
the time and if they don't respond well

00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:44,400
with that then I blocked them deal with

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,620
that I don't like getting yelled at and

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,570
then it makes me not help the other

00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:53,760
people so what is your view on canned

00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:56,620
replies to common questions as opposed

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,260
to a personalized reply

00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,850
canned replies are amazing if people

00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,280
hate them

00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:06,880
then reconsider and write a better Perl

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,140
script for your kind replies I love your

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:14,800
advice thank you and I will subscribe to

00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:17,080
your newsletter yay thank thank you I am

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,380
I actually do have a newsletter it's at

00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:24,640
high performance part comm I think

00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:28,210
probably yeah you you can also follow me

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,700
on Twitter yeah oh yeah well I mean but

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:34,540
for the other fine folks in the room who

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:41,770
wish this high quality content of jokes

00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:44,680
about Perl it's pretty solid okay well

00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:46,890
then thank you very much we have a small

00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,210
