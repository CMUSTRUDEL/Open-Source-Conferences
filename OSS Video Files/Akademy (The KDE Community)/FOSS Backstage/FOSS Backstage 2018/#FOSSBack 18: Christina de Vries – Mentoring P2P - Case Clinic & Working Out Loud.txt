Title: #FOSSBack 18: Christina de Vries â€“ Mentoring P2P - Case Clinic & Working Out Loud
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	In a world strongly demanding self-organization and participation, there is an urgent need for mentoring ways that didn't originate in traditional HR or top-down approaches. Peer coaching methods will become the foundation of independent and self-paced advancement and will also facilitate networking within companies and even beyond.

I will introduce two techniques that are available for everyone, quickly realizable, and yet location- and equipment-independently usable - the Presencing Institute's "Case Clinic" and John Stepper's "Working Out Loud".

	00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:07,790
welcome good morning everybody and thank

00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:10,370
you for joining me

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,549
yeah this is what I will do I will talk

00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,799
about case cleaning and working out loud

00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:19,910
to open source mentoring techniques that

00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:22,970
may help you in your future now that you

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,490
know who I am I want to get a notion who

00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,130
you are so could you just raise a hand

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:32,329
who has been a mentee before or is a

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:35,329
mentee at the moment not so many okay

00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:37,520
and who has been a mentor before or is a

00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:42,380
mentor at the moment Oh even more that

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,180
is interesting well so when we think of

00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:49,010
mentoring we tend to think of mentoring

00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:51,860
as a magical process when somebody jumps

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:55,790
into the first mentoring they think

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:58,790
we've had somebody would just point the

00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:01,250
magic one at them and all the knowledge

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,980
all the experience just would flow

00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,250
through but of course that is not the

00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,950
case and mentoring is always a unique

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:14,149
opportunity to serve someone else and to

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:16,009
serve yourself as well so to lay the

00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:19,429
ground for the two mentoring tools that

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:21,350
I will show you today I have three

00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:23,630
truths about mentoring and one surprise

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,679
that I came across again and again over

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:29,479
the last two decades

00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:31,700
so truth number one of course everyone

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:35,030
can be a mentor it doesn't have to be

00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,819
the most valuable professional or the

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,770
most published author everyone can be a

00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:41,060
mentor so if you look at the person next

00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,999
to you right now

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,399
they could be your mentor and you could

00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:49,069
be theirs everyone has a unique

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,490
perspective and something to share that

00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:55,009
you don't know truth number two

00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:59,060
mentoring isn't necessarily about the

00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:02,209
what so if you want to proceed to

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,490
advance in development and coding or

00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:08,920
something you do not need to ask another

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:12,230
developer you may ask an artist how they

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,959
won't manage to proceed in their

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,450
advancement so it can also be about the

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,660
how and of course mentoring can

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,720
be about the houl and the when and the

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:28,220
best cases it's also about the why why

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,349
are you going to do this truth number

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,540
three you'll never be done being a

00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:35,720
mentee because times change of course

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,209
and there's so much to learn for you all

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,370
your life long so why should we stop

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,800
doing this and why should we stop

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,799
passing along the knowledge and the

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,549
ideas and inspiration so of course you

00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:51,489
should always be a mentor as well so the

00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:55,040
one surprise I brought to you is

00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:58,760
mentoring can also be done in 70 minutes

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,730
and they also is in italics because this

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,709
is not the only solution there is a wide

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,920
range of mentoring techniques and

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:09,650
possibilities but there is also the

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,040
opportunity to do mentoring in just that

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:15,440
short amount of time so the first

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,400
question you would have to ask yourself

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:23,799
is what is your exact mentoring need so

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:27,980
do you have an idea for your advancement

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:32,120
is it a new orientation do you need some

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,850
some feedback for this and some company

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,280
for the way so an ongoing mentoring

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,850
method would be the choice for you but

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,280
is it something specific right now is it

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:47,180
a question is it a current problem is it

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,489
a situation you feel stuck in so in a

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,239
top mentoring method would be something

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:57,440
that could suit you best so let's look

00:03:53,239 --> 00:04:00,680
at this one first so your open source

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,389
often one is the ad-hoc mentoring method

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,870
with the case clinic from the presencing

00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:09,139
Institute which I'd say works like a

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,540
strong espresso for exact this moment

00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:14,239
where you need it

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:17,959
the presencing Institute has launched

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:22,039
the you lab with the MIT and when I

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:25,160
joined in 2015 the second new lab on the

00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:28,310
EDX platform I got to learn about the

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,420
case clinic during this course of the U

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:34,210
lab which takes eight weeks or longer

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,700
you get to know several tools and one

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,100
tool was the case clinic where complete

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:43,810
strangers we're set up in coaching

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:46,210
circles in mind where one from Brazil

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,580
one from Cyprus and one from one so we

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,970
were four people spread all over the

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,120
world and one

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:58,240
yeah just jumped into the first case and

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,190
it is a case giver that you need the

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,830
others are coaches in that moment and

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,410
you proceed through seven steps then and

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,800
the case giver presents the problem and

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,740
the others just listen and then you do

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,950
not jump into this idea of quick

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,760
solutions that we tend to have when

00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:21,850
someone raises an issue but you think

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,130
about you reflect and you for example

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,560
paint a picture or something that

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,590
resonates with you and then the coaches

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,500
start to talk about what came to their

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:37,450
mind and the case giver is only

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:39,550
listening in this moment about how the

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,910
others think about the issue think about

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,820
this person's involvement in the issue

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,980
and possible solutions and that is very

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,830
interesting because you get a deeper

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:53,860
level of understanding and a deeper

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,540
connection because although we were

00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:00,670
complete strangers we could provide a

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,920
really valuable solutions for the case

00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:07,750
giver that was really interesting for me

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:10,660
that this worked so 45 people 70 minutes

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:15,760
and maybe a problem is solved that you

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:17,740
couldn't solve yourself today the the

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,800
case clinic is available online with the

00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,320
timer tool so you have the seven steps

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,230
you have an overview how much time is

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,870
there left what is supposed to happen in

00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:31,420
that step and what I like very much

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:35,140
about it is then that when the timer is

00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,670
done it doesn't give you ring so you can

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,220
just proceed when you're in the middle

00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:42,460
of something it won't interrupt you and

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,360
then you go from step to step until you

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,580
come to the closing

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,919
remarks by the case giver and the

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:55,849
thank-you note and the timer tool guides

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:59,120
you through all this process if you need

00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:01,129
to dive deeper into a case clinic and

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,379
maybe also a theory you and the you lab

00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,840
there are introductory videos like this

00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:08,810
one with Adam and Otto from the

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,319
presencing Institute at the MIT

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,270
there are also printouts available the

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,289
case clinic is there in English as well

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:21,440
as German and so you can decide in the

00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:24,050
group whether you just put it on the

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,460
table and go through the sheets or if

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:31,909
you choose the timer tool to get into

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:38,050
the procedure so why should you try this

00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:41,270
out it can be your mentoring tool when

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,279
you have something you think about and

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,979
you need help with that is specific and

00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,550
that is happening at the moment and you

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:52,819
should be part of the problem meaning

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:56,569
you are into it and you should be able

00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:59,659
to be a part of the solution if you try

00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:02,509
it you have insights with relevance you

00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,949
have the opportunity to really grab that

00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,789
chance

00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:11,180
it is very simple and lightweight no

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:15,529
more resources needed and it's of course

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:19,909
free and open source and if you have a

00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:22,750
mentoring need that is not something for

00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:26,180
just a moment if you have a question or

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:29,629
an idea for your advancement that asks

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,390
for more guidance over time then the

00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:35,510
second open-source mentoring option

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:38,120
might be yours and this is 12 weeks

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,370
working out loud by John stepper and if

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,010
we think of the case clinic as the

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,010
strongest presser for right now working

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:49,519
out loud is more like the tea ceremony

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,980
that endures over time that has several

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,300
steps that need to be followed and the

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,740
steps are a bit smaller maybe and yeah

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,850
the way is part

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:05,960
of the solution so my first working out

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:09,890
loud circle was very small we started

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:14,720
with only 345 people as usual even more

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,730
are well manageable and we had totally

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,310
different goals you come to the working

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,550
out loud circle with your personal goal

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:25,310
where do I want to go what do I want to

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,370
do so these are the question people come

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:33,140
with and have ideas what they are going

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:37,280
to to do are going to learn or whatever

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:40,610
you name it and we went from week to

00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:47,450
week with the 12 weeks guides you have

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:50,900
one for every week and we get deeper and

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:53,810
deeper into it and by week five I think

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:58,700
we were able to just go with the flow we

00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:03,370
were really arrived in that idea and we

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:08,150
started switching exercises we started

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:11,000
skipping some and we also paused and

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:14,840
said okay let's stop with this week we

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,180
just sit in a coffee shop sit down in a

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,520
coffee shop and chat a bit about what's

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:23,150
going on at the moment and that was

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,780
worth the time of course so if you look

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:29,360
at working out loud you may find the

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:33,860
website regardless come when you of

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:38,590
course have a lot of information the

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:44,360
introductions TED talk by John of course

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,830
some charts for example like this five

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,590
elements of working out loud which

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:52,040
accord to it it's about the mindset it's

00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:54,830
about networking and sharing and this is

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:59,120
what the circle guide looks like for in

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:02,960
this case we gate so you have suggestion

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,870
for the agenda you have time boxed parts

00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:10,010
in there and then you go through the

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:14,090
exercises or as I said you can skip them

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:17,450
and because of the weekly hour you spent

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:20,900
together this is 60 minutes per week at

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:23,720
least it's supposed to be the group

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,910
grows together and you get to know each

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,160
other better and yourself of course and

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:31,160
he grow your network within the group

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,990
and beyond because this is part of

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,710
working out loud

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,720
I asked John why he would think that

00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,440
working out loud is perfect for

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,360
peer-to-peer mentoring and he said that

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,940
especially the balance between the

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,140
structure and flexibility is what makes

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:55,070
it so compelling you have this frame

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:58,040
wherein you can act as if you want and

00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:02,930
the group has the choice to meet the

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:05,390
group's need and this is what well yeah

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,420
makes it so easy to just jump into it

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,460
and use it for yourself and of course to

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:14,900
have a to have a space where you can

00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:17,870
experiment and when you can share what

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,630
you what you think what you heard what

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,060
you are up to and also of course your

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,270
failures where you where you get stuck

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:29,270
and you don't know any further this is

00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:33,530
very very valuable for all the others

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:38,690
and I can say it was very rewarding for

00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:42,100
me and the circles stick afterwards so

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:46,190
why should you go and try out the

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:48,800
working out loud you have three months

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:54,620
almost three months of support from

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:57,110
peers and it doesn't it's not only about

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,300
peers within your company it can also be

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:03,230
beyond of course within your community

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:07,100
or with another company who has

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:10,370
interested people and you can shape the

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,680
circle experience yourself you find the

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,570
fellows and of course it's free and open

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:19,640
source and you have a global community

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:21,740
you can draw from so now we had the

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,780
coffee and the tea and it both comes

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,580
with cookies of course you have the

00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,610
choice of the participants there is no

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,350
program that tells you this is your

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,630
mentor and this is your peer and you

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,540
need to be in there and there no you

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:38,770
pick the people that are interested in

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:41,840
doing this you just can start right away

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:44,870
you modify where it's necessary this is

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:48,590
up to you of course and you can benefit

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:51,820
from what's already there where should

00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:54,830
you start you should find the people

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,110
form a circle decide on the technique if

00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:00,050
the current problem is it something that

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,980
needs an ongoing support arrange for

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,590
time and space

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,960
this is crucial because this isn't

00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:09,200
something that will happen on the go you

00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,810
need to have some time blocked for this

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:16,430
because it's very essential that's it

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:19,010
that you commit yourselves to it so this

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,560
is my part thank you very much for

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:24,740
listening and well if there is a

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:28,510
question ask me now ask me later or

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,510
reach out thank you

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,890
[Music]

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:40,040
would there be any questions to

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:44,900
Christina well we have a couple of time

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:47,890
left so not so much comment but thank

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:50,720
you for this presentation there is a

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:53,090
another open source mentoring tool that

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,640
I've been watching that I think is

00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:58,610
tailored more towards if you have a

00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,420
specific path that you want your mentees

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,130
to go through

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:06,080
it's called Exorcism IO heard about but

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm not into it I have to admit yeah

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,350
yeah no it's just pretty interesting I

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,760
just thought I'd throw it out there yeah

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:18,940
this cool pair exe are not like the

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,940
religious act thank you

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:27,770
so oh yeah I don't know if that's like

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,660
really in scope but I was wondering if

00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,790
you could so all the techniques you

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,620
described are kind of like you know very

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,530
personal direct interaction and I was

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,820
wondering if you could tell me how to

00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,800
translate that to open source

00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,690
communities like I mean we try to like

00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,940
have open processes and have mailing

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,310
lists and Revie bots and that kind of

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,500
thing and it's it's a little it's less

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,700
personal and it's it's still the kind of

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,420
mentoring tool we use and it's not

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:56,960
really perfect sometimes you have any

00:15:52,420 --> 00:16:01,640
suggestions yeah well I think it always

00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:04,280
starts with yourself so where they start

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:08,240
not in the hole you start it yourself

00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:11,690
and your neighbors start at theirs and I

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:17,320
know that working out loud has become a

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:22,040
movement during the last two years and

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,380
they're they yeah kind of arranged for a

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,200
big conference meetings for working out

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:30,350
loud community for example at Porsche

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,589
and demons so big corporations hundred

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,780
thousands of people what I try to get

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:38,270
those into the network that really need

00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:42,020
to talk to each other and that really

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:44,790
need to want to proceed to advance and

00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:48,240
to get to know more and not only theirs

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:50,550
and I think in the communities it's it's

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:57,720
a bit the same you are so stuck in your

00:16:50,550 --> 00:17:00,260
aspect of the idea so that yeah this on

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,140
a higher level on a community level

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:07,110
should be arranged like in a conference

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,579
so this is the idea that I know about

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:14,089
and this works for those corporations

00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:17,280
the other thing is that those who has

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:20,400
who have already passed kind of passed

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,280
or done working out a lot circle go on

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,550
and do a second and a third one like me

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,850
so you get to know other people and you

00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:34,830
spread the word and making it a habit

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:38,250
was put there it changes you in a bit

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:41,280
so of course sharing is part of your

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,890
business but how you share and how you

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,880
network and how you reach out becomes a

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:50,850
bit different and thus it becomes more

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:57,390
open and maybe this helps the mindset

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:59,220
change thank you for the question as we

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,620
run out of time thank you very much

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,400
Kristina thanks for any for all the

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:07,500
comments and questions and I will I'm

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,240
sure you can get connected with

00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,880
Christina and the sponsors area at

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,710
lunchtime or some time else thank you

very much
