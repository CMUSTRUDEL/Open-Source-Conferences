Title: #FOSSBack 18: Tracy Evans & Jeffrey McGuire - Marketing your project to increase adoption
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Tracy Evans & Jeffrey McGuire talking about "Marketing Your Project to Increase Adoption and Grow Community".

Are you managing an open source project? How much does this matter to your reputation, business, or bottom line? This session will provide practical takeaways to help you reach the right audience and open up productive lines of communication with your project’s users and community members. This session is suitable for beginners to marketing.

From predictable release schedules and release notes; to the differences between tutorials, guides, and documentation; and yes, to your promotional schedule–marketing touches on all aspects of communication between your users and your product. This is Marketing through the lens of technical communication. We’ll look at marketing from an open source perspective and consider how you can apply well established techniques to help your project and community thrive.

Users don’t want to see their feature requests or bug reports sink into a black hole; they expect transparent communications; and they expect to be able to contribute improvements directly. What are popular open source projects doing right (and wrong) now and why? No matter the size, whether you have a new module, a theme, an integration, or a full distribution; you can probably find ways to improve your technical and marketing communications.

We often think of marketing as hyperbole or BS, but if you are authentic and accurate in your promotional communications, you can even market to developers :-) You’ll leave this session with a practical checklist of how you can improve the marketing and communication of your open source project to increase adoption and grow your user community.

	00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:09,260
that's alright that's fair when we

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:13,700
create marketing content which is a lot

00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,269
of what we do I am currently the hardest

00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,930
nails

00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:19,340
fine I have the final editorial say and

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:23,079
value judgments that we can't back up

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,189
right things that are hard to measure I

00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,660
get very nervous about those I try and

00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,599
cut them out as much as possible right

00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,099
because what you have then is a room or

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,370
an Internet full of geeks who are like

00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,469
oh yeah how do you prove to me that

00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:40,609
they're interesting cameramen wants me

00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:41,239
in the light ok - here - there there ok

00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:47,140
sorry

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:53,480
I'll do my best here so hey um yes so

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:56,359
marketing this is the stuff we love to

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,870
hate right

00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:04,699
and developers who live in a fact-based

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:09,590
reality right what do you think of you

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:12,049
know bingo so there is such a

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,549
thing as bad marketing and you know bad

00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,380
marketing will send the wrong message to

00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:17,270
the wrong audience and try to manipulate

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,180
you or try and sell you stuff that

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:24,290
doesn't exist yet or use words the wrong

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:27,860
way you know or not like develop a

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:30,680
relationship with you so so that is not

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:35,170
what we are about at open strategy

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,490
partners we we work with technology

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,899
organizations as their strategic parts

00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,750
and partner to help them communicate

00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,430
their value connect with the people who

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,500
need to hear their stories and grow

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,060
their communities so we do strategy

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,560
marketing communication for technology

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:53,920

few yes

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:35,970
represent um so we formed open strategy

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:39,390
partners most of a year ago and Tracy is

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,390
a serious business person with an actual

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,420
MBA and structure in a formal education

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:49,290
and experience in in real business stuff

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:52,290
so from enterprises right through to

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,850
startups and what have you I came out of

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,500
picking up a Drupal the open source CMS

00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,850
because I had a classical chamber music

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,580
group that needed a website that I

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,940
couldn't afford to pay for I was the

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,620
18th employee at Acquia and left when

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,959
Tucker is about 800 people nine years

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,860
later and I have fallen into a deep and

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,930
very well-appointed hole that is the

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,130
beautiful open source community so I

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,140
have a lot of strong ideas about

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,280
communications and how to connect people

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,650
and so on and we put those two things

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,870
together came up with this company needs

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,299
are incredibly it is our incredible

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,090
privilege to have Heather James Heather

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,940
McNamee now on board since January she's

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,370
a incredible pedagogue and trainer and

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,989
and technical communicators so that's us

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,400
that's open strategy partners we we

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,230
picked up somebody else two weeks ago

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,920
which is exciting so we're doing okay

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:47,130
it's it's fun so far this is the first

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,320
time we're giving this talk this is sort

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,049
of the current state as of literally

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,450
this morning about this topic and it

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,549
reflects a lot of our thinking and what

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,350
we're actually doing with some of our

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,360
real-life clients so we want to talk

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,299
about ourselves and what we call

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,680
authentic communication what what it is

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,049
and why we should care

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,150
basically present her contribution

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,940
marketing canvas that you can use to

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,910
build a marketing strategy communication

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,470
strategy to encourage growth to drive

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,150
contribution and so on in your open

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,970
source project and your technical

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,890
community what have you and then we'll

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,150
quickly go over the contribution flows

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,699
when all these things come together what

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,470
what can have

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,419
after having chatted with Lorna Jane

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,090
last night a couple of things that we

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:39,199
won't be talking about today so far are

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,840
things like talking about in a

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,669
sustainable engagement long term

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,069
contribution avoiding burnout and so on

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,539
we're focusing on the getting more

00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:49,370
people in and getting them started

00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:50,930
presenting with them with something that

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,629
makes it easier for them to be part of

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,169
it and contribute yes yes

00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:58,639
take it away Tracy Evans okay so Jam as

00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:00,440
you can see the practically lives on

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,419
stage me not so much I was having a

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,340
conversation earlier about this so I'm

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:06,949
far more nervous than he is so thank you

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,620
for your patience and understanding and

00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:11,539
so what I'd like to tell you a little

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,669
bit about is you know basically in

00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:16,520
developing any communication strategy

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:19,940
but especially one whose goals are

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,770
focused around contribution you'll want

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,449
to identify your audience define your

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:27,110
message and then communicate that

00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:30,229
message and what we see is a particular

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:34,069
pattern which is easily to to recognize

00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:36,229
in the open source that communication

00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:38,389
drives connection connection drives

00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:41,060
community and that community actually

00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:43,940
creates a lot of business value and this

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,949
is also a virtuous circle so it's

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,139
virtuous in that existing communities

00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:51,469
also create and strengthen connections

00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,650
as they grow and thereby generate more

00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:59,560
value and this is all underpinned by

00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:02,449
what we call authentic communication and

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,520
so basically you know if you want to

00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,819
break through the noise and connect with

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,949
open source contributors and developers

00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:11,840
whose BS radars are particularly high

00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:15,529
I've witnessed and I've seen some online

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,479
conversations that support this we need

00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:19,520
to swap out the buzzwords and the

00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:24,199
hyperbole for authentic communication

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:27,529
and what that looks like for us is doing

00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,240
this by starting from a place of empathy

00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:32,180
and it was super cool to talk watch the

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,250
talk earlier entirely about this topic

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,979
and it completely aligns with a lot of

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,050
what we were our views and what we were

00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:41,300
talking about related to empathy so that

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,539
was that was pretty super cool

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,819
um but it's basically just being able to

00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:49,250
put yourself in others shoes and to

00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:52,430
understand their needs be trying before

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,169
trying to solve their problem and we

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,970
want to be as clear as possible in the

00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:57,830
topics that we communicate using a

00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,990
common language and clear and relevant

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,509
signals and we want to build trust by

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,490
avoiding as much marketing BS as we can

00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:08,509
and also making sure that our arguments

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,580
make make logical sense and so authentic

00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:17,050
communication needs to be both

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:17,050
compelling and accurate is it me--don't

00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:22,729
one of the things that we're really

00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,430
looking into is is cultural aspects of

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,560
communication and internal communication

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,690
as we build our organizations it's

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,360
actually just as important as outwards

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,379
facing external communication and

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,930
contribution and and community building

00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:38,870
and so on is definitely important inside

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,550
of technology organizations and we've

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,199
been thinking a lot about DevOps and

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,840
breaking down silos and so on and

00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,880
there's this some there's this very

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,289
common scenario where you have developer

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,849
teams and business teams and they're

00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:52,130
just from different cultures they don't

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:53,300
understand each other they don't

00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,830
understand each other's needs they have

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,900
even thought of each other's needs they

00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,430
lack empathy potentially and that can

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,620
lead to poor communication which makes

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,800
it all worth so a culture right of

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,240
mistrust blame and lack of respect can

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,719
lead to slipped deadlines and shoddy

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:13,039
quality and demotivation and a lot of

00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:15,520
turnover and and so you know language is

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,219
it can be a problem here you know if if

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,270
developers using jargon all the time

00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:22,279
business person might not understand

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,430
that the business teams might be taking

00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,810
actions without talking to the technical

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,779
people first they might be selling stuff

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:33,800
that you definitely have not built yet

00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:35,300
right but it's you know the the the VC

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,490
right has put money in this and they

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,579
want to see that it matches a sorry but

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,680
it matches something it it's not a

00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:44,600
solution looking for a problem right and

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,120
then the exact she's under pressure like

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,240
so she just went out and aggressively

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,740
found some customers and to make the VC

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,720
happy and now she's putting a lot of

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,120
pressure on on on the developer Dan

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,040
right and run for dam feels hard to put

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,230
upon and might just get out her resume

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,930
and go somewhere else too right

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,630
and then the execs have sold what turns

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,490
out to be a crappy product so the client

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,810
that they got is not gonna be an

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,740
advocate later they're gonna leave

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,360
disappointing to the whole thing

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,970
eventually is just gonna fall apart

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,250
right so you need to be inclusive you

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,040
need to use your empathy you need to use

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,690
different language right so that if

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,070
you're transparent about building your

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,460
culture if you get the different

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,950
stakeholders on two teams to talk about

00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,410
what do you need where are we going how

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,790
can we do this you know for example you

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,340
might be able to come up with a solution

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,570
where you find an initial customer who

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,010
has the problem space that you're

00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,230
looking at who's willing to be a guinea

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,790
pig at a discount right and every time

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,740
you deliver something on top of the

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,320
Minimum Viable Product every time you

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,550
fix a bug they were thrilled right every

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,090
time you give them something better and

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,760
better and better

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,430
you're winning them as a champion for

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,990
life the the your your source of money

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,030
sees that there's a real problem being

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,420
solved by what you're doing right

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:03,720
the developers maybe are gonna deliver

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,770
something is this still oh yeah so the

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,470
other person's gonna deliver something

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,760
that you know meets the minimum need

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,830
that they've been part of discussing

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,950
right and then they're gonna be happy

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,320
because they're you know your technical

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,600
expertise has been respected right so it

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,630
can be a virtuous circle if you ask

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,370
questions if you you know include

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,020
everyone when you're planning things so

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,790
this is this is what one aspect of

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,450
communication that I've now talked about

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,660
far far too long but thank you is the

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:36,360
most important phrase they're by the way

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:39,210
so when we talk about common language

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,560
yes we need it the we need to empathy to

00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,830
build common goals for the organization

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,500
through inclusion and transparency and

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:49,230
we need clear communication with common

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,839
accurate language to connect rather than

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,190
divide and you know if you've started

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,260
from a place of empathy you'll

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,000
understand that the needs of your

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,630
business audience are not the same as

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,250
the needs of your technical audience and

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,860
your choice of language should reflect

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,480
that and I've I've experienced some of

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,460
these situations myself I was very

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,170
confused about what a function

00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,420
and then we just used you know found

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,600
different words that resonate to me as a

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,870
business person that I understood what

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,850
the value was for me and you know some

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,310
some great examples are something like

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,860
WYSIWYG is a great technical audience

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:29,220
word but business-friendly authoring is

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,560
a great business term or highly

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,780
available file systems plus auto-scaling

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,200
container orchestration for technical

00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,760
managers is a fabulous term but

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,350
consistently scaleable and highly

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,010
available is better for a business

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,960
audience and and sometimes a single

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,520
piece of content like a data sheet might

00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,080
actually combine both the technical

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,180
description and the business value that

00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,540
you get from that and can help clarify

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,360
for both sides I think you've got the

00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:00,270
next one - oh no no I put that one on

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,880
use what was gratifying to see Francis

00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,350
Frye recently do this TED talk it's it's

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,160
very very cool if you haven't seen it I

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,350
highly recommend it

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,780
we at open strategy partners have

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,410
developed this model of empathy clarity

00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,780
and Trust in building our communications

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:18,540
it's really interesting that Francis

00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,880
Frye then defines trust in her talk

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,460
about about rebuilding building and

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,130
rebuilding trust she defines trust as

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,710
logical rigor okay so you can't talk

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,530
nonsense to me you have to make sense or

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,390
I can't trust you authenticity if you're

00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,890
not being yourself right if you're

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:38,060
selling something that you don't believe

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:40,560
in we're gonna see through you and then

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,530
the third pillar in her definition of

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,180
trust is that I have empathy to you so

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,380
which I feel ties nicely because that

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,570
circles right back to where we start

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,370
with empathy try and understand your

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,980
needs what you want to what you want to

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,680
learn how what we do can help so empathy

00:12:52,980 --> 00:13:01,320
clarity trust backed up by logical rigor

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:03,930
authenticity back to empathy so so this

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,750
is so in our communication we're trying

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:09,210
to send out trust signals and you know

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,730
not sell vaporware try to be technically

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:14,070
accurate and especially in open source

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,080
land it's really really really important

00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,750
to celebrate the communities that were

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,670
part of to highlight people's efforts

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,960
who've who've gone into building the

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,480
tools that that the

00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,130
that we in business are selling we and

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,560
marketing or promoting than in that you

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,600
are using and also then improving as

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,240
contributors and so on right so trust

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,400
signals two examples of you know that

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,560
was some nice theory two quick examples

00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,900
of how we at open strategy partners put

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,780
this into practice we use everything I

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:45,120
just said - for example define a

00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,980
community and stakeholders who need to

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,960
know about your local development

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:54,510
environment product and go and conduct

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,680
stories find out you know who built it

00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,390
and why they built it and what they were

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,040
doing and what the users are getting out

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,740
of it but like actually really talking

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,310
to these people and I can create expert

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,990
level content not being an expert if I

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,760
talk with you as an expert and I quote

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,920
you accurately right it's very very

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,080
powerful to actually ask questions right

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,510
then we create content we publish it we

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,280
promote it you know attract more people

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,890
to your thing and and so on so that's

00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,590
sort of a workflow that we use and one

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:25,320
of one of our favorite examples of this

00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:27,930
Heather put in an awful lot of work into

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,510
this we all contributed it one of our

00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,280
clients is drug tech they make a really

00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:36,600
neat tool if you work in PHP check it

00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:39,060
out we created the brilliant sprint

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,770
guide so we are talking about

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,800
contribution at a meta level and their

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,810
tool enables contributions so we have an

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,970
open source how to run a great

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:51,990
contribution sprint guide that we

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:54,060
created in the name of our client and it

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,710
is also you know ready for pull requests

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,320
ready for you to use ready to go and

00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:01,440
help you have better Sprint's and this

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,690
is marketing materials right so now this

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,720
is us doing marketing in the open source

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,640
space and hopefully well I can tell you

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,470
for sure that it's not right

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,780
it's incredibly practical and helpful if

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,030
you want to go and like then multiply

00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,290
your own open source stuff that's what

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:21,150
we're about so yeah so so now we'll look

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,550
at ways that you can build a marketing

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:26,040
strategy to increase contribution which

00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:29,070
is kind of what we promised in attending

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,870
here and so basically these are going to

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,940
be structures that should help you to

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,360
define your audience clarify your

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,040
message and

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:41,529
people come and contribute to your

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:44,680
project and so this is the model this is

00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:46,120
contribution marketing canvas and I'm

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,430
sure you're all familiar with the

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,800
business model canvas buy strategize err

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:54,220
yes they do know business model canvas

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,350
okay well okay the for review well done

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,450
the rest of you it's it's pretty neat

00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,000
it's pretty neat but we took our

00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:04,500
inspiration for from the business model

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,510
canvas and reconstruct reconstructed it

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,070
for contribution marketing but we wanted

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:12,040
to think about the components obviously

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:14,290
very differently for this and so we

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,480
wanted to address you know what are your

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:20,410
contribution goals who's your target

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,769
audience what kind of signals put out a

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,750
sign of vibrancy and quality why should

00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:27,700
they choose your project a project so

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,100
why what problem is it solving for them

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,990
and why they should particularly

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,000
contribute to your project when they

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,670
could be contributing to a thousands of

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,949
others and how they should contribute

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:43,329
contribute where to connect and what

00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:45,490
stories to tell about it so the first

00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:47,320
aspect of this is you need to figure out

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,680
what is it you actually need what what

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,810
what is it in attracting community and

00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,130
users and contributors like what is the

00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,829
thing that you actually need right

00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:00,850
because everybody knows that this is

00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:03,310
what maintaining an open-source app a

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,350
you know extension plugin like it's like

00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,299
this every night of the week right

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,780
except Thursdays when it's movie night

00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:12,490
no yes that does this reflect your

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,370
experience of maintaining open source

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:22,089
projects Lorna Jane no is it more like

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:23,949
that yes she said yes so right we need

00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:28,780
some help here

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:30,669
right why do I want contributors anybody

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,290
got any why why would you want a

00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:35,590
contributor to your project here's some

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,000
ideas anyone else something else why

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:43,840
would I want contributors community

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,910
members yes to drive business because

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,169
maybe you sell support contracts to your

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,160
project or maybe they'll be your

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:50,160
advocates or maybe

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,670
business means relevance relevance means

00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:08,370
more contribution that sounds awesome

00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:10,410
I hope we wrote that down Shane okay

00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,610
great can then that opens the doors to

00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,130
more people using it faster write

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,950
rewrite the how-to guide for real humans

00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,500
not Shane yeah awesome okay and here's

00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:25,350
some so here's some some some reasons

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:26,960
why we might want contributors and so we

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,950
need to come up with some project

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,510
objectives where are we where are we

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,800
going what is it that are where are we

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,720
today and where does our project need to

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,070
be and what's missing to get there so we

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,200
might say oh well we want to deliver

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,240
tech and we want to grow adoption and

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,100
grow community and contribution okay so

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,500
those are our objectives here in this

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,930
fictitious use case retelling and we're

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,240
gonna dive into number three right and

00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,700
we're gonna say okay growing community

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,970
and contribution concrete measurable

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,890
goals right I want 20 more people at my

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,650
next contribution sprint and the last

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:01,050
one and I want a new sponsor and I want

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,660
people to talk about what I'm doing in

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:07,230
public so those are the goals I want to

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,820
fulfill these of course will vary wildly

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:13,080
depending on what your project in your

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:15,120
situation are so now we've gotten to a

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,010
set of goals that were that we're

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,250
painting on to this to this market in

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:23,430
canvas and so in thinking about who

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,080
should contribute to your project you

00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,670
know think about based on your goals and

00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,890
the types of contribution that you need

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,740
who do you really want to attract to

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:34,530
contribute to your project is it des is

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,910
it only devs what about the writers what

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,960
about marketers what about social

00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:43,380
scientists what about philosophy majors

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,140
and it just it's really helpful to just

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,280
take a step back and really think

00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,980
intentionally about who would actually

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,240
provide a ton of value to contribute to

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,090
the activities that you want to have

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,860
done and it's also important to be clear

00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,910
about who is meant to be part of your

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,230
community or event or initiative and

00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,190
that doesn't need to be everybody it's

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,750
not if you

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,840
if you're targeted to everybody you're

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:10,860
not targeted to really anybody at all

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,049
but it should be clear that here you as

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,519
a business person you belong here you

00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:17,820
belong in this room you belong at this

00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:23,399
table or developer or marketer or or

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:25,230
whatnot also whatnots welcome so the

00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:28,649
next thing is the term Heather actually

00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:30,240
came up with one day in what we were

00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:34,919
talking of I brron see signals you know

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,019
so so yeah if you go on github and you

00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,690
see a project where the last commit was

00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,850
in 2017 or if you're on somebody slack

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,649
channel they don't answer for some

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,200
number of hours or what-have-you right

00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:48,990
we're also really really sensitive to if

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,029
we if this thing is if this thing is

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,360
still a thing right is it still alive is

00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:56,100
it vibrant and there's a ton of ways

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,960
that we have a ton of signals depending

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,629
on the project to decide is this thing

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,950
really alive and are they doing a good

00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:06,240
job of taking care of it and of their

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,740
can I just point out that I was so

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,149
excited and this was a completely

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,450
different perspective for me as a

00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:13,980
marketer to look at that as important

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,600
signals to communicate and that was

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,159
something that was really cool that

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,679
Heather brought onboard when she started

00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,899
with us to point out that that is very

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,730
much a part of the message that you're

00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:24,929
communicating about your project yeah

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,190
it's great to it's great to be able to

00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:30,360
put a name to this for us right and then

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:33,990
documentation and clear documentation is

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,820
is is certainly a part of this right you

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,399
want to tell people as clearly as

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,440
possible you know this is how we work

00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:42,960
this is how we develop these are our

00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,450
expectations so and github provides you

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,659
a great opportunity to make a brand

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,340
landing page in your readme show what

00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,960
your value proposition declare your

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,950
license make everything as clear as

00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,330
possible Community Guidelines this is

00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,789
how we do requests this is how we

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:03,000
develop this is you know example code

00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:05,899
the the more of this you offer right

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,500
that the cleaner and tighter your github

00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:13,440
bitbucket wherever you are pages are you

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,059
know the better off potential new

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,990
community members and contributors are

00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,330
going to be

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,789
and then fantastic vitality signal of

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,409
course is testimonials right so our

00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:25,470
friend Alex burrows in London is

00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:28,799
incredibly excited about the d-day of

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,389
local development tool and he really

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,190
actually he really he's a real champion

00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:35,789
he really makes sure people know how

00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:38,519
much he likes it and the next question

00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:42,450
we want to tackle is why specifically

00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:44,820
your project so is this useful and

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:48,659
important to me they need to become not

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,639
just a user but a high-level super in

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:54,509
love with your technology and your

00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:56,070
project kind of user and you know we

00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:57,629
need to have laser sharp messaging that

00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,509
articulates what problem you're solving

00:22:57,629 --> 00:23:02,399
for me how you're solving it and why

00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:05,480
it's helping my problem more effective

00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:08,460
than any other alternative out there

00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,049
this is actually the strategies or

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,730
guides and this is kind of a sub

00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:14,100
component of their business model just

00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,559
in case you're curious so this is in in

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,730
marketing land that is a determining

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,559
product market fit right which is which

00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,269
is not developer friendly language it's

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,679
not the way that we would talk to with

00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:28,200
you about its are you making something

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,389
cool and useful that will make another

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,610
developers day better right that's the

00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:38,429
that's a that's what this can help you

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:40,710
it's a it's a neat tool so if you find

00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:42,149
something out there that you think you

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,190
might want to use or that you have used

00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:47,519
a little bit there's there could be you

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,869
know you have to decide if you're going

00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,629
to contribute and there are there are

00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:54,419
good reasons to contribute to projects a

00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:55,679
lot of these for this particular list is

00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:58,649
I want to contribute because I want to

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,809
make myself a better developer or I want

00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:03,149
to help others be better developers

00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,220
scratch my own itch of course is you

00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:06,480
know hoof there's a bug here and

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,710
actually I know that I could write the

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,419
patch to you know to do that but do I

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,419
want to am i motivated enough to is it

00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:17,730
worth it right is the project vibrant

00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:19,919
enough are they paying attention enough

00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,830
that's going to be worth my time right

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,659
to help them out so some of the things

00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:28,289
that can get in the way even if you have

00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,730
like very good reasons to want to do

00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,260
this you know

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,690
it just could be really really hard to

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,960
set up whatever stack that thing runs on

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,670
it could be that you're actually new to

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,140
contribution you're really unfamiliar

00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:44,880
with how pole requests work it might be

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,790
that if you're doing this in a context

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,140
at work it might be that you're using

00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,920
open source stuff and this is an

00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:55,560
entirely other talk that I give between

00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:59,010
the the bosses in the and the bosses and

00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,130
the developers like am I allowed to

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:03,390
contribute back upstream because you

00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,490
know we're using all this stuff so

00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,810
there's a companies who use open source

00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:10,170
technology all over the place but have

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:11,910
no defined policies about contribution

00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,410
and because I contend they don't

00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:17,730
understand the value that they derive

00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:20,520
from it ask me afterwards but so my

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,990
friend Christensen did an academic

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,430
research paper on open source

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,350
contribution and we've turned this into

00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,030
a body of work together about the

00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:32,820
business value of contribution so it's

00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:35,430
really really typical to not know how to

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,160
contribute or just not have the time to

00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:40,080
contribute or have doubts about yourself

00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,490
or maybe you just don't know if you're

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,070
really really allowed to and those

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,020
things can all be made worse by the

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,910
embarrassment of a state having to ask a

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,770
colleague how to do something right or

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,450
the fact that it does take more of your

00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:53,490
time or that you don't know what your

00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,040
priorities are at work or that the scope

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,330
of your your activity at work is wrong

00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,010
and just doesn't allow you to actually

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,830
go and fix the thing that's holding all

00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:06,360
the team back right so these are real

00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:09,440
blockers in in real organizations and

00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:13,680
there are actions that you can take to

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,680
unblock them so we felt talking with our

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,120
client it dried that in general

00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,570
contribution Sprint's are a great thing

00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,390
and there was a gap to produce a great

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:26,100
guide on how to do them so in that

00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,080
training and guidance enabler the green

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,170
things are enabler rights training and

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,350
guidance proficiency skill level you

00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,480
know we contributed to making those

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,710
things better by showing how to do you

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,320
know how to set up a good sprint so

00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,759
better communication teaching people how

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,039
to do it making time

00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:47,579
contributing fixes to your definition of

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,379
done these are all great ways to enable

00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:51,940
contribution and one more analogy from

00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:54,429
Heather she says when you're trying to

00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:57,190
explain your project documentation is a

00:26:54,429 --> 00:27:00,969
map and tutorials are a travel book but

00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,109
training is a guided tour so we have ten

00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:05,909
minutes all right

00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:09,459
okay so let's get into how to contribute

00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:15,009
basically there's there are hundreds of

00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:16,989
ways to contribute and but if you target

00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,389
every type of contribution you'll again

00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:21,039
be targeting nothing effectively so

00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:22,809
looking at the project goals you need to

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,119
ask yourself in your team what are the

00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,389
key areas and activities of contribution

00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,889
that will help build the project

00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:32,349
momentum towards its goals that it's

00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:35,109
seeking and note here that contribution

00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:38,649
is by is by no means limited to coding

00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:40,179
activities right somehow we feel it's

00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:41,769
important to set Lorna Jane is nodding

00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:46,149
it's important to say this over and over

00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:48,099
and over again Chris and I in our work

00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:49,690
between the research and the interviews

00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,209
that we did in our own experience we

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,809
determines what we thought were the

00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:58,659
7-ish most most effective ways of

00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:01,029
contribution code reviews are really

00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:02,649
often overlooked and more people need

00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:04,479
more code reviews because that blocks

00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:06,969
that really blocks coding contribution

00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:09,519
in general sponsorship always helps it

00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:11,499
would be super cool if more people could

00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,639
make more open source stuff pretty right

00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:17,649
there's a hi nurse please help us um and

00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:20,379
another thing you know evangelism is is

00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:23,709
is quite well understood in some

00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:26,279
contexts in software in certain ways but

00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:28,599
marketing and marketing contributions

00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,069
seem to have been overlooked in many

00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,190
many cases and that's one of the things

00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:36,459
that we're doing with our clients yeah

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:38,049
so yeah we we've noticed that marketing

00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:40,209
seems to be an area that's often

00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,699
overlooked when when they're thinking

00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:45,639
about how to increase contribution and

00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:49,209
we've been working with our clients to

00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:52,059
help them help them increase things like

00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:54,239
telling their story getting enabling the

00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:56,570
community to write blog articles or

00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:59,050
posting things on social media

00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:03,830
or helping with the branding and the CI

00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:09,340
and there's a lot more that we can do to

00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:13,370
better enable these activities yeah and

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:15,380
write this so and there's one more

00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:17,120
concept that kind of in how to

00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:21,920
contribute and how to enable

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,930
contribution there's these it is it Dan

00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,850
pink who talks about intrinsic

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:29,600
motivation yes master you're trying to

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:32,870
be purpose right so you can the better

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:38,090
your documentation is right the more you

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:40,400
enable people to be autonomous and the

00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:42,470
more you automate quality control like

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,190
having a test suite in place and so on

00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:48,230
the more you ought you can automate

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,850
mastery right all the bad code that

00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,130
you've written you can regex for bad

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:54,020
patterns all the things that don't ever

00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,300
pass your test suite if I put them in

00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,170
because my coding I swear you don't want

00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,330
it right

00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,310
it helps me if I a new team member a new

00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,870
community member whatever the more

00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,910
automation the more quality controls

00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,410
here the more mastery you're actually

00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:08,660
transferring to the people who want to

00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:11,990
help you out which in turn helps them

00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:14,870
learn be more autonomous and so on and

00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:17,630
if we've got a vibrant project that is

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:19,520
helping that person you know have a

00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,020
better day at work and they're able to

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,180
give back of course this this this

00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,630
generates community right and a sense of

00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,530
purpose between us also so actually

00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:30,200
documentation and automation are

00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:33,440
incredible incredibly strong tools for

00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,420
generating intrinsic motivation second

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,090
to last point here we're doing ok on

00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:43,250
time oh yeah where to find people well

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:46,310
let's have a website right github and or

00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:50,290
gitlab and whatever happens now social

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:56,090
coding and so on event participation

00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:57,500
some of these things here typo3 case

00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,270
studies are really interesting case if

00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,460
you can get people to talk in person

00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,070
about the benefits that they're getting

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,330
from you it can create some real

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,820
connection and some real value and

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,140
sometimes a businessperson really really

00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,370
needs to hear from another business

00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,870
person

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,030
that this thing helped them right and

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,920
and if it's them talking they're the

00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:18,680
people who have the money to pay us to

00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,390
do our thing right so if we can get them

00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:25,790
involved it can be it can be a really

00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:27,170
really huge help so we define what our

00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,390
project needs and what our specific

00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:30,800
goals right now are in terms in today

00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,690
and contribution and community growth

00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,340
and we collect all these information

00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,559
these bits of information through here

00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:40,160
then we as content marketers when we're

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,720
thinking about content and our kind of

00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,280
marketing activities we put them

00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:48,440
together into narratives and stories and

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,420
yeah exactly so you know considering

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,980
what your goals are who you want to

00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,200
attract why and how they should

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,450
contribute then you need to take that

00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,309
information and ask yourself what

00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,240
stories are important to tell what are

00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:01,160
the narratives that are going to

00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,210
illustrate your great technology what

00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,390
are the narratives that will illustrate

00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,760
a vibrant community and here's just a

00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:10,700
couple of examples that we helped drug

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,960
build and this is this is actually

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,900
really really from our work and these

00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,610
things flow into editorial plans

00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,500
publishing activities making videos

00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,520
conference sessions you know these are

00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,650
themes that are actually important

00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,540
exactly and then here's a few more that

00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:26,090
we've been working on with with typo3 to

00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:30,470
tell their story and it's got a nice mix

00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:32,540
of the technical value and oh yeah I

00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:35,660
didn't mean to interrupt you okay I

00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:37,340
apologize that's okay the type of three

00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,140
story for us is really interesting we

00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,670
have the commercial arm of the open

00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,710
source CMS as a client the type of

00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,570
3-game aha and we have the type of three

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,700
Association which has allowed us to have

00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,400
a really interesting expanded mandate so

00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,870
we're thinking about their technology as

00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,340
a whole and trying to grow adoption and

00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:54,920
and and all of that stuff around the

00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:57,350
tech but also how we can sell help sell

00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,970
their products that help help your

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,610
agencies your job and so on like

00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:05,000
extended support training junior

00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:07,610
engineers selling SaaS working on the

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,920
you know the GDP our solutions for this

00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,510
so there's a this product side of things

00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,840
for us open-source products are really

00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:17,270
fascinating to me um but at the same

00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,280
time we're doing community marketing and

00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:22,850
we're working we're helping with do PR

00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,630
and an open-source contribution and then

00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,669
we

00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:29,539
we get into this I'm gonna cut slightly

00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:30,620
ahead I think yeah well there's a

00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:31,970
there's a really interesting point that

00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,570
I wanted to get to where's there right

00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:37,070
it was workshop slide no well it fits in

00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,280
with the other oh it fits in there okay

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,660
too

00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,860
so if you've put all this stuff together

00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:45,110
we get to this thing that we're calling

00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:50,720
the contribution flow state right now

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:52,160
you find if you if I if I get your

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,299
attention you see a tweet or something

00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:57,289
right

00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:58,880
Oh hmm other interesting client you

00:33:57,289 --> 00:34:01,820
could be our clients talk to me

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,200
afterwards you know and you read a blog

00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,030
post or you go to the website and you

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,559
it's like okay that's cool and right and

00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,540
then you download it it's open source so

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,800
you can see the thing and you install it

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,679
and it helps you a little bit and that's

00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,480
cool and then you know you have a

00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,460
question and you go in the slack channel

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,710
and they answer it quickly it's like hey

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,480
this is alright and you look and then

00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:22,010
people are contributing back to it and

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,960
there's been regular releases and it's

00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,550
like now it supports all different

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,679
versions of Windows and it does you know

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,869
other things like wow that's a community

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,129
it's a life like actually this thing

00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:34,369
that I need I'm gonna contribute that

00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:35,750
too right so this is this map of we've

00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:37,850
set up everything that we were just

00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,290
talking about before so that it's ready

00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,570
for that to happen everyone can find

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:43,429
their way in in you know in there really

00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:46,100
naturally oh I see what you did there

00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:50,210
sorry so and here's another concrete

00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:52,190
example of this and so actually we do

00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,770
get into a little bit of engagement that

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,050
Laura Jane was talking to you about

00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:59,390
yesterday so basically after you know

00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,630
once you have contribution you need to

00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:04,130
support continuous involvement and

00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:06,650
incrementally higher value involvement

00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:08,869
and you know asking people to begin with

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:11,480
something small although not unimportant

00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:13,250
like sharing other people's stories or

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,609
being interviewed for another person's

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:19,940
story it makes it easier to say yes when

00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:23,240
it's a small ask and the incremental

00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:26,060
asks then build trust along the way and

00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,250
it also makes it easier to say yes to

00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,530
higher levels of engagement because we

00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:32,690
already feel invested and committed to

00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,119
the cause so by the time I ask you to

00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:36,920
write and publish a story you'll have

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,430
already you know been doing some of

00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,630
those things like

00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,040
sharing other people's stories are

00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,630
contributing other people's stories and

00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,040
you'll feel invested in the project and

00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,410
want to see it succeed so you'll be that

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,680
much more motivated to spend the time in

00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:50,780
writing a story yourself or yeah so a

00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,390
concrete example of this is actually the

00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:57,079
type of community writers program that

00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:59,150
that Heather and I have designed and the

00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,430
community needs more content and more

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,930
relevant content and they need to be

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,530
tighter in their communication so we're

00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:08,540
going in and we're doing reasonably

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,040
regular online workshops here's how you

00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,540
run an interview with someone's use as a

00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,480
source for more material here's how you

00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,710
write a case study here's how you so on

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,059
and so on and they're kind of they build

00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,130
on each other and they're cyclical and

00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:20,900
we can have regular contact with our

00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,030
marketing team that way in this it's a

00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,190
it's a pretty cool way of cat herding

00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,200
right and it's totally acceptable if

00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,030
it's six people or if it's you know 18

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,069
people the online format is low

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:33,500
investment for everyone low cost low

00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:36,010
travel cost and so on so we're running

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,670
these regular community writers program

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:42,440
events now we've done one live community

00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,329
marketing sprint but the marketing

00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,530
Sprint's now the in-person sprints will

00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:50,119
just be inflection points for a team

00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,309
that works together regularly and

00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,400
communicates regularly working up that

00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:58,730
ladder from like retweeting the project

00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:02,450
lead to publishing an interview and so

00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:05,059
on and these skills right are also all

00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,829
valuable for your agency the pre your

00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:09,470
project the place you work like whatever

00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:13,309
it is that you do besides typo3 or

00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:15,319
whatever it is all of these skills just

00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:17,030
make us better contributors for

00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:19,299
everything we're doing so this is

00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:22,880
another excellent you know concrete

00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:25,180
expression of the theories that we have

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,770
putting into practice to actually help

00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,290
clients yeah and how we enable the rest

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,030
of the community to contribute in a

00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,369
field that they may not have felt like

00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,809
they were experts to begin with and part

00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:38,540
of that workshop what at least the bits

00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:40,760
that I've overheard is encouraging

00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,530
people that they actually they do and

00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,030
can have the skillset to contribute in

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,609
that way they don't need to have been a

00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,390
marketer or a professional writer

00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:51,620
everybody's got a story to tell

00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:53,270
right and incredibly radically on time

00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,480
we told you a little bit about ourselves

00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:58,400
and what we call authentic communication

00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:02,120
we talked about building up a structure

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,460
to to create communication artifacts to

00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,890
prepare to be prepared to grow your

00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,360
community and and and contributors and

00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:12,860
some of the things that can result from

00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:14,660
being that prepared we're not dealing

00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,850
with the sustainability in the long term

00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,710
engagement part so much or like the

00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:22,760
specific tools of the trade or you know

00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:26,300
choosing this you know tool over that

00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,760
tool but some models to start with yes

00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:34,370
so we got a lot of stuff from the

00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:37,660
internet Thank You internet and thank

00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,660
you for coming listening to us

00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:54,180
I think we have four minutes for

00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:55,560
questions yes any questions I'll repeat

00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,790
the question for them for the mic you

00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:19,920
give it to him and you good so you start

00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:26,190
Shane oh oh so adding marketing cues to

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:29,220
your oh okay but but what you're saying

00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:31,670
is adding marketing enablement into your

00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,450
into your read means into your

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,000
contributing and you like and all that

00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:40,320
stuff yeah no I think that's write it

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:46,260
down I mean I'd be foolish not to agree

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:47,580
with you you had a I was just wanted to

00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,860
ask if you have your slides available

00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,780
somewhere not for the cute animals but

00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,630
all those lists and graphs they're

00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:57,390
