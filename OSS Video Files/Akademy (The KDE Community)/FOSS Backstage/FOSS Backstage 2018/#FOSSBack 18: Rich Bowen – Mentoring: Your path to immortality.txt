Title: #FOSSBack 18: Rich Bowen â€“ Mentoring: Your path to immortality
Publication date: 2018-06-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Open source needs people to write the code today, but, even more important, is those that will write the code tomorrow. Investing in the people who will replace you is the only way to ensure immortality, both for yourself, and for the project you care so much about. In this session, you'll learn you practical ways to invest in people, and about why, sometimes, *not* fixing a bug is a better choice than fixing it.

	00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,500
thank you so much for coming I know

00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,360
there's a lot of great content of this

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,530
event you could be listening to so I

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,520
appreciate you coming to listen to me

00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:23,539
I've been doing open source for several

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,339
years and I'm here because people took

00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,500
the opportunity to mentor me and teach

00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:30,320
me how to do things and I'm hoping to to

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,430
share some of these practical tips with

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,500
you there's been some content already in

00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,050
the event about various tools you can

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,090
use and you know people that have done

00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,820
research on this these are my

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,500
observations over the last 20 years I've

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,690
been largely making it up as I go along

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,790
but I have been doing it for a while so

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,250
hopefully some of this is not far off

00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,200
the mark something that I've observed

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,270
over the years is that people have many

00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,380
different reasons for getting involved

00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:02,930
in open source software and often the

00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,879
first one of these is to solve problems

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,770
to solve your own problems to work on

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,220
something that's not working quite the

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:12,590
way you anticipated another reason is

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,290
that it's a lot of fun people do it

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,730
because it's a hobby people do it

00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,380
because they want to make the world a

00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,750
better place

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,680
one of the reasons that people stay in

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,680
open-source is often the the possibility

00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:33,340
of leaving a legacy leaving something

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:36,530
that people will remember and so my my

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,380
premise here is that your way to achieve

00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:44,390
immortality and open-source is to mentor

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:46,909
people to come behind you and this is a

00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,370
this is something that has that has

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:50,990
proven out in my own experience so I

00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,729
want to start with this photograph here

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,400
well it's not a photograph obviously

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,610
this painting here does anyone know who

00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,610
this is

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:05,330
alright this is a famous painting by

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:08,049
Titian of Socrates and in this painting

00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,789
Socrates is sitting on his bed

00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:12,620
expounding great truths and in fact in

00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:16,489
the picture he's about to drink some

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,450
poison and commit suicide Socrates is

00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:20,989
fascinating to

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,940
me because he was the the original you

00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:25,489
know that the programmer who thinks that

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,870
his code should speak for himself he he

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:29,390
never wrote anything down he never

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,379
documented in fact he believed that

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:36,560
writing stuff down was antithetical to

00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:44,120
teaching philosophy and so he never

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:48,200
wrote anything down we we know what he

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,640
said because his his disciples wrote it

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,910
down

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,349
so in particular Aristotle wrote down

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,900
most of what he said and that's that's

00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:00,650
how we even know that this guy existed

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,780
and so the lesson here is that if you

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,280
want to be immortal have disciples that

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,530
write down everything you say and hang

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,510
on your every word right and that's

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:13,069
that's a great dream how about this guy

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:14,870
anybody know who this guy is I see that

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:20,390
most of you know that this is Vincent

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:23,150
van Gogh and he achieved immortality not

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,980
by having disciples or even by being a

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,650
nice person I've been reading a book

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:30,410
called dear Theo which is a collection

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,049
of his letters to his brother Theo and

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,329
every single letter sounds like I'm a

00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,019
genius nobody understands that I'm a

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:38,630
genius

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:40,220
please send me more money and every

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:43,100
letter is like that he's apparently a

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,260
very unpleasant man and also throughout

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,180
his life he felt that he wasn't terribly

00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,560
successful because he didn't get the

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,480
recognition he deserved but this this

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,290
feeling of not being successful he

00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:02,810
channeled into hard work and he created

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:05,930
an enormous body of of work and so now

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,910
you can go into most major museums in

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,099
the world and you'll find at least one

00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:13,849
picture that he painted because he was

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:15,889
so prolific he did in fact have one

00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,320
friend that he kind of mentored and that

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:21,349
was Paul Gauguin who's my favorite

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,610
painter but primarily we remember him

00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:27,050
because he painted so much so that's

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,520
lesson two if you want to be remembered

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,520
do a lot of work and

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,330
come back to that in a minute how about

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:39,040
this guy anybody know who aqaq or T's is

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,510
unless you are a PhD student in

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,250
philosophy you've probably never heard

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:48,340
of this guy he was one of Aristotle's

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,620
friends possibly maybe maybe he was a

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,140
just a co student it's it's really

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,200
unclear who he was he's mentioned once

00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,210
in the writings of Aristotle and he's

00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,200
mentioned as though he was an important

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,760
character but we don't know anything

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,200
about him because he didn't write

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,820
anything down and didn't have any

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,000
disciples to write anything down

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,190
so now you've heard his name which puts

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,070
you above you know most of the rest of

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,830
the world so here's what we learned if

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:18,490
you want to be immortal you can either

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,110
leave an extensive body of work or you

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,540
can leave students who are even more

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,190
intelligent than yourself and both of

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,420
these are are challenging things to do

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,580
let's start with option number one leave

00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,920
an extensive body of work one thing that

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:38,110
you find ok so this is another painting

00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:42,490
by Titian and it it is a picture of a

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:47,020
guy by the name of Sisyphus and Sisyphus

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:50,460
was punished by the gods his punishment

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:53,230
was to carry a rock up to up a hill and

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,870
every single time he got to the top of

00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,370
the hill he would accidentally drop the

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,910
rock and would roll to the bottom of the

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:04,270
hill now if you read a lot of Greek

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,520
mythology you'll notice that the

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,710
punishment always fits the crime always

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:16,020
in kind of an ironic cruel way

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:18,640
Sisyphus his crime was being extremely

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,560
self-important he was very fond of

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,150
himself he he did all of this

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,160
magnificent stuff and was always telling

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,040
somebody about it but the funny thing

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,850
about doing hard work is that as soon as

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,820
you stop people start to forget you you

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,920
know you can you can contribute to a to

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,540
an open-source project for years and

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,340
years but as soon as you stop eventually

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,340
your patches are overwritten by other

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,830
patches and your effect goes away and so

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,920
hard work is just

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,810
it's just too much hard work so I

00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,400
recommend option number two which is to

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,920
leave impressive students to mentor

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,170
people to come behind you

00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:02,590
doing hard work means you actually have

00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:08,140
to do that hard work so Plato Aristotle

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:10,240
Socrates I see we don't have any

00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:14,530
Princess Bride fans here all right

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,810
Plato Aristotle Socrates because

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:22,710
Socrates invested his life in his

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:25,690
disciples his student his student Plato

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,730
wrote down a lot of this I got the names

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,230
wrong a little while back and none of

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,810
the philosophy students in the audience

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:35,560
called me out on it Plato was was

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,540
Socrates his disciple and one of Plato's

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,180
disciples was Aristotle in between the

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:43,260
three of these people they form the

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:48,310
basis for what we consider modern

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:53,320
philosophy and each one down the line

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:57,480
learned from from their their instructor

00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:00,130
and we see the chain of mentoring now

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,170
I'll give you one word of caution and

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,760
that is be careful who you mentor

00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:10,090
because one of Aristotle's mentors was

00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:12,160
Alexander the Great who killed much of

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,050
the world at the time you know he swept

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,880
across the world and destroyed nations

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:21,960
and so you know be careful who you

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,700
mentor they might destroy the world but

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:30,430
here's some some practical tips about

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:32,770
mentoring that that that I think that

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,450
you can apply immediately these don't

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,320
these don't take years of practice these

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,300
are things that you can apply

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:42,100
immediately the first and I think the

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,690
most important thing that you can do as

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:49,960
a mentor is to give permission now we

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,670
have this notion that because it's open

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,340
source everybody has permission and they

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:57,270
know it and that is not the case you

00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,810
need to explicitly give permission for

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,140
people to

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:04,240
feel that they have permission and this

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,230
this may seem unintuitive if you've just

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,820
been doing this for years but it is a

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,370
common theme among beginners that they

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,260
don't feel like they're it's not I'm not

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,790
one of the core developers I can't do

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,470
that I don't really feel like I have the

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,670
rights to do that now there's two

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,310
different ways that you can give

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,990
permission the first one is simply

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,870
giving technical permission giving

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:29,260
people right access to the repository

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:32,320
giving people right access to the wiki

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,670
to the documentation to the the Google

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,740
Doc where you're developing your

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,250
marketing presentation giving people the

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,950
technical permission to do the work is

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:46,060
the first step here and you need to make

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,710
that as easy as possible if people have

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,680
to jump through a lot of Hoops in order

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:53,170
to contribute a change they're gonna go

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,700
away now I'm I'm one of the

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,910
administrators on the Apache Software

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:02,290
Foundation Facebook page and we got a

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:04,960
message from some user some Cassandra

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,400
user a couple days ago that said hey you

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,760
have a typo on the front page of your

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:14,200
website and one of the other

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:17,890
administrators responded with well in

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,270
order to fix a problem on the front page

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,460
of the cassandra site you need to

00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:24,490
subscribe to this mailing list and then

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,170
you need to send them a patch and and

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,670
they'll apply to that patch so here's

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,020
how you subscribe to the mailing list

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,120
and here's how you post to it and the

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,130
guy was like that's way too much trouble

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,450
just just fix your typo can you do that

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,180
it'll take you five seconds it'll take

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,420
me all day and so that was a clear

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,910
example of putting roadblocks in in

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,890
someone's way rather than saying you

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,000
know thanks for the contribution and if

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:52,770
you want to get more involved here's

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,959
these other things that you can do I am

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:59,110
frequently heard to say that you should

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:01,750
give out commits rights like candy our

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,420
open source projects are in revision

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,950
control all of them if they're not

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,720
you're doing something wrong but you

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,640
already know that you know 20 years ago

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,860
not everybody used revision control now

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,670
everyone does and the purpose of

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,070
revision can

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,660
is largely if somebody makes this

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,899
mistake it's easy to fix

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:24,339
so there is no risk in giving somebody

00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:26,350
commit rights the the risk the risk of

00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:29,620
giving somebody commit rights too early

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:32,410
is that they'll make a mistake right the

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,140
risk of giving them commit light rights

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:37,750
too late is that they'll go away and

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:41,160
never come back which it to me is

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:46,779
clearly the larger the larger risk and

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,670
so I always encourage projects to give

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:50,709
away commit rights as though there was

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,720
no cost because there's no cost if

00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:56,230
somebody's passionate give them commit

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,269
rights and let them play along you know

00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,670
make sure you have a rollback plan but

00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:06,310
you do because you're using revision

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:09,070
control now often when I say this I get

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:12,269
a couple of objections people saying we

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:16,709
can't give out commit rights because and

00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:20,230
these may be legitimate concerns but I

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:23,310
think that they are all fixable so the

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:29,230
first one is they're not trusted yet and

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:32,560
I have encountered in my years of open

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:35,980
source people I can count on one hand

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,540
who legitimate gave me legitimate

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,490
reasons for not trusting their

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,279
contributions to a project people that

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:46,149
were actively malicious people that were

00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:48,459
committing out of ill will and it's

00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:52,209
incredibly uncommon for somebody to come

00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:56,769
to contribute to your project and be

00:12:52,209 --> 00:13:00,370
fundamentally untrustworthy on the other

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:02,740
side of this the best way to make

00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:05,560
someone trustworthy is to trust them if

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:09,209
you give trust to somebody they will

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:13,170
generally speaking reciprocate

00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:15,310
withholding trust being suspicious

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,890
communicating that you're suspicious is

00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:20,620
a great way to tell somebody that

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,690
they're not welcome and to make them

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,430
feel like they're they're not ever going

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,209
to be a full member of your of your

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,209
little Club

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,150
the other risk you know I already

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,820
mentioned is that they might break

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,860
something and that's why we have

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:40,180
revision control that's why we have CI

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:42,910
that's why we have a review a code

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,200
review process if your project lacks any

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,470
of those things that I just mentioned

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,350
then fix that rather than trying to

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,180
chase people away now there there are

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,550
legitimate cases where you don't want to

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,130
hand out commit rights if you're running

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,080
the infrastructure that supports your

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,240
organization you don't want to give

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,270
route to everybody that that comes up

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,750
and offers to help there are things that

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:09,970
are in fact very expensive to break if

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,800
somebody screws up your backups or takes

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,970
down your mail server or does anything

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:18,130
to any of your production services then

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,100
perhaps you need a development and test

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,050
server to run this stuff on and that is

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:27,220
a situation where it's legitimately good

00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:31,060
thing to to hold back on what rights you

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:34,240
give but if it's code you know maybe

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:37,120
give them a branch or actually have a CI

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,270
process within the Apache Software

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,400
Foundation we have these terms review

00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:47,350
then commit or commit then review in

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,180
modern software development review then

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,660
commit is becoming more and more common

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,540
where your your patches have to go

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,930
through a review and CI process before

00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,310
they'll ever hit the source tree for the

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,100
last five years I've been working on the

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:07,630
OpenStack project and every time you

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:09,880
submit a patch to OpenStack it spins up

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,380
thousands of virtual machines to test

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,640
this thing and it runs it through all

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,680
their I mean even when you're changing

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,650
the documentation it goes through the

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,870
entire test suite and and that that's a

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,570
way when you have code that is truly

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,700
sensitive and complex that's a way that

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:27,850
things can be thoroughly tested before

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,730
they're ever committed the the

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,640
commitment review model makes sense for

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:36,070
things that aren't quite as sensitive

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:40,740
perhaps you don't really need a full

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:43,240
review cycle on documentation changes

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,430
perhaps you don't need a full review

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,089
cycle when you're updating the the test

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,860
infrastructure but it's it's a good

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,990
thing to have it's a good thing to have

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,199
these sort of commit hooks that that put

00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:58,899
everything through the through their

00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:01,689
paces before it gets committed it's a

00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:05,019
little bit of a sidetrack from my main

00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:07,509
topic getting back to it social

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:10,449
permission is often a lot harder to give

00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:12,970
than technical permission because you

00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:14,620
know we've been working on this code and

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,910
these are the newcomers and they don't

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,170
know anything and they don't have our

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:23,199
experience and they're that we tend to

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:27,309
hold on very tightly to the things that

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:31,870
we hold dear but giving this permission

00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:34,589
is a critical step in in welcoming new

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:37,839
members this social permission that says

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:40,059
you are allowed to do this so one of the

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:45,730
first ways that you can do this is give

00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:48,879
people time when you see a bug don't fix

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:51,459
it right away if it's not critical if it

00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:54,220
is not breaking the world give somebody

00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:58,269
else a chance to fix this go out of your

00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,009
way to document this problem maybe even

00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:01,899
a suggestion of how to fix it

00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:03,699
this is gonna take more time than just

00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:06,069
fixing it a lot of the time and that's

00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:08,500
why a lot of people don't do this but

00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:11,110
remember that you are investing in the

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,899
future of your project and so it is

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:16,689
worthwhile taking that time to encourage

00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:18,730
someone else to fix that problem because

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,079
the next time around they're gonna fix

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,230
it and you won't have to and you'll have

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:26,169
saved that much time so think long term

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:29,830
rather than short term and give people

00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:31,770
the time to fix a problem even though

00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:36,490
you already know the right way to do it

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:39,250
give them a chance to try and fail give

00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:44,799
them gentle encouragement towards a good

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:47,529
solution now when tasks get done really

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,549
quickly it can be very discouraging to

00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:53,030
beginners and I found over the last 10

00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:56,180
years or so

00:17:53,030 --> 00:18:00,350
that this is amplified by increased

00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:02,240
corporate involvement in open-source and

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,820
I've noticed this even more at Red Hat

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,830
where you have where you have projects

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,570
that have a an overwhelming number of

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,310
the contributors are from Red Hat and

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,540
they're working forty hours a week on it

00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,910
and then you have the folks that are

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,620
working on their weekend so Sunday

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,140
afternoon they look at the code they

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:21,980
identify a problem they work on it for

00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:25,190
an hour and then you know they go to

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:29,570
their real job on Monday Friday evening

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:32,300
they come back that problem has already

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,030
been fixed by someone else in a

00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,760
different way and committed and all of

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,740
their work was wasted and they have

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,640
wasted their weekend and their wife's

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,750
mad at them and their kids are irritated

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,570
that they didn't take them to the park

00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:51,410
and the next weekend I'm not going to

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:53,930
spend my time doing that and so you have

00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:57,950
the the big corporate monster chasing

00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:59,240
crushing the hobbyist and this is not an

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,310
easy problem to solve if you have a

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,160
solution to this I want to hear about it

00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:07,910
because it's a problem that I face every

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:12,050
day in my day job where the hobbyist

00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:13,610
contributor is actively discouraged not

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,710
because people are being unkind people

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,120
are doing a good job they're doing the

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,910
job that they're paid to do

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:25,910
but that contributor is made to feel

00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:28,480
useless so this is a hard problem the

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:32,810
next thing that I would ask you to do is

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:36,260
explicitly ask people to do things and

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:38,960
and this goes with code it also goes

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,120
with you know I run a number of small

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,710
events and I'll throw a call for papers

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,080
out on the mailing list and nothing

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,480
happens but if you approach an

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,770
individual and say I've been watching

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,990
the work that you're doing in this

00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,120
project I would like a talk from you on

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:57,050
this topic you'll have an abstract

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,300
within a half an hour asking people is

00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:03,560
much asking people personally

00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:05,300
individually to do specific things it

00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,740
does a number of different things one is

00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,270
it

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,500
lets them know that they're allowed so

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,820
this goes back to the giving permission

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,220
90% of the time when I ask somebody

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,530
directly to submit a talk for a

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,770
conference their first response is I

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:26,690
really don't have anything to say and I

00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:28,730
feel stupid up on stage and do you know

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,960
if you if you walk them through this and

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,550
show them that in fact what they're

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,210
doing is really cool and everybody wants

00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:37,250
to know about it

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:38,840
that gives them permission and you know

00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,070
we think I said it on the mailing list

00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,780
of course they know that they have

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,460
permission but that's not always the

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,670
case

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:49,760
the second thing that it does is a

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:51,890
slightly nuanced difference it lets them

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,370
know that you believe that they can do

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:58,309
it I am standing here today on this

00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:00,230
stage because someone told me that I

00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:02,690
could give a conference presentation and

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,940
my response was I have nothing to say

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,790
and I would feel stupid up on stage and

00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,590
he said you've been doing these things

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:13,820
and I want you to come to my event and

00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:17,540
talk about them that was 18 years ago

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:20,030
and I speak at a dozen conferences every

00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:23,720
year and and it's because of that one

00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:25,970
moment and it it told me that ken

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,070
believed that I could do it even though

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:32,830
you know he probably didn't and he was

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,830
just being nice but I did it right

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,690
another nuance on that is it lets them

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,520
know that they are trusted it lets them

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:44,120
know that the community trusts them it

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,160
lets them know that what they're going

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,520
to produce is going to be accepted and

00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,530
trusted as good enough telling somebody

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:56,840
that they're trusted makes them trust

00:21:51,530 --> 00:22:00,230
themselves more now here's another

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,670
nuance on the same concept this is kind

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,740
of playing the guilt card a little bit

00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,270
it lets them know that the community is

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,059
counting on them and if they don't step

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,530
up something's going to break now

00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:14,360
different ones of these work better with

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:18,110
different people but this this tells

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,910
them that you know maybe they need to

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,450
step out of what they've been doing and

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,860
action

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,510
doing something that they're not

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,610
terribly comfortable with because the

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:30,010
community is counting on them and it's

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:33,830
not going to get done otherwise and then

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:35,960
the last thing in this particular train

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,370
of thought is that it shows them what

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,500
they should do the next time and this

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:42,530
this is really rewarding for me as a

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,540
mentor where I will say to somebody I

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:47,090
need you to step up and do this thing

00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,970
and then a year later I see them doing

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:53,090
that same thing to another junior

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,130
developer saying you should step up and

00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,330
do this thing and knowing myself that

00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,370
that person could do a better job

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,010
they're handing it off to their junior

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:03,470
in order to to model what we've done and

00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:09,080
so it's it's extremely rewarding to

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:11,990
watch this now this is Ken I mentioned

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,260
Ken earlier Ken core is one of my oldest

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,750
friends in 1999 he said you need to

00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,520
submit a conference paper to this new

00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:25,520
event that we're doing called Apache con

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:28,010
and I did that and Apache con has become

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,920
in in many ways my life work I've been

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:34,820
I've been producing Apache con for 18

00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:37,250
years now because Ken asked me to submit

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:42,260
this paper that I knew that I had

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:44,540
nothing to speak about this is my wall

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,850
in my office these are conferences that

00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,770
I've spoken at and and I'm not saying

00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:53,240
this to say look at me I'm wonderful and

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:56,360
I'm saying this to say can invested his

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:59,750
time in me so that I can can be here

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,250
investing my time in other people here's

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,950
here's another individual he's actually

00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,800
sitting in the back of the room here in

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:09,650
1998 I was complaining about the

00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,590
documentation of an open source project

00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:17,360
called the Apache web server and he said

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:19,730
well then go fix it and I thought huh I

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,150
never thought of that

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:26,660
maybe maybe I'll go do that over the

00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,730
course of the next 15 years I and a half

00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,590
dozen other people completely rewrote

00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,200
all of the documentation and we're darn

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,690
proud of it we think that it is amazing

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:43,019
documentation

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:45,409
I wrote these books and I owe this to a

00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:49,379
moment where Jim said go fix it yourself

00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:55,200
here's the here's the commit bit just

00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:56,789
just go do it this is Sally ku dari she

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,279
is the marketing director of the Apache

00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:01,740
Software Foundation a little over ten

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,330
years ago she said you should run for

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,399
the Board of Directors of the Apache

00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:08,669
Software Foundation and I said there is

00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:11,899
no way I'm going to do that that's so

00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:16,740
far out of what I'm comfortable doing

00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:19,110
I'm now serving on my fifth term I think

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,679
on the board it took me a few years to

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:24,870
get around to it but I did eventually

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:29,789
run for the board and and was was

00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:31,529
elected now once again I'm not trying to

00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:33,480
say these things to say look at me look

00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:38,250
how wonderful I am what I'm saying is

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:40,230
that you have the opportunity to unlock

00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:45,720
potential in people who think they don't

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:48,750
have any and you have the opportunity to

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:53,490
to change someone's life by encouraging

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:56,490
them to do things mentoring is really

00:25:53,490 --> 00:26:00,059
truly a path to immortality you are you

00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:02,759
are creating the future by encouraging

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:06,590
somebody to do something that that they

00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:09,870
didn't think they could do my wife is

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:13,350
she's a silversmith among other things

00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:18,059
she is a a very talented artist and this

00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:19,799
is a poster that's on her wall Pablo

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:22,799
Picasso said I'm always doing the things

00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:24,929
I can't do in order to be able to do

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,990
them and so you know my wife has taken

00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:30,179
this to heart and whenever she feels

00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,879
that she's pretty good at a particular

00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:35,549
medium in art she abandons it and starts

00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:37,830
something else and so she has all of

00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:40,559
these different all of these different

00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,929
arts that she has that she's mastered by

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,789
just going and doing them so she made

00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:46,320
all the the rings that I'm wearing by

00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:47,549
the way if you want to if you want to

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:53,850
buy them I can give you her busy

00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:55,590
card but all that to say encouraging

00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,679
people into things that they're not

00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,330
comfortable with will very much change

00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,129
their lives there's there's a video

00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,769
linked down here I'll give you the link

00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:08,249
to my slides later Casey Neistat

00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:10,470
is a YouTube movie maker and he has this

00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:11,029
wonderful short film called do what you

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,070
can't

00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:16,889
about doing the things that people tell

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,539
you you can't do people say there's

00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:20,429
there's no way you're gonna succeed at

00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:23,960
that and that is the thing that you

00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:27,629
should grasp and and try to do so

00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,369
alright back to asking people how to do

00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:31,950
things there's a couple a couple ways

00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:35,429
that you should ask one is to be very

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:38,190
specific don't tell people come help me

00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:39,600
on my project because they will be

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,570
overwhelmed and they'll come look at

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,950
your project and they will don't know

00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:49,529
they won't know where to start tell

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:53,009
people I want you to work on this task

00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:55,109
be as specific as possible in in one

00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:57,450
regard this is what this is what you're

00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:59,129
ticketing system is about but if you

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,600
have a thousand open tickets in your

00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:06,509
ticket system it's extremely

00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:09,389
overwhelming giving people a I'll come

00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:11,730
back to the thing later about specifying

00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:14,999
what are good starter tickets but that's

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:17,549
that's one thing you can do another

00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:20,279
thing that you can do is encourage

00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:23,279
people to answer questions this is this

00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:27,419
is my primary way of mentoring over the

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:30,419
last 10 years is via IRC I I find people

00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:32,460
that are that are clearly asking good

00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:35,159
questions and maybe answering some of

00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,669
them and when someone asks a frequently

00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:41,129
asked question I don't answer it I say

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:43,739
why don't you ask this person who has

00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:46,169
demonstrated some some knowledge and

00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:50,940
they'll answer that and then gradually

00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:52,470
they they build their confidence I've

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,460
heard this referred to as micro

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:59,039
mentoring it takes 30 seconds to do and

00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,200
it has a lasting impact on somebody's

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:05,909
sense of their own ability

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:10,679
geez another way to ask is to set

00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:14,309
specific expectations you need to not

00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,799
just let people stomp all over your code

00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:19,950
you have code standards you have style

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:23,809
standards you want to make sure that

00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:26,399
those are met tell people when you are

00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:29,399
asking them to do something tell them

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:32,100
this is due on Tuesday and you need to

00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:34,139
meet our style guidelines now this has a

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,360
number of side effects it's not just

00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,919
it's not just making it harder for them

00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,080
in fact it's making them making it

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,120
easier for them it shows them exactly

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,529
what standard they have to rise to it

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,710
lets them know when they're done and

00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:48,389
also if you say it's due on Tuesday then

00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,700
you should check in with them on Sunday

00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:52,470
and say how's it going because if

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,019
they're not making any progress maybe

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:58,590
you need to give them more time or give

00:29:55,019 --> 00:30:00,809
the task to somebody else another thing

00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:03,539
that you need to do when you ask is to

00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:07,139
offer to help make sure you explicitly

00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:09,539
say I can help you in these ways don't

00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:11,250
do it for them don't help them so much

00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,929
that they're not doing it themselves but

00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,570
make it clear that they have a safety

00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:17,399
net make it clear that if they can't get

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:20,250
it done by Tuesday the world's not going

00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:25,860
to fall apart but that that's your

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:31,919
expectation never ever be condescending

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:35,669
assume competence and and and only offer

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,950
help when it's needed don't jump in and

00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:40,049
help somebody just because they're

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,429
they're not doing it to your standards

00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:43,679
or as fast as you would have thought

00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:47,190
because that communicates a lack of

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,480
trust and then when they're done make

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,370
sure you give them credit

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,220
don't take the credit for yourself even

00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:56,429
if you did 75% of the work give them the

00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:59,370
credit and praise them publicly and that

00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:03,240
goes a long way towards making people

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,559
feel ownership of the code several of

00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,480
the projects that I've been involved

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,600
with over the last few years

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:13,019
list every single contributor to a new

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,100
release OpenStack listed 1925

00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:17,230
contributors to the latest release

00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:22,809
I named on their in the release notes

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:26,049
and my name's on their and I feel really

00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:27,880
good about that the world doesn't have

00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:30,340
to know that I changed two lines of

00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,980
documentation but my name is in the

00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,580
release notes and that's really cool

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:39,220
WordPress does this too I it's it's a

00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,960
habit I think we should all get into and

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,880
once again even if you helped make sure

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,520
that they get the credit for their

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,169
change even if you commit their patch

00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,520
for them make sure that you put their

00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:54,400
name in the commit message now when

00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,650
you're asking it's a good idea to have a

00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,289
list of things to ask them to do and you

00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:03,700
do this by identifying good starter

00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:06,010
tasks tasks that are good for a beginner

00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,650
often people will tag these in their

00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:11,559
ticket systems as easy fix or good first

00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:12,880
bug or beginner so that somebody can

00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:14,169
look at your ticket system and

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,840
immediately pick out something that

00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:18,549
won't take them three weeks that they

00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,340
have a chance of doing and will help

00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:23,679
them learn more about the codebase

00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:26,530
here's an example of this from the from

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,630
the WordPress ticket tracker and what I

00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:33,490
want you to notice on this is how much

00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:35,530
work this person went into to document a

00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,600
problem that could literally they could

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,799
have fixed in a minute and a half they

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,799
took a screenshot

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,500
they put a call-out arrow on it and they

00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:46,870
described the problem in detail and that

00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,049
is so that a beginner can come and fix

00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,690
this and learn more about the plug-in

00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:54,400
system and go away with a feeling of

00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,740
accomplishment even though this

00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,059
individual knows the code inside and out

00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:06,010
could have fixed it in no time

00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:10,690
this is the easy fix cue in in OpenStack

00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:15,100
and it's a list of bugs that that art

00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:17,049
exhaustively documented step-by-step how

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:21,190
to reproduce the problem and how to fix

00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:23,500
it and you know Chandan is another guy

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,870
that that knows the code inside and out

00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,730
he could have done this in less time

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,960
than it took him to write this up but

00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,520
because he wrote this

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,760
we have two new contributors on the

00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,760
project so this is this is a big win

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,830
here's a couple websites again I'll give

00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:44,770
you my slide URL at the end these are

00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:48,159
some websites that are that I've used in

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,399
the examples now you may think that

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,110
contributing to your project is is

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:56,039
intuitive it's not nobody knows how to

00:33:53,110 --> 00:34:01,690
do it every project is different has

00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:04,510
unique quirks and irritations and you

00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:06,130
need to document that process and then

00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,230
watch somebody go through your

00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,629
documentation and every time they pull

00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:13,599
their hair out make sure that you

00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:16,899
clarify that point that was irritating I

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,960
I did a podcast interview yesterday with

00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:23,409
some people from the open source

00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,330
diversity org project and the front and

00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,580
center on their website is this article

00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,440
called your first pull request and it

00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,720
walks you through step by step your

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,520
first pull request because you know if

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:38,770
you've been doing it for a few years it

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,330
seems obvious but it's not I'm close to

00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,740
running out of time I want to talk about

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,050
one more thing and which is who you

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,849
should mentor once again if you mentor

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:50,679
Alexander the Great and he destroys the

00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:52,570
world that's on you so be careful one

00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:54,580
category of people that I recommend

00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:57,730
mentoring is the ones who ask good

00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:00,339
questions the the irritating questions

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,890
that make you actually go back and think

00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:04,690
why on earth did we do it that way these

00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:06,580
are the people that are going to take

00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:09,730
your product in to your project in the

00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,140
next step because they're asking these

00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:15,490
deep questions that you've stopped

00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:17,440
thinking about and documentation is is a

00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,240
great way a great place for those people

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,920
say why did you describe it that way and

00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,619
your answer is not because that's how it

00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,849
works your answer is help me understand

00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:27,940
how you would have understood that

00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:30,130
better the people that are they're

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,740
especially irritating and always argue

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,300
about things tell you that the way

00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,280
you've done it is really stupid these

00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,310
are good people to mentor as well push

00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,619
down your irritation push down your your

00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,880
sense of wounded pride and and mentor

00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:45,220
those people

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,230
also recognize that your mailing list is

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:50,140
not the only place where conversations

00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:52,300
happen and watching conversations other

00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,580
places is a great way to identify people

00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,640
that you should be mentoring and bring

00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:00,970
into the community we have two people on

00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,640
the Apache web server documentation IRC

00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,020
channel that that we brought over from

00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,730
Stack Overflow because they were

00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,260
answering questions brilliantly there

00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:12,390
and we're trying to bring them into the

00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:16,030
documentation project people that

00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:19,150
contribute a lot to peripheral things

00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:21,580
plugins modules etc are often good

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,710
people to mentor because they understand

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:28,870
an aspect of your product that that you

00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:31,210
may not everyone else you know we have

00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:35,140
limited time we have very limited time

00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:36,730
who we can choose to mentor but there

00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:43,720
are some people that I would encourage

00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:46,510
you to avoid I hate the word mentees it

00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,780
always makes me think of of the aquatic

00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:52,120
mammal manatee but some people are

00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,620
looking for something to put on their

00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,560
resume and that's the only reason that

00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,780
they're participating and these people

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,150
are often hard to identify but once you

00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,790
identify them you may not want to invest

00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:07,540
your life in them some people are trying

00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:09,340
to achieve the fame and adulation that I

00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,200
have standing up here on stage you know

00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,930
everybody loves me right so they want

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,540
they want to skip that process and jump

00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:18,280
to the end and and it's hard work and

00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,800
you you might not want to invest your

00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,640
life in those people another thing that

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,230
we find a lot on on support channels is

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,430
people that are asking you to do their

00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:33,040
homework and these are often easy to to

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:35,440
spot because they ask their question in

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,710
a way that clearly comes from a take

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,960
home exam and this is probably not

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:47,440
somebody that you want to invest a great

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:50,650
deal of time into so to conclude the the

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,140
best way to amplify yourself is by

00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:56,170
mentoring other people to follow after

00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,500
you and so you you want to clone your

00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,260
effort

00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,640
now I've chosen this picture here

00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,740
intentionally and ironically because as

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,250
you can obviously tell it's a bunch of

00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:08,890
white men and I I want to especially

00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:11,350
encourage us those of us in the audience

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:14,050
who are white men not to simply clone

00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:16,510
ourselves identify people that think

00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:18,760
differently from yourself and invest

00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:22,360
your life in them because they will in

00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,490
turn make you a better person if if you

00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,220
just go looking for people that are just

00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,860
like you then your community will always

00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:34,570
be just like you and you won't ever have

00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:36,730
any new ideas so I used the term cloning

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,910
here extremely ironically do not clone

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:43,060
yourself expand your pool of ideas or

00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:47,260
you'll just be a stagnant pond mentoring

00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:50,530
is a way to influence the future it's a

00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,870
way to extend your impact years beyond

00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,000
your life and you know none of us are

00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:59,080
getting any younger

00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:02,200
so thank you so much for your time I

00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,270
hope I've left enough time for questions

00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,340
if there are any these are ways to get

00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:09,720
in touch with me all of my slides are at

00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:13,480
box of clue com

00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:16,559
thank you yeah please thank for rich

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,559
[Music]

00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:22,470
we don't really have much time for

00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:25,510
questions unless like very quick one

00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:29,920
otherwise after the coffee break we'll

00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:40,360
have extra time so is there a quick

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:43,240
question thank you rich just have a

00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:46,330
question about you asked about what were

00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,610
some of the ways that you could have a

00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:53,320
better balance and contributing time

00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:55,990
between work and home and and your

00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,030
personal time and and one of the things

00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:01,900
I just wanted to share with you is that

00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:04,870
as an engineering manager one of the

00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:07,600
things I have tried to do is in order to

00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:10,050
encourage everybody on the team every

00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:14,800
engineer on the team to contribute to

00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:18,310
actually factor in 20% time on work time

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,920
to be able to work on you know their

00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,690
projects or areas that they're

00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,160
contributing to an open source and that

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:27,340
seems to work quite well so it's about

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,620
one one day a week and I know that

00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:33,310
sounds you know like a lot of time but

00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:36,670
it is actually very rewarding because

00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:39,640
that circles back around into everybody

00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:42,160
being too able to contribute to other

00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,500
aspects of their feature or development

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,410
- that's a good point to it so hopefully

00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,150
that you know adds back to you so if

00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:53,680
you're if you're a manager and you have

00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:55,930
that opportunity yes do that anyway that

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,200
was just I just wanted to add that Thank

00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:01,680
You Ella we go thank you very much thank

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,680
