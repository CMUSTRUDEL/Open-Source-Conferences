Description: 
	The Apache Incubator: Raising up projects to raise up the world

Do you have a project idea that could make the world a better place? First and foremost Apache Software Foundation projects are communities. Just as software is made by communities, it is made to support communities. In this talk we will describe how the ASF incubator helps develop communities.

	00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,179
hello everybody we've got a fairly small

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,420
audience so I will notice if you're not

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,430
paying attention

00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,429
my name is Merle this is Dustin

00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:21,419
McLean we're going to talk today about

00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:23,669
the Apache Software incubator so first

00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:27,449
off a little bit about our backgrounds I

00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:30,630
am an individual contributor for Apache

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,260
finish for also for the the Apache

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,120
community and I'm also the PMC chair of

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,340
Apache for interact which is a recently

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,230
graduated project we graduated in April

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,560
of last year I've had nearly 20 years of

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,940
software development experience and

00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:53,240
mostly in the areas around API

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:57,030
development and rest development and

00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,010
this is Justin Justin hi everyone I'm

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,990
Justin my voice is a little bit croaky

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,460
but I think it's going to last this talk

00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,829
I mentioned up there is I'm a bit of a

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,109
released enthusiast I went through the

00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,789
incubator list the other day and counted

00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:16,439
out how many releases I had voted on and

00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:17,460
the answer was 305 which I'll talk a

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,670
little bit about that later

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,950
I'm also VP of Apache minut which is a

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,479
real-time operating system and very

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:36,539
recently the VP chair of the incubator

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:38,609
itself so everyone here is obviously

00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:43,560
aware of the Apache photos Software

00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:46,770
Foundation yes good okay so the Apache

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,029
Software Foundation makes software open

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,899
source software for the public good

00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:53,279
there they're actually the corporate

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:59,069
structure is even set up that way so

00:01:53,279 --> 00:02:00,869
there are charity and the Apache

00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:07,590
Incubator is just one of the many

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:10,590
projects that is part of Apache and it

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:15,150
is where projects come to learn how to

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:18,450
become an Apache project and

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:23,069
more importantly is how they can grow

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,660
and build their communities so in this

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:28,170
presentation we're going to cover the

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,270
incubation process itself

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,959
Merle's going to talk about global

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:37,590
poverty and and how to solve that very

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:41,220
hard problem and also go through her

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,860
experience for with the going through

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,209
the incubation project and finally we're

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,790
going to talk about you know how do you

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:52,410
succeed in becoming a successful project

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:55,470
open source project um now we're not

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,410
lawyers we mention a few legal issues

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:07,019
here if you need legal advice please go

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:09,870
ask a real lawyer here be dragons so

00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,069
what does the Apache Incubator it's

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,590
basically the entry point where all

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:19,799
Apache not all but most of hatchery

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:21,570
projects come into and they sent spent

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,239
some time in the incubator usually

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:29,100
between a year or two learning about

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,810
Apache and the Apache way hopefully

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:38,340
growing their community and then

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:40,109
becoming a top level project so why

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,470
would you want to bring your project to

00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:46,530
Apache and the in the first plots you

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,870
need to there's certain things that your

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,430
project has to follow in in order to do

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,549
that and to become an Apache project

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,340
being open and transparent is is

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,540
probably the most important one

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,239
everything that goes on in a project

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,260
needs to be discussed in the open on on

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:09,569
the mailing list also Apache is very

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:13,859
strong on individuals and not companies

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:16,440
companies cannot buy a seat on either

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:19,859
the project management committee or on

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,169
the board and Apache and everyone who

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,760
acts at Apache is acting as an

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,860
individual not the company they work for

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,750
and you have to make that distinction

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,990
very very clear and they take some

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,069
projects or quite a long

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,910
to sort of get used to that and so it

00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:37,060
can be quite tricky

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,759
um there's no been vanilla the dictators

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,729
for life there's no one everyone is

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,590
equal on the project some people may

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:46,210
have slightly more responsibilities if

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,979
you're a committer you have a slightly

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,370
more responsibility than the user and if

00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:53,560
you're part of the PMC then you have

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,479
slightly more responsibility again but

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,789
everyone's voice is it is basically

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:01,270
equal and everyone can discuss and

00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:03,970
comment on if a user votes on a release

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,009
that vote is and actually binding but

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,750
you know people will still listen to it

00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,919
particularly if a lot of people say oh

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,449
now we've got something really wrong

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,449
here we need to we need to fix this up

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:19,090
so why do we actually go through an

00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:22,780
incubating process and the first thing

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,300
that you need to do is basically we want

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:33,630
to give Apache that is want to give

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:39,880
people the basically totally lost words

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:41,620
what they want to give people the

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,840
security I guess that anyone can take

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,729
some Apache software and use it and no

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,060
there's no legal issues there that's

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:51,550
what I was trying to say so that it all

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,750
all the licensing has been checked all

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,590
the IP of every single line of code is

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,590
documented and knows where it comes from

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,060
so anyone can take that and use that

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,969
under the terms of the Apache License

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,159
and make their business out of it um

00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:07,780
they also want to go through the

00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,469
incubating process to as I said learn

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,110
the Apache way and also to learn about

00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:16,750
ASF policy and there's policies there's

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,190
a huge number of policies there's some

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,190
legal policy there's some branding

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,110
policy and there's some release policy

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,320
and that's basically it

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,500
all right projects themselves are giving

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,530
are given a lot of freedom in how they

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,360
operate and what they can do but as they

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,820
do have these policies and guidelines

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,780
then they need to follow in order to

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,700
become an Apache project

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,680
so what is the Apache Way well it's it's

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:49,930
a sort of a hard thing to qualify it's

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:52,120
um it's a bit like Zen it's is sort of

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,950
once you know it you know it but if you

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,080
don't know it it's hard to explain to

00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,020
someone else but there are some cool

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,460
things behind there about it and that

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:10,240
includes collaboration community

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:11,500
consensus and being open the yeah I

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,630
don't think I'm gonna go any more into

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:18,810
it into that the apache license itself

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:22,150
allows anyone to take software that has

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,830
the apache license and use it for just

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,170
about any purpose they want there are no

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,530
restrictions of use and they can use it

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:32,770
for commercial purposes if they want

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,840
they can we would like that they get

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,640
involved in the project and you know

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,460
maybe contribute to it either help out

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,930
as users or raise some bugs or hopefully

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,170
commit some code but that's not a

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,000
requirement and we find that a lot of

00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,340
people do give back and some don't but

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,410
that's fun that's fine also we end up

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,240
with enough people that can help grow

00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:57,850
the project and and the community around

00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:00,490
the project that way the it's obviously

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,230
an open-source license and it's one of

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,400
the more permissive license there's a

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,190
few other licenses that are also

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:10,590
permissive MIT and BSD for example are

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:13,720
very similar in in in those terms

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,030
and and as I was saying before it means

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,260
that there are no legal issues that

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,750
you're gonna have if you have something

00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,550
that comes from the ISF and it has an

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,350
apache license on it you're pretty sure

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,420
that no one is will try and take you to

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,770
court to say you know you're using our

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:32,380
code or anything along those lines so

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:36,190
the incubator currently has 50 projects

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,060
in incubation it they generally stay in

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:42,310
incubation between one and two years

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,890
summer some are shorter summer long some

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:47,190
never leave the incubator at all I think

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:52,000
we've got I think the current record is

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:53,260
five or six years and there's about all

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
these pod links

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,850
as they're learning the process they

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,340
make releases and there's been about

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:03,610
around ten releases a month come out of

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,410
out of the incubator there so what do

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,350
you have to go through to actually get

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,880
into the incubator first off you need to

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,570
find someone who has done this before

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,820
and can guide you through the process

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:19,150
and they are your champion and they will

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,940
help you draft up a proposal and which

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:26,410
you'll then send to the incubator

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,720
mailing list for discussion just about

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,690
every single proposal that gets to that

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,760
stage will get accepted as an incubating

00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,220
project there are there are there's a

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,780
few cases where that hasn't happened and

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,120
quite often there'll be a lot of

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,490
discussion beforehand before it gets

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,650
sent to the list and that they may just

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:50,080
decide that no the ASF is not a good fit

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:53,650
for us because of whatever reason so

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,560
once you've got your proposal you need

00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,280
at least three Mentors and these are

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:06,220
people who have experience at Apache and

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:08,320
they're part of the incubator and they

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,110
can be their job is to help you through

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,480
the incubation process from start to

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,700
finish and that's hopefully what you end

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:20,110
up graduating and becoming a top-level

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:23,140
project from there so then there's a

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,700
discussion about the proposal and then

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,400
it will generally be bit put for a vote

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,680
and the incubator PMC will vote on it

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,420
and as I said it's very very rare that a

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,130
project does not get accepted if it's

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:38,200
got to that stage once it's been

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,540
accepted the puddling then gets

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,580
bootstrapped and that means setting up

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,220
servers setting up mailing lists setting

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,140
up version control setting up juror you

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,760
know all that sort of infrastructure you

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:53,320
need to be able to run the proof run the

00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:55,510
project apache hosts all of that for the

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:59,050
project there's no charge to the project

00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,640
and in that regards and occasionally

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,140
projects can ask for a few you know

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,880
different things not all projects so

00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,400
that they're the same and some times

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,230
requirements are

00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:11,940
little different you need to check that

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:15,360
all of the initial committees that are

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:19,560
on the project have signed a contributor

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,890
agreement I CLA and that means that they

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:26,460
say I'm legally allowed to give you this

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:29,040
code and it there's no there's no IP

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,600
issues with it and that if it generates

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,160
you know code you've written yourself so

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,290
you say you're giving up your IP rights

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,660
to that code um if the code if there's

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,210
there's usually projects that come to

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,740
the incubator will already have a

00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:47,190
community around them and they'll have a

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:50,310
large code base that that software needs

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,900
to come in via software grant and again

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,880
that's just the the same sort of thing

00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,190
it's it's saying like here's this all

00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:03,270
this code that we're doing donating the

00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:05,430
ASF now owns the IP of this code so then

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,020
the process is you need to look through

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,630
all the code and double check that

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,490
everything is is all correct and quite

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,860
often it's not quite often there will be

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,890
you know someone's copied some code from

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,590
somewhere or you know I know in my case

00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,910
I did minus one on a on a release

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,310
because they had a picture of a cat in

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,750
it so which was actually done by a

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,180
professional photographer and he owned

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,650
the copyright to the to the picture so

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,600
you have to go through and check that

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,760
everything is is correct as far as IP

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,930
goes and then you can start making

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,640
releases and hopefully once you start

00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,600
making releases and you get the word out

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:45,390
there and you talk about your projects

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,990
at conferences like this your community

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,910
grows you attract more people those some

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,700
of your users may become committers

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:58,650
themselves and that sort of keeps going

00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:00,480
and going and going so in order to grow

00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,910
your community though you have to follow

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,820
the principles behind the apache way and

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,710
that is making sure that you keep all

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,360
the discussion on the mailing list that

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:14,790
you are open and transparent about

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,600
everything and that you make sure that

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,740
people are

00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,310
acting at the best interests of the

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:27,620
project and not being you know a puppet

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:29,569
for a corporation and most of all one of

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,999
the things that we it's not hard

00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:33,709
requirement but people will projects

00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:36,170
will stay in the incubator for a lot

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:38,120
longer if this doesn't happen is that

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,279
the people that make up the project need

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,519
to be diverse they need to come from

00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:45,559
different companies they need the the

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,110
one thing we're really concerned about

00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:50,360
is that if all the committers are from a

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,839
single company that company changes

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,670
direction and then you know the project

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,449
doesn't exist anymore we want to try and

00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,449
stop that from happening

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,949
so then you decide this is us a year

00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:06,499
passes you've made three or four

00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:08,449
releases and you think you're ready to

00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:10,459
become a top-level project so what you

00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:12,379
do then is you've decided that you're

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,129
ready you decide that you can

00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:15,290
self-govern

00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:17,050
you don't need any help anymore your

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,509
mentors will still be around to help you

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,920
quite often after you graduate and you

00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:23,569
know sometimes those questions that come

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,459
up that that haven't come up during

00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:29,569
graduation and so you can discuss

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:31,730
becoming a top-level project on the

00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:35,870
mailing list again in the open and then

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:41,089
vote on it and assuming that vote passes

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:46,309
that's it you're a top-level project so

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:48,259
the voting on releases is a little

00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:52,579
different to some of the other voting at

00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:54,889
Apache and that is that the must be kept

00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:58,309
open for a minimum of 72 hours so that

00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:01,100
allows everyone to participate even

00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:05,899
people who in different time zones for

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:08,779
example and you need three plus one

00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:11,149
votes and more plus one votes than minus

00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:14,059
one votes a minus one is not a veto and

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:16,550
the whole idea behind this is that as

00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:18,589
long as it's good enough and better than

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,899
the previous release that's okay it

00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:23,449
doesn't have to be perfect if a release

00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:25,459
is perfect than if you've tried to make

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:27,050
a release perfect you'll never ever get

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,059
there there always be some little

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,669
problem with it

00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:33,319
you know that'll end up doing that so as

00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:35,449
long as the majority of people agree

00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:40,849
that it's a good release and it should

00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:43,899
be shipped then um this is the stats on

00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:47,239
Ohio I have voted on incubated releases

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:50,629
270 times I've voted plus one on a

00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:52,099
release 16 times I've voted plus zero

00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:56,179
because there was some issues there and

00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:57,709
I didn't feel what and in 72 cases I've

00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:59,689
said no sorry there's a there's a

00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:01,699
problem here we got to fix it and three

00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:08,899
of my releases are in those 72 by the

00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:11,209
way and so so that's about 71 percent of

00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,949
releases from me I've got the plus one

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:17,569
and I think I think that's sort of a a

00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:19,309
good indicator of you know and generally

00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:21,199
as a bottling goes you know through its

00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:22,609
lifecycle it gets better and better and

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,139
better at doing it so most of those

00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:26,439
minus ones are the you know the first

00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:29,419
were the second releases that come out

00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:31,369
um and as it doesn't have to be perfect

00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:33,859
and often you do make mistakes if it's

00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:35,329
not your first time doing this then it's

00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:40,569
quite likely you're not going to get it

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:45,519
right for the first time ever I saw a

00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:48,829
like the very first release candidate of

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,749
Portland's first release actually get

00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:55,069
voted plus one by everyone I've only

00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:56,689
ever seen that happen once so um and you

00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:58,879
may also not be filled you're not

00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:00,439
familiar with a s F policy at this point

00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,199
you know you're still learning the ropes

00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:04,879
and you still you know it's documented

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,529
but you know some of the documentation

00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:08,480
needs improvement some of it is

00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:10,339
scattered all over the place

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,959
so sometimes it's quite hard to work out

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,999
what you should do

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,889
also sometimes if you look at what other

00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:18,559
projects top-level projects are doing

00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:19,699
and try and copy them sometimes they're

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,829
not always doing the right thing either

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:30,919
either so you know you've got to be a

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:33,110
little careful about that sorry so yeah

00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:35,419
and basically it's just you don't want

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:39,500
to have any surprises in your release so

00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:41,299
if you if you know there's a problem in

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,680
the release documented and if you

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:44,570
document it then

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:49,900
you're still more likely to get the vote

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:52,910
to pass so now we're going to talk about

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,410
thinner act at Apache and I'm going to

00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,800
start by talking a little bit about what

00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,910
Finnick does what fitter act is so

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,650
everybody who knows anything about

00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,110
global poverty is probably going to tell

00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,390
me this is a really hard problem in

00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,800
capital letters this is a problem that

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,600
we can't solve there's no way we can

00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,310
solve it you think about starving

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,780
children in Somalia and then you're like

00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,820
that's terrible I feel bad about that

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,880
but I can't do anything about it

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,190
and if we look at this you can see that

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,250
starting in the 1820s global poverty

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,290
began to dramatically decline global

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,910
poverty in this case being being defined

00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,410
as the number of people making the

00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,560
yellow line the number of people making

00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,180
less than $2 a day

00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,740
adjusted for inflation the black or the

00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,810
red line then is the number of people

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,670
making less than one dollar a day again

00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:40,550
adjusted for inflation and the black

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,250
line on the right is one ninety a day so

00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:46,220
you see that through the Industrial

00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,870
Revolution around that time the number

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,780
the percentage of the worldwide

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,760
population living in global poverty has

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:56,240
gone dramatically down and at this point

00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,250
where we're headed towards dipping under

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,540
ten percent of the worldwide population

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,150
despite the fact that the worldwide

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,860
population has been growing under ten

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:09,410
percent of the worldwide population is

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:11,600
in living in poverty yes it's still far

00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,700
too high but we're making progress

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,480
against it so it must be a solvable

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,730
problem what if we want to solve the

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,470
problem what do we need to do well naive

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,480
person might say we just give everybody

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,270
enough money to have more than $2 a day

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,880
right well let's look at that naive

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,370
solution what would that mean this is

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,050
how much money it would cost if we were

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,850
to give everybody in the world who makes

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:37,690
less than $2 a day enough money to be

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,770
over that $2 a day mark and it's done

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,600
progressively you see the amount of

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,250
money the absolute amount of money that

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,160
would be required to do that has gone

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,750
down so we started in the 1980s at

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,320
around 5 over 500 million

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:56,450
we're actually below 150 million now so

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,009
clearly we are making progress but what

00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:02,690
we need to finish that what do we need

00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:09,259
to get that last step over over this to

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:10,820
get those last 10% well we know why

00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:12,649
we're making the progress we're making

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,559
it's because of the Industrial

00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:17,539
Revolution so we need something that

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,619
changes the playing field in the same

00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:20,480
way that the Industrial Revolution

00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:23,149
changed the playing field in this sort

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:31,129
of exponential way and one possibility

00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:33,409
is microfinance so there are two billion

00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:36,499
people on this planet who don't have

00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:42,049
bank accounts anybody here ever taken

00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:44,809
out a loan anybody here

00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:48,619
saving for like a vacation or for

00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:52,749
retirement yeah these are things that

00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:54,710
are core to our financial well-being I

00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:56,659
personally took out loans in order to

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,210
pay for my college education and I

00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:01,159
wouldn't be making I wouldn't be as

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:05,359
financially well-off today as I am

00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,649
without that if you don't have a bank

00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,749
account there are lots of things you

00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:11,119
just can't do that would make it

00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:18,789
possible for you to raise yourself out

00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:21,259
of poverty so in 1976 Muhammad Yunus

00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:24,470
was living in a village in Bangladesh

00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:26,809
and he noticed that there were women who

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,970
were building bamboo furniture who

00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:33,259
didn't have a lot of money who were

00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:35,269
trying to they were buying bamboo and in

00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:37,129
order to buy their bamboo they couldn't

00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:38,210
go to a bank to borrow the money the

00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,129
banks wouldn't give them the money they

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,139
were too poor they had to go to loan

00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:43,940
sharks and the loan sharks were lending

00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:46,279
them this money at exorbitant interest

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,200
rates so what he did was he just he lent

00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:52,639
these women their 42 women he lint them

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,139
$27 all of them together $27 they bought

00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:55,730
the bamboos they made the furniture they

00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:58,549
paid back the loan with a tiny bit of

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,950
interest and everybody was wealthier and

00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:03,080
microfinance was born so he took this

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,639
model and he spand it on it and he

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,580
founded a bank called the Grameen Bank

00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:10,249
in which he loaned tiny amounts of money

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,850
to poor people that they could then use

00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:12,590
to bill

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:18,980
businesses and to lift themselves out of

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:24,620
poverty and this was microfinance and it

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:27,440
continued by 1983 the project was turned

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,960
into a full-fledged Bank by 1997 the

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,899
Grameen foundation worldwide was founded

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,730
it works because poor people are just

00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:36,320
like rich people they want to be able to

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,019
contribute back to their societies they

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,580
want to build things they've even done

00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:42,380
some studies on this microphone is

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,889
actually is effective in lifting people

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,960
out of poverty so 55 percent of gramming

00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,679
customers who remain customers for five

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,570
years or more

00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,370
exit poverty and the average credit

00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,649
write-off is one percent the average

00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,149
overdue rate is between three and six

00:22:54,649 --> 00:23:03,320
percent so what does this have to do a

00:22:56,149 --> 00:23:06,080
software so before I before I go into

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:09,259
what this has to do a software this

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:14,509
model was ordered the Nobel Peace Prize

00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:16,879
in 2006 the the Nobel Prize Committee

00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:19,070
recognized that this was very impactful

00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:20,990
in in moving the world forward and one

00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,639
one thing about this that was a little

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,679
bit different one reason why you were

00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:25,669
able to go vend money to these to these

00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,549
poor people is something called

00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:31,129
solidarity lending so people would get

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:32,690
together into groups mostly women this

00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:34,399
was mostly targeted at women they would

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,549
get together in groups and they would

00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:39,139
say Lind one of our members the money or

00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:42,259
Lind all of us together as that money

00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:46,820
but as a group they would be able to say

00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:49,779
if she doesn't pay it back then we will

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:53,840
come together and make up the difference

00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:55,870
this just reduces the risk for the bank

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,940
because there's more people stepping up

00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,409
but it also has a couple of other NACA

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:04,220
knock-on effects so there's the

00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:06,200
additional social pressure positive and

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,570
negative other person who receives the

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,950
money and there is they have regular

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,080
meetings so that people can exchange

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,450
financial know how they can learn from

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,299
each other about how to run businesses

00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,549
successfully this is a form of community

00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,260
or this is an aspect of community that's

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:24,110
being leveraged here to lift people out

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,360
of poverty it's a community aspect that

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:29,580
I

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:31,140
so interesting about this so again what

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,500
does software have to do with this

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,320
well accounting is the oldest software

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,780
application there was there was

00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,400
accounting being done on computers of

00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,110
various sorts before computers were

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,730
really properly invented in their modern

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:50,429
form doing interest calculations

00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,559
requires a lot of mundane work that

00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:53,850
requires a great deal of care for a

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:59,760
human being that computers do very

00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:01,620
easily and big banks use closed source

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,780
systems because that was the first kind

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,500
of system there was out there they they

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,970
use these very expensive systems it cost

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,190
millions of dollars depending on the

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:14,040
system they can they can go as low as a

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:16,410
quarter of a million dollars a year or

00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,510
they can be massively expensive and if

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:22,080
you've got a small MFI who's serving a

00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:24,059
village with 30 people each of which has

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,160
a deposit of maybe two dollars you can't

00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,500
afford these systems you can't amortize

00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,770
it across a large number of relatively

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,179
wealthy customers but we've seen this

00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,280
kind of problem at open source before

00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:37,110
right how do we spread out the cost of

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:42,480
solving a problem across a large group

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:46,320
well in 2004 the Grameen Foundation

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,900
began to develop an open source solution

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,520
to banking and this solution was spun

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,400
off and it was became the Methos

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,620
initiative to me for software and this

00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,910
software was donated to the Apache

00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,380
Software Foundation in December of 2015

00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:04,410
in December of 2015

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,790
finner Act was born came to the Apache

00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:10,530
Software Foundation into the incubator

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:13,230
we were then in the incubator until

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:16,890
April of 2017 so we were in the

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:19,650
incubator for 15 months while we learned

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:22,130
about the Apache Way about the Apache

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:25,020
release process where we scrubbed our IP

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,280
and now we're looking at supporting the

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:30,960
next generation of financial inclusion

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:32,910
project products so now the cell phone

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,080
mobile coverage has increased which

00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,600
makes it possible to reach more

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,720
customers in rural areas at the same

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,180
time we have exciting news

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,820
Technologies like blockchain that we

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:45,790
need to work out how to or to what

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:49,930
extent to offer to people in need of

00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:51,640
financial inclusion products a report

00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,950
from the McKinsey Global Institute found

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,950
that delivering financial services by

00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,860
mobile mobile phone could add 3.7

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:03,040
trillion dollars to the GDP of

00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:05,380
developing countries by 2025 that's

00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,160
enough money to create 95 million jobs

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:11,920
and that is enough money to to lift

00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:19,570
those that last 10% out of poverty if

00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:20,950
it's distributed appropriately so what

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,020
was our process like well the first

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,150
thing we did was we found a champion as

00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,330
Justin mentioned earlier our champion

00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:30,550
was Ross Garza the next thing we did was

00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,020
we drafted well we picked a project name

00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,270
we couldn't heat the old project name

00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,420
because the me flows initiatives to

00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:39,760
existed as an independent entity I don't

00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:43,990
know if it was anybody here in was

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,030
anybody here in Shane's talk you can't

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,370
fork a brand right the me Foss brand

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:51,220
already exists so we had to pick a new

00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:54,610
name to exist under at the Apache

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,050
Software Foundation then we had to

00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,390
analyze the code and this was actually

00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:00,640
the hardest part was to find any

00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:04,510
dependencies in our code that would

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,600
inhibit somebody from using that code in

00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:10,720
their own projects looking basically

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,630
looking for GPL or LGPL dependencies and

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,000
then we write a proposal and send it to

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,410
the Apache Incubator list and then we go

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,090
into the process that Justin has already

00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,520
described you go through discussion

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:23,020
people ask questions we answer the

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,960
questions we say where we see the

00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:29,880
problems then there's a vote and we were

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,880
voted in in December of 2015

00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:36,730
Justin mentioned earlier that 70% of

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,950
release candidates are accepted by the

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:43,930
incubator this is true if you've already

00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,580
made a successful release that that sort

00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,040
of evens it out but we had a bit of

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,830
trouble at the beginning we tried we

00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,899
gave we made three releases they were

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:56,070
already

00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:59,470
thank you and I mean that seriously

00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,460
we made three release attempts I'm can

00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,629
you remember what some of the issues

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:06,639
were they were all GPL dependencies

00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:09,669
hibernate open J hibernate was we

00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:15,730
replaced with open GPA to resolve those

00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:18,460
issues so on our fourth try we made it

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,929
and we made another couple of releases

00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,019
and once we had shown that we could make

00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:24,759
releases and grow the community then we

00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:26,889
were able to graduate so what does grow

00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,899
the community actually mean well we have

00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:30,190
to propose contributors how do we

00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:31,690
propose contributors well we have a

00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,549
private mailing list and we do it on

00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:36,190
private so that if there somebody's

00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:38,519
rejected we don't hurt any feelings we

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:41,980
have a private mailing list and the

00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:45,820
project management committee that the

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,350
project started with proposes people who

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,139
have been making contributions as

00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,970
committers we say how about him how

00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:54,490
about her she's done this that and the

00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:59,169
other thing we're very happy with this

00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:02,769
and maybe we should give her access to

00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:04,029
the direct access to the repo or also

00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:07,450
the recognition that's involved with

00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:09,700
being a committer so you make that you

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,409
make a proposal some it's the same as

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,779
bringing the the project into the

00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:16,059
incubator you make a proposal people ask

00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:18,970
questions you answer them maybe there's

00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:20,940
some some controversy for the most part

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:28,570
in most cases at least in our project

00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:32,590
the committers were then voted in after

00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:34,480
we've done this for roughly a year we

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,909
went and said we think we're ready

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,429
thank you Bader is great but we're not

00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:41,230
learning much here anymore it's time for

00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:43,299
us to move on and it's time for us to

00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,279
free those resources resources so that

00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,230
other those mentors so that other

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:51,999
projects can come into the incubator

00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:54,850
under there they're a guiding hand so we

00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:57,070
sat down together and we said here are a

00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,539
list of things that we felt like we

00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:02,230
should be able to do before we leave the

00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:03,580
incubator can we do them yes no what do

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,630
we need to do a couple of things we

00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,450
wanted to change and we

00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,160
and then we put that put together a

00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,410
proposal sent it to the incubator and

00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:14,650
the incubator approved it and sent it

00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:17,710
onto the board once it reaches the board

00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,300
the board then says basically the board

00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,800
I don't know of any instance where the

00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,100
board hasn't followed the recommendation

00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,600
of the incubator know once that once the

00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,530
the incubator makes the recommendation

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,760
to the board but the board is the

00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,590
governing body of the Apache Software

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,450
Foundation and the board is the body

00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:37,630
that makes the resolution this is now a

00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:39,940
top-level project at Apache so this for

00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:42,580
me actually has this this process of

00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,130
building communities has a lot in common

00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,020
with what our customer and what fin our

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,610
customers are doing they are building

00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,220
communities or taking existing

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,720
communities and learning new things in

00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,640
those existing communities in order to

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,200
help support each other and to help

00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:03,030
support the rest of the world - yeah -

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,530
to make all of our lives a little better

00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:07,780
community is what makes this work the

00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:11,770
the willingness to reach out to another

00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:15,300
person and help them and to want to be

00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:17,700
able to do something for other people so

00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:23,080
how do you make the world a better place

00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:33,220
well contribute to a community and at

00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:35,800
this whites are there any questions well

00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,050
thanks for the presentation and just out

00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,720
of curiosity I was interested to know

00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,410
who was backing the contributors for

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,720
this community

00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:46,720
so what companies were employing them

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,950
and is it always good their relationship

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,400
with those companies or do you ever get

00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:53,110
like political pressure to get

00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,530
committees or users promoted to

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:59,020
commuters and so there are several

00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,370
companies you haven't heard of backing

00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,130
this starting with the Memphis

00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:05,440
initiative which is a nonprofit they did

00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,790
at that point paid contributors I was

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,360
working for the Memphis initiative when

00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:12,490
we entered incubation there's also a

00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,610
couple of companies that do service

00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,150
software as a service for MF eyes

00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:20,820
microfinance Institute's

00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:22,170
they so if there's Missoni for the

00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,050
netherlands and there's conflicts from

00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:27,450
india they also both have contributors

00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,460
and we also have a lot of individual

00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,140
contributors so we actually we rely

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,900
probably more than any other Apache

00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:37,500
project on contributions from google

00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:41,700
Summer of Code which requires a fair bit

00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:47,430
of organization and yeah at a patchy as

00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:50,100
a whole only about half the contributors

00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,170
are actually fully employed by a company

00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,070
at the other half at volunteers and do

00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:57,360
it in this spare time

00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:58,710
yeah and that's we like people doing it

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,980
in their spare time because they tend to

00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:03,660
be very passionate we also like people

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,110
doing it for companies because they tend

00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,820
to be very consistent these are these

00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:15,060
are two good things that you can combine

00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:16,220
together so yeah does that answer your

00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:23,460
question

00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:26,760
any more questions you mentioned that

00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:30,300
it's not so big problem if release is

00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:34,740
not excellent but what about if some

00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:38,610
other is still contain some problematic

00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:42,060
license code with problematic license is

00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:45,900
it a problem or did you take this um

00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:49,980
well it it's easily fixed you make

00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:52,230
another release so but all there is will

00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,540
be available from the Apache sides right

00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:56,790
you'll release will be fixed but what

00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,710
about dollar isn't it a problem well it

00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,970
depends what what sort of issues are

00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,980
you're talking about you know if

00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,510
something is broken and it doesn't work

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:10,050
you know kind of really know some gpo

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:11,670
problem if there's if a release produces

00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,690
some sort of legal jeopardy for the

00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:20,190
customers then it won't get released

00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:22,640
that's yeah the the like much those most

00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:25,050
of those minus one votes were there were

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,450
because they had compiled code in a

00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:29,820
source release the second most thing I

00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:32,220
vote minus one on is is because of in

00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,620
compatible licenses and that's usually

00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:40,010
fairly easy to check it's not often

00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:40,010
hidden so okay okay thanks

00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:50,880
one more question has it ever happened

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,150
that somebody some contributor out of

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,100
not knowing it's signed of these

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,650
intellectual like this this writes off

00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,990
and but but ever like did an error in

00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:05,460
this and and you ended up having

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:08,460
problems with contaminations in in terms

00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,550
of having code like I mean like because

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,790
it at some point contributors they sort

00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:16,860
of say that that they have the right to

00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:19,290
give if those those those things away

00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,880
but I mean as a human and if you've

00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,070
written a lot of code and you might not

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,500
know where you know if your practices

00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:27,600
aren't really completely clean and you

00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,790
might have gotten something from

00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,960
somewhere like ever happened or I can

00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,090
think of a couple cases where that has

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,580
happened and it's generally being found

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,990
out and fixed so that the offending code

00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,960
has been removed that doesn't mean that

00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:41,820
with you know every single case that was

00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,460
good it's generally fairly obvious

00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,310
because the code is not in the same

00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,140
style as the rest or there may be some

00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,970
odd comments or something in there like

00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,760
there's just a few little things that

00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:55,500
you can see that well trigger you to

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,030
think a well I wonder where that is from

00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,740
and these days you can just do a search

00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,510
on the internet and find if the code was

00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,100
from somewhere else and there you go I

00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,450
yeah okay that's where it came from and

00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,280
and this is where the four-eyes

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,560
principle or the twenty eyes principle

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,450
because it's very important is that's

00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,010
the only way to find things like that if

00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,720
you do find something like that then the

00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,550
only thing you can do is remove the code

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,040
and either just remove it or replace it

00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:19,740
well it depends what the license of the

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,360
code is okay yeah so it could actually

00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,070
become from somewhere else that had a

00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,360
compatible license and in that for

00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,770
you've just got to recognize that and

00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,950
say yep this code came from here and

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:30,420
that's all good so if you're curious

00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:33,090
about licensing issues we have a

00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,620
workshop right after this that we will

00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:39,360
be going in more detail through

00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:41,710
licensing and releases so any more

00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:45,640
questions I think we are

00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:48,630
on time by now so thank you very much
