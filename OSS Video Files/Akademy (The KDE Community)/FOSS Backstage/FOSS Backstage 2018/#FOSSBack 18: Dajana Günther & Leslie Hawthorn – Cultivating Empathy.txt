Title: #FOSSBack 18: Dajana Günther & Leslie Hawthorn – Cultivating Empathy
Publication date: 2018-06-21
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	When considering how to design products, teams, or even common every day household objects, empathy doesn't end up on the required features list. Yet, without empathy, teams with enormous technical skills can fail in their quest to deliver quality products to their users. Incredible projects fail to create communities because they don't exercise it. Fail at empathy, and your chances of failing at everything skyrockets.

Contrary to what you may have heard, empathy is not something you're innately born with - it's a skill that can be learned, cultivated, refined and taught to others. In this presentation, your lovely co-speakers will discuss the value of empathy, how you can cultivate it in yourself and your organizational culture, and conclude with concrete steps for leveling up in your interactions with your fellow human beings.

so welcome everyone thank you very much

00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,670
for coming this morning and before we

00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:14,470
kick off our presentation diana has a

00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:17,369
question for the audience my mic is on

00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:21,099
you know my mic is on thank you good

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:26,409
hoom of you has worked in a toxic

00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:28,689
environment before surprise almost

00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:31,839
universal yes

00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:34,840
okay so Bob we are we are hoping that

00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,129
today we can come away with some lessons

00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,420
learned and effective techniques for

00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:38,739
making sure that if you're working in

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,140
one of those toxic environments you can

00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:44,440
help to make it better or find your way

00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,230
out quickly yes so we met a few years

00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,300
before and of course we had some stories

00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,920
to share especially about toxic

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,500
environments and working in toxic

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,600
environments and so we thought we need

00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,149
to give a talk about empathy and how to

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,879
how to interact with other people other

00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:04,269
humans better and that's how we came up

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,040
with cultivating empathy and one of the

00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,130
things that I have found personally very

00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,900
gratifying in the area of empathy in our

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,060
work environments be that at our

00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,430
companies or projects or even within our

00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,970
own family dynamics is this conversation

00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:21,760
has sort of taken a center stage of late

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,200
as ways that we can make software

00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,860
development better and open-source

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,080
better so once upon a time I think we

00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,460
felt like you know there are folks over

00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,620
here doing coding they're all very

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,690
logical that squishy human stuff is not

00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,460
really their purview and you know maybe

00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,380
you have the the nice people over here

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,930
who are your community managers and they

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,510
deal with all the squishy human bits but

00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,770
if there's anything that our current

00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,730
times have taught us it's that we all

00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,440
need to be able to effectively

00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,360
communicate with one another in order to

00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,520
bring about positive change so again

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,850
we're hoping that we can give you some

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,520
concrete actions that you can take to

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,800
improve your life in your community at

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,870
your company and just generally when

00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,920
interacting with other people so that

00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,950
everyone has a more positive experience

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,649
yeah so let's introduce ourselves

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,410
because we are talking here and maybe

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:12,860
you don't know us so Lesley has been

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,100
working in open

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,140
NORs communities for over 12 years her

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,990
past projects include google Summer of

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:24,680
Code and she is actually the creator of

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:29,270
google code-in and she's living the life

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,310
of an expat here in Europe but of course

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,780
Berlin is her favorite city it really is

00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,210
I keep trying to get my husband to move

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,010
here and I haven't convinced him yet his

00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,030
family is from Stuttgart so he of course

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,850
thinks we should be living in the south

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,970
I may disagree but that's an opportunity

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,130
for me to exercise my empathy my dear

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,990
friend Diana who is the godmother of my

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,700
lovely little daughter has been an

00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,350
active participant in the Ruby community

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,720
here in Berlin for a long time

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,420
she's an organizer a past organizer of

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,550
the rails girls Berlin workshops former

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,290
board member of Ruby Evie and she's the

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,150
community manager for the go-to Berlin

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,850
conference have any of you folks in the

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,220
audience had the opportunity to attend

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,380
yeah excellent very nice to see you here

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,520
and I hope that Diana will get to see

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,130
you folks again in the go to Berlin

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,680
community yes all right

00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:20,090
that's right so why empathy matters for

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,040
someone like me who tends to think of

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,160
themselves as very empathetic I find

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,540
myself not asking this question very

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,030
often because to me it is just a

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,890
self-evident truth that empathy is vital

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,470
for all of our interactions but that's

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,870
not necessarily the case for everyone

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:40,070
first of all just to define empathy

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,570
empathy is the ability to be idiomatic

00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,260
phrases to put yourself into someone

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,610
else's shoes to really be able to

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,590
understand another person's point of

00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,600
view to the point where you can can

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,130
internalize it and almost viscerally

00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,110
feel it so if someone else is feeling

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,580
disappointment you too can have that

00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,560
same empathetic reaction in your body

00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,750
and in your mind and this differs from

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,299
sympathy which is when we have concern

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,340
for other person's problems but it

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:06,470
doesn't necessarily impact us directly

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,410
we want them to do better but it doesn't

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:12,230
necessarily take root in our own psyche

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,190
and therefore promote us to do different

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,180
actions or interact with them

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:20,739
differently so empathy is required for

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,630
absolutely everything that we do as

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:25,460
people and as technologists so

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,110
everything from what is the user

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,420
experience like when some

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,730
makes use of our software what is the

00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,530
developer experience like when someone

00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:37,220
takes our code and attempts to extend it

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:39,560
or build on top of it what is it that

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,419
actually creates an understanding of the

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,639
needs of others when we are creating

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:45,950
something and if we don't have the

00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,260
understanding of what other people are

00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:51,110
trying to gain from their interactions

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,790
with us or with our code we're not going

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,290
to meet their needs we're not going to

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,090
be able to pull them into our community

00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,470
as contributors we're not going to be

00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,360
able to effectively interface with them

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,669
because we aren't meeting them where

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,440
they are and making sure that what

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:05,870
they're provided is useful to them

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,460
people are happy to engage with other

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,410
people that they like but as Denise

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,540
pointed out in her keynote at the end of

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,250
the day it's about producing quality

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,720
technology that we can all make use of

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:22,520
wallstreet together as human beings and

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:26,000
of course it starts all with you so you

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:30,740
have to practice some kind of way to get

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,350
into empathy because empathy is not

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:39,229
necessarily a given so you're not born

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:41,390
empathetic well it differs but empathy

00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,250
is something that you can definitely

00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,430
learn it is a skill that you can learn

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:50,320
that you can practice and it's all about

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:54,800
you and knowing yourself how do I think

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:59,960
how do I react in certain situation how

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,120
do I feel about things might it be the

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,280
dog on the street do I like dogs

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,070
have I been bitten by a dog when I was a

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,700
child I'm afraid of dogs something like

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:18,340
this and also to express your feelings

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:21,770
and most of the time your inner feelings

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:24,140
guide your thoughts so if I have been

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:29,479
bitten by a dog when I was a child my

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:33,860
inner feelings tell me dog dangerous so

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:36,169
I will probably take a step back so that

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,270
is how I will react if you have not been

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:40,310
bitten by a dog if you only met nice

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,890
dogs who never barked at you and

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,310
were very friendly shaking their their

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:51,070
butt right you will probably say Oh

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:54,290
doggie hey can I pick you right and

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:58,480
there is it shows that there is a

00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:03,050
difference by your past experience and

00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:05,870
is also a difference by the audience

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,180
that surround you so it's probably

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:11,410
you're probably acting differently when

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,170
you're amongst your peers or your family

00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,850
or when you're on the board meeting or

00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:19,970
even when you're talking to a customer

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,340
we have several heads that we can put on

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,250
we have several roles that we work that

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:29,810
we that we play kind of but it's still

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:32,240
you and people who are empathetic tend

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:35,420
to be better negotiators because they

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,440
try to find a common ground some kind of

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,570
common ground for everyone could I just

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,910
add something oh yes please yeah so one

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,830
of the things that I think is incredibly

00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,270
important when talking to different

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,640
audiences with different experiences

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,860
again practicing empathy is really

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,200
driving home the point that empathy is

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,330
not just about with whom you are trying

00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,790
to communicate it really is about you

00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,250
there are some people who don't

00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:03,530
necessarily feel that kindness in

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,920
communication or what we refer to as

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,720
soft skills are really important really

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,100
and fundamentally to them it's all about

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,040
the code or the work product and the

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:16,100
path to get there is not it's not it's

00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,010
significant to them and you know I I can

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:22,130
understand that perspective but

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:24,620
fundamentally if you want to be able to

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,660
make that pie bigger if you want to be

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,360
able to have people come along with you

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,770
and work beside you and help you to

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,050
improve the things that you care about

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:36,830
you're not going to be able to do this

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,360
if you are not kind of cerned with their

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,830
needs as well like you can't just expect

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,050
people to show up and do it all your way

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,460
it won't be effective so if you're one

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,530
of those people who thinks those squishy

00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,390
human things are not necessarily for you

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,980
we really want to encourage you to think

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,960
about the use of empathy and your

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,720
interactions with others because it will

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,069
be of benefit to you as well and

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,449
you can get more of what you want so

00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:58,189
this is not just be nice to everybody

00:08:56,449 --> 00:09:04,699
it's also be nice to everybody so you're

00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:06,800
being nice to yourself yes so one thing

00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:09,170
that I think is very important is to

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,360
realize that empathy is actually a

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,939
choice it is a choice that we make every

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,670
day to be empathetic or not you know as

00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:18,410
Diana pointed out earlier diana is not

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,610
something that we are innately empathy

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,860
is not something we're innately born

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,110
with right it is a learned skill

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,879
and there have been several very

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,420
interesting studies done in the last

00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:32,089
couple of years about empathy and how it

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,589
can be cultivated in people and these

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:37,879
studies turned up two points that I'd

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:42,949
like to make one is that people when

00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:45,529
given a choice will not do things that

00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:47,839
they think will cause them to feel

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,970
empathy when they feel that will give

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,000
them a greater emotional or cognitive

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,129
burden so in this particular study they

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,569
were given a choice of how they wanted

00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:59,689
to arrive at a particular destination

00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:02,740
and one way was through a neighborhood

00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:04,759
where there was great poverty and where

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,579
the chances that you would observe that

00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,480
great poverty were higher and one

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:10,309
direction was through you know a

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,990
beautiful city center with museums and

00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:14,660
you know wonderful artistic things and

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,879
the the beautiful route was much longer

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,129
about five minutes longer most people

00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,959
chose to take the longer route and when

00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:22,459
asked about it it wasn't the beautiful

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,350
buildings or the opportunity to see the

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:27,110
museum it was just that they they felt

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,550
like seeing the poverty and the city

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,990
would would be harmful to them it would

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,379
make them sad so they simply avoided it

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:35,809
which means again empathy is a choice

00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:38,509
that we exercise so if we can choose to

00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:40,430
be empathetic and not just you know feel

00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:42,769
like well I'm not good at this so I just

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,600
won't you know worry about it then again

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:47,779
we all have the opportunity to improve

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,839
in this regard and the other key facet

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:54,139
of this study was the ability to prime

00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,389
people to feel empathy so the next stage

00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:57,620
of the research was for the research

00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,889
team to work with this group of

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,959
individuals and to tell them stories

00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:06,110
that Illustrated the exercising of

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,370
empathy everything from a stranger meets

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,620
someone who this

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,850
an old tale in so many cultures a

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,680
stranger meets someone who doesn't have

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,930
a coat and offers their coats to this

00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,450
stranger and creates a better world by

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,210
doing this and sharing too you know

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,470
other tales of people helping one

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,110
another and being kind to one another

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,120
and once this the research subjects had

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,740
heard these stories and then they were

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,810
given a test about what choices they

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,630
would make in a given situation they all

00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:34,520
scored much higher towards empathetic

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,950
reactions to other people because their

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,320
brains have been trained with the idea

00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,029
that empathy produces positive results

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,040
so if we know that this is something

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:45,920
that is you know a choice and can be

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,779
trained I guess what I'm trying to say

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,660
in a very long-winded way is nobody gets

00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:52,760
a free pass to be a jerk because they

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,830
think they can't be nice to other people

00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,779
like it's if it's your choice whether or

00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,210
not you want to be kind welcoming and

00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:00,950
gracious but don't tell me you can't do

00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,020
it I've heard people tell me they just

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,150
can't do it and to you I say you are

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:09,200
fibbing it's just not it's just not the

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:11,570
case and speaking of skill so it is not

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,680
any innate skill so you can learn it

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:17,990
nicely set and you can learn it for

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:23,089
example by being reflective what does

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:26,510
that mean well you basically their

00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:29,420
interactions with other humans and I

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:32,630
will give you a little example of how I

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:35,110
learned to be more empathetic I was not

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,610
born like this so I had to work on that

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,520
what I did was I took 30 minutes

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,470
sometimes just 15 minutes a day i sat

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,760
down at the end of the day I wrote down

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:49,190
the interactions that might be a bit

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,029
difficult for me and I wrote down what

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,390
did I say

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:55,250
and I reflected on what did I feel at

00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,310
that time and what did the other person

00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,860
say and what could I have said that this

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:03,860
interaction would not have been so

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:10,670
difficult for the both of us or for the

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:14,270
people around me so you have to first

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,040
learn yourself as I said and then try to

00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,290
communicate with others because we are

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,149
not we are not living in a vacuum we are

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,149
living with other human beings around us

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:26,329
and find some trusted human beings and

00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:30,439
try to learn in baby steps and talk to

00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:33,319
them about things like whoa what you

00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:35,930
what you just said hurt my feelings I

00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:39,639
can't really say why but let us discuss

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:42,769
about this or something like this an

00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,959
empathy is often built through adversity

00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:48,170
when you go through stress time you

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,620
Britt you really know who is empathetic

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,540
around you so just because things are

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,579
coming easy to you does not mean that

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,930
they that these things come easy to

00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:01,970
everyone and I can tell you words matter

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:05,749
so if you are for example coaching a

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:11,749
junior and you say words like you just

00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:14,990
have to it's obviously this and that you

00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:17,870
diminish their knowledge you you're not

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:22,430
really empowering them to do it yourself

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:24,649
themselves right and to give you another

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,759
example which I really really like so I

00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:29,149
have to tell it

00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:32,809
I saw a talk some years back by a blind

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:33,949
person obviously there it is I say it

00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:37,249
too I'm sorry

00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:39,379
so I am I am not I'm not blind

00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:41,929
I tell you I'm not blind I can see you I

00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:45,019
can see colors this person was blind and

00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:46,970
he couldn't see colors and it was back

00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,879
in the days when the first iPhone app

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:52,759
came out that can tell the colors of

00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,980
things so he was very excited over the

00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,519
day he got this app and he wanted to go

00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,259
home and try this up so he went home at

00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,179
the end of the day it was in the mid mid

00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:05,600
of winter he was living in Great Britain

00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:07,309
so it was duck any went home and he

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,829
tried this app he tried it on his shirt

00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:12,769
and it said black he tried it on his

00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:14,420
desk it said black he tried it on

00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:17,600
several other things and it said black

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,990
and he was like I can't be and then he

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,480
was thinking okay um colors colors

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,899
what's what's going on with colors oh I

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,110
need light otherwise it will not

00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:31,670
distinguish the colors right so he went

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,350
switched on the light and then he tried

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,680
his app again and

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:40,550
blue red orange yellow and he was like

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:44,290
oh I learned something today so he was

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,290
empathetic in the other way

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:51,200
so well that what I want to say about

00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:54,170
this is you have to step out of your

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,720
comfort zone and try to find out what

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,480
the other comfort zone is and what that

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:04,880
means is not only think about it but as

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:07,220
I said talk to people so another way to

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,780
to cultivate empathy within yourself is

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,790
to practice a skill called active

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,190
listening so active listening is a

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,110
concept that came out of the nonviolent

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,660
communications framework which was used

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:22,280
to in the Middle East peace process of

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:26,660
the 70s and the idea of active listening

00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:30,110
is to ensure that the people engaged in

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,000
your conversation know not only that you

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,330
have heard what they've said but that

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,420
you have internalized it and that what

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:41,240
they have said to you matters to you and

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,220
you can do this very simply we'll do a

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,580
quick demonstration Diana would you like

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,360
to have some dinner yeah I feel a bit

00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,440
like sushi

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,710
okay so sushi so I don't eat fish so do

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,360
you think they have teriyaki dishes yes

00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,740
I'm pretty sure they have teriyaki

00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,090
dishes okay

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,590
perfect and also usually the Haab

00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,200
tempura okay great so I'm hearing dinner

00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,850
let's find a sushi place is there one

00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,010
you prefer should we look it up online I

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,750
think we can look it up online I'm not

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,010
familiar with this great excellent okay

00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,830
so I'll go ahead and get out my phone

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,690
and there we go we have just had an

00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:17,540
active listening conversation I have

00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:19,730
demonstrated to Diana that I've heard

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,860
that she wants food I've heard that she

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,900
wants a particular type of food I've

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,430
brought my concerns to the table as well

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,900
saying I'm not someone who eats fish

00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:29,870
will there be something available for me

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,880
she said absolutely and then therefore

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,160
great we have dinner plans now so that's

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,290
a very simple example but the practice

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,690
of active listening is about mirroring

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,550
the communications that you're seeing

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,650
from the other parties and the dialogue

00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,930
so this can be everything from changing

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,670
your body language which we do more or

00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,800
less consciously that's called mirror

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,940
so if I'm talking to Diana and we're

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,240
both hanging out together we usually end

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:57,140
up like this it happens and also by

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,820
repeating back to the other person in

00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,960
our dialogue what they've said but in

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,880
our own words we've shown that we've

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,580
internalized it and that we were

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,880
actually listening how many people have

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:11,090
seen the movie Fight Club okay do you

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,920
remember that great scene where the the

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:17,840
main characters are at a support group

00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:20,420
and the girl says most people are just

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,550
waiting for their turn to talk not

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,570
really listening active listening is

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,190
about showing that you're not just

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,780
waiting for your turn to talk that the

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,140
other person in the dialogue matters to

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,900
you and you rephrase it

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,210
some somehow so it's your words and not

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,800
theirs because if you just repeat their

00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,650
words they would say yeah yeah you

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,870
understand me but sometimes you do not

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,670
and no one wants to talk to a robot

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,080
would you like to get would you like to

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,430
get dinner yes I would like to get

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,170
dinner like that's that's not what we're

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,970
talking about right like you know engage

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,080
in dialogue bring your whole self but

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,310
you know again make sure that you're

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,750
bringing your whole self to listen to

00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,970
what the other person has to say yeah

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,070
and there's there's another very very

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,670
important thing where you can actually

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:05,120
practice empathy without interacting

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,650
with other humans this is my favorite

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,330
way of practicing empathy mostly because

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,530
I was that little nerd child in the

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,640
corner with a book all the time not

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,130
talking to the other human beings

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,950
because human beings are scary so you

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:18,110
can cultivate empathy in yourself simply

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,340
through the act of reading fiction

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:24,560
fiction is an excellent opportunity to

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,570
understand people's motivations how the

00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,540
characters interact and it's different

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,040
from viewing a fictive work or you know

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,280
my favorite shows on Netflix or whatever

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:37,520
because my imagination is going to fill

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,830
out whatever detail the author of the

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,050
work has not included so I am able to

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,240
envision a character and perhaps it's

00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,950
clear to me that since this person is

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,480
very arrogant they always wear purple

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:51,110
because they think they're very special

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,730
like royalty or perhaps you know someone

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,280
who's very nervous drinks a lot of

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:58,010
coffee very quickly right being able to

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,320
have that mental image that accompanies

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,299
the story is actually a practice

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,299
of empathy because you are forced to

00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:06,740
understand these characters their

00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,690
motivations how they present themselves

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,820
in the world what exactly is it that

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,080
makes them tick and by going through

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,570
that process you can learn about how

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,980
other human beings do that because

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,649
unless you're reading specfic which you

00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,000
know has its place you know the great

00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:22,159
works of literature the world over are

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,259
about teaching us how people are

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,909
motivated why they do the things that

00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:27,169
they do and this is this is useful

00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:28,580
knowledge for us when we're out in the

00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,519
real world talking to real people and

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,309
not just turning page after page I have

00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,720
a great example for that can I have a

00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:38,600
show of hands if you know higher power

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,669
if you read Harry Potter all right there

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,470
was a discussion about I don't know one

00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:44,899
or two years ago about a movie of Harry

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:48,259
Potter where Hermione would be played by

00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:50,389
a colored girl and everyone was so

00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:53,659
enraged because they said how can that

00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:56,299
be no no no no and Joan Kjaer Rowling

00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:58,700
came up and said no no I never mentioned

00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:02,450
Hermione's skin I mentioned she had

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:05,840
curly hair she had big teeth all of the

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:09,409
things I never I never really mentioned

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,070
her skin so it was our imagination that

00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:14,690
had this Himani character put on the

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,450
Hermione character of the movies for

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,730
example so there were people out there

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,909
who were really really really really

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:26,169
scared I think of the prospect of being

00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:29,299
Hermione Granger with coloured skin so

00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:31,190
and not again that's the the power of

00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:32,899
our imagination and being able to place

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,909
ourself in that story and then think

00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:36,649
about this as well people are so afraid

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:37,879
and so threatened that the picture that

00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:41,059
they have built in their head of a

00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:43,039
particular fictitious will be disturbed

00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:46,700
that it causes public outcry which is

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,980
fascinating to me yes totally so what I

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,500
wanted to say with that is actually stay

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,210
curious you know as a kid we wanted to

00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,730
explore everything we wanted to know

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,919
what does this button do why do I don't

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,649
have to why do I have to keep away from

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,889
the sockets and stuff like this but as a

00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:06,110
grownup not so much but you should be

00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:09,190
curious about all the things especially

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:12,769
about the human beings around you and

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,650
because hopefully none of you is a mind

00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:15,510
reader

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,030
we are usually not a mind-reader we

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:21,600
can't say okay you're doing this because

00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:25,430
of that that and that is an assumption

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,140
and I can tell you assumptions are evil

00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,780
really I've been there I've done that I

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,930
have fallen into the well where I

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:37,590
assumed something and I was literally

00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:39,870
smacked on the head and said no I mean I

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:42,060
don't say don't assume anything because

00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,780
we are humans of course we assume things

00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,960
because that is how we built but ask

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:52,470
questions talk to the people

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:55,500
communication is the key by questions I

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:58,590
don't mean close questions where you can

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:02,130
only only answer with yes or no do you

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:05,730
like blue yes something like this no use

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,620
open question in German we only have W

00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,690
questions so that's pretty easy but in

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:13,170
English we also have H questions so we

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:15,570
have what why how for example what do

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:21,510
you think about that invite the people

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:24,210
to communicate with you so basically

00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:27,690
those open questions are your friends

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,800
and I I think it's also a critical thing

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,450
when we think about the exercise of

00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,720
empathy to realize that there are so

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,880
many times that we go into a situation

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,430
with people where we feel that there may

00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,100
be conflict and we have already decided

00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,600
how the other person feels clearly

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,740
so-and-so doesn't like me or they

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,810
wouldn't have made that post to the

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,130
mailing list obviously this person

00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:49,110
thinks I'm an idiot look at what they

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,580
said in my last code review you know

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,230
obviously we're not going to get along

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,970
because you know this person has

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,150
different thoughts about politics than I

00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,000
do

00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:00,960
and again those assumptions are evil we

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,730
have no idea how another person feels or

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,590
what their life experience is like if we

00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:07,400
don't ask them we can make some basic

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:09,810
assumptions like I see you are awake

00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,130
excellent probably you're ready to

00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,300
communicate since you're ready to you

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,530
know since you're awake and you have a

00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,960
coffee in your hand so you know good

00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,570
signals but we cannot just make

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,940
assumptions about how people feel think

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,550
or how they'll act because of our own

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,810
fear or any concerns we have on our part

00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,580
we need to set those fears aside in

00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,120
order to effectively again bring our

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,010
holes

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,660
to the dialogue and did you hear the

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:36,360
words obviously just right clearly yes I

00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,330
mean oh when you when you did the

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,240
negative example so that's that's

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,570
totally fine I too shall fail it will be

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,360
fine

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:52,290
no so uh again if you're going to create

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,650
an environment of empathy you need to be

00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,730
very explicit about your values and

00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,860
inclusive in those values and what I

00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:02,730
mean by inclusive in those values is you

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,290
need to make it very clear why everyone

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,929
is there together working on a common

00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,940
problem what are the goals that you're

00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:11,250
all trying to achieve and what are your

00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,809
non goals like what who are the people

00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,550
or the ideas that will not be well

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:16,590
served by interacting in this company

00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:20,850
organization open source project and

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:22,170
don't just assume that because you're

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,080
all friends working on something

00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:27,240
together that as time goes by and your

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,429
project matures that that will be enough

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,650
right this unwritten lore that we tend

00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:34,110
to rely upon in open source projects and

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,880
think that everyone will understand why

00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:38,250
decisions are made this way or how

00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,770
decisions get made or how to influence

00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,929
or persuade within the project it's it's

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,880
not something that everyone understands

00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:46,260
and then it can end up being

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,270
exclusionary if we don't make explicit

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,580
what our values are and what our

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,770
cultural history is because people don't

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,740
necessarily innately understand the in

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:58,080
jokes or the the lore of the group right

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,240
we need to make it very clear what those

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,800
stories are what the project values are

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,840
and why we want people to show up and

00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,600
interact with us and I think that this

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,809
is equally important for open source

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,640
projects as it is for companies so

00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:13,679
depending upon what your you know the

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,090
values of your company are beyond making

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,220
a profit you know you need to make those

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:19,800
explicit one of the companies that I

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,790
think is a great model and this as

00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,460
thought works anyone in the audience

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:26,640
from thought works ok well we wish you

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,830
the very best wherever you folks are so

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,800
on thought works website there is

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:34,590
actually a page discussing how the

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,570
company will work towards social justice

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,330
and the way that they are defining

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,740
social justice is to help to empower

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,809
groups of people who don't have as much

00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,659
access to technology with more

00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:49,120
technology by having their employees

00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:51,130
have as part of their paid work time the

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,230
ability to do community oriented events

00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,429
that are educational to everyone in the

00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,620
community whether or not they are

00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:59,159
somehow commercially affiliated with

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,720
thought works and they also dedicate

00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,700
developer time and resources to working

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,220
on projects that are of social benefits

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:09,909
such as open source health systems and

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,590
they not only make this value explicit

00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:13,419
within their company that they care

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,630
about making the world a better place on

00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:18,610
top of wanting to make a profit they put

00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:22,000
it on their externally facing website so

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:24,460
every single customer every single

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,980
person who pencha Li wants to have a

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,210
commercial engagement with them

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,799
understands that these are fundamental

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,149
values that thought work supports and

00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:33,549
that they will put their time energy and

00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:36,669
resources towards it and that are also

00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:38,279
that is an explicit invitation for you

00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:40,659
to engage with them if these values

00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,559
mirror your own right they've made it

00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,639
very clear what they're there for

00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,779
they're not just there to write code

00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:44,169
they're also there to make the world a

00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:49,029
better place

00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:50,639
according to these guidelines I didn't

00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:53,289
have anything else interesting to say

00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:57,389
okay good

00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:59,559
as a let's go there okay cool so

00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:00,880
discourage hippo egg I shall define

00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,519
hippo for those in the audience not

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,610
familiar with the term the idea of hippo

00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:09,070
Aang is that the highest paid person's

00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,750
opinion is the only one that matters so

00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,399
it's not this delightful creature that

00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,860
you see before you it's actually not a

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,990
cool thing so it's not the manager that

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,450
stands in front of you and says you and

00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:23,049
tells you what to do and what not to do

00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:26,139
it is actually if you are the hippo in

00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:30,490
the room please make sure that every

00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:35,950
walk every voice is heard so that people

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:38,590
have a voice as a hippo I can tell you

00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:42,880
it is energy draining it is a lot of

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:44,559
work it is a lot of mind work that goes

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,830
into that so when you're in a meeting

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,929
with 10 people and you have to take care

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,020
of all of those 10 people you have an

00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,700
agenda and

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,370
everyone wants to say something so

00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,680
everyone should have the opportunity to

00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:02,720
say something we all know those people

00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:06,230
who are very laid-back and who do not

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,860
speak their mind very often so if you

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:12,980
are the manager the hippo on in this man

00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:16,340
in this meeting make sure to have an eye

00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,440
contact with everyone and ask them if

00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,180
they want to do this so I have I have

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,650
this friend I have to I have to tell you

00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,560
this I'm working with him on volunteer

00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:30,350
projects for quite some time and when we

00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:32,420
are in the meeting he does this all

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:35,000
those nervous nervous things and you

00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:38,420
know he's warming up to say something

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,970
and then some somebody else needs to do

00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:43,640
and needs to take the role and say hey I

00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,960
can see you you have something to say it

00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,200
looks like you have something to say

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,880
what do you want to say and then finally

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,250
he comes out with all the things that he

00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,590
wanted to say but he did not speak over

00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:58,910
over the others because that's that's

00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:03,350
not how he is and also make pauses for

00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:06,980
people to think silence is actually good

00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:08,690
if you are talking all the time over and

00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,220
over again there are people that who

00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:14,150
cannot follow the the whole

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:17,240
communication stay quiet for a moment

00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:20,420
also in a conf call silence is good

00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:24,500
people have to think make sure that

00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:26,440
people have the opportunity to think and

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,310
the other thing that I think is very

00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,820
important as a takeaway from this

00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:33,620
principle is that good leaders tend to

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,590
think that all they need to do is say

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,330
everyone's opinion is welcome and we

00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:41,360
want everyone to share their ideas and

00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:44,710
we have an open-door policy and while

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,540
they may actually mean those things and

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:49,970
those things are true for them most

00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,740
people have been socialized to their

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,540
past experience that when you hear those

00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:57,140
words they are empty words and that they

00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:59,090
are not actually true so I don't I've

00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,740
been in many jobs where I was told there

00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,390
was an open-door policy and typically

00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,680
when I went through the open door I left

00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,480
thinking that the door was gonna hit me

00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,029
in the behind on the way out

00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,519
not a very positive experience so over

00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:13,269
time I've learned to be much more

00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,799
careful in what I say and how I

00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:17,450
articulate my ideas in in group settings

00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,649
until I've gotten to know everyone

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,110
really well and understand that it

00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:23,750
really is an environment of

00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:25,759
psychological safety so if you're in a

00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,950
leadership position in a project at a

00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,169
company if you're a highly paid CEO if

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,429
you are you know the lead maintainer on

00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:33,639
a project don't just say to everybody

00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:36,440
you know I want to know what you think

00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:38,509
because these people probably off we

00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,710
hope like you they don't want to tell

00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:42,440
you something they think will disappoint

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,580
you you need to open the dialogue by for

00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,980
example pointing out something that you

00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,379
don't like or making it very clear that

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:50,210
you yourself have made mistakes in order

00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:51,950
for people to feel again an environment

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,289
of psychological safety so that they can

00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,970
challenge that highest person's opinion

00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:57,320
highest paid person's opinion or the

00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:01,250
person with the highest status in the

00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:04,129
room so don't flip the bows a bit um

00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,120
anybody heard the term bows a bit okay

00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:07,220
cool there are a few people in the

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,740
audience so the term bows a bit was

00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,210
brought to us in 1995 by a gentleman

00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,250
named Jim McCarthy and his book the

00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,080
dynamics of software development which

00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:18,559
is still an excellent book to read even

00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:21,889
if it has gotten as old as I am actually

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,309
I'm older let's not tell anyone so the

00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:26,720
idea of the bows obit is that somebody

00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:30,230
within your team or organization has

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,059
done something so silly and egregious

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,279
that you've flipped the bozo a bit like

00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:36,740
no matter what you think this person is

00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:38,389
a clown nothing they say is valuable you

00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,889
just kind of you know you ignore them

00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,690
and all that you say it and do you work

00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:44,840
around them rather than trying to work

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:47,330
with them and the unfortunate thing

00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,490
about us as human beings flipping the

00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,889
bozo a bit is it is it is harmful to us

00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:54,019
and it is harmful to the person upon

00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:55,639
whom the bit has been flipped now I'm

00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,529
not saying there are not situations in

00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:59,779
which a moment makes you realise that

00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:01,039
perhaps this is not the place for this

00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:02,360
person to collaborate with you and your

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,580
team that's fine that's a different

00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,230
conversation to have but if you're in an

00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,210
environment where you have someone

00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,519
working with you and you actively route

00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,960
around them constantly you're wasting

00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,159
your time you're wasting their time

00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,990
you're creating an extremely

00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,230
uncomfortable situation for everyone

00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,860
who's observing this behavior and

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,990
fundamentally you've created

00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,280
a situation in which this person who's

00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,640
had the bit flipped on them can't

00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:28,660
succeed people are smart enough to know

00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:31,670
when someone has lost faith in them and

00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,679
typically if a person has made a mistake

00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,390
and it's a very big mistake shame will

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,870
cause them to continue making more

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:41,750
mistakes because they're afraid because

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:43,130
they are quite certain that their next

00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,540
step will be a mistake and typically

00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,950
they're right right and security begins

00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,770
to take over in our mind and cause us to

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,570
make poor decisions and it's equal and

00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,400
again it's also harmful for the person

00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,870
who's doing the bit flipping because

00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,169
you're cutting yourself off from the

00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,549
opportunity to learn from this person

00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,750
and even if it's just learning how to

00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:02,330
work with someone you find to be

00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:06,100
difficult right you have cut yourself

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:08,000
off from the opportunity to engage

00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,790
deeply with something that is

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,340
uncomfortable for you right everyone has

00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,510
a bad day everyone makes mistakes

00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,950
deciding that forever and always this

00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,169
person is not someone with whom you're

00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:21,500
going to spend your time or your

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:22,700
goodwill just is is harmful to everyone

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,040
around if you need to have a discussion

00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,840
about people parting ways then have that

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,119
discussion but don't don't sit in

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,590
collaborative spaces with people feeling

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,730
that you know you just really wish you

00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,260
weren't there because it's obvious to

00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:35,210
them it's obvious to other people and it

00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,950
just generally creates a really poor

00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:40,909
environment and again it lacks empathy

00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:44,300
and then we come to the next point make

00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:49,220
it truly okay to fail as I said earlier

00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:52,190
we are humans we are flawed seriously so

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:54,760
we make mistakes and sometimes we make

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,680
really really really really big mistakes

00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,830
because we we push software into the

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,050
market that is not ready yet and a lot

00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:06,290
of customers have a really really bad

00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:10,580
day for example it does not help to flip

00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:14,810
the bozo as Lesley said right so try to

00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:16,490
build a structure of tender tender is a

00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:18,680
new word that I learned just recently

00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:22,970
and which I like very very very much

00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,680
because it means be open be have

00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,140
constructive feedback have a

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:32,050
communication culture to talk about this

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:35,170
and also do retrospectives

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:37,810
set of post-mortems yes a lot of

00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:43,540
customers had a really really really bad

00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:45,580
day but nobody probably died so let's

00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,100
think about what went wrong we have a

00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:51,040
process this and this and this happened

00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:55,270
why do that why did we have this outcome

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,240
and then let's work from there I have a

00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:01,690
little exercise that I do with my team

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,060
every end of every project we do a

00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,980
retrospective of course and then at the

00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:09,370
end of the Brett respective we do the

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:12,070
appreciation game everyone says

00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:15,400
something positive about someone else

00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:17,350
and again as the hippo in the room I

00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,150
have to make sure that everyone had the

00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:21,910
chance to say something positive and

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:26,800
that everyone did receive something

00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:28,060
positive why do I do that to get my team

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,330
closer together

00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:34,540
to not only focus on all the negative

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:37,170
things that went wrong but also to see

00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:40,720
what we as accomplished as a team

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:46,030
because everyone knows that one negative

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:49,450
thing stands out so much against a lot

00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:52,630
of positive things and it helps my team

00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:56,020
to bond and it helps everyone to stay

00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:58,330
motivated to just say yes we can do that

00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:03,190
the next project will be even more

00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:04,870
awesome and again I introduced the term

00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,420
earlier in the talk psychological safety

00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,950
but just to put a little bit of context

00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,830
around that so once upon a time I worked

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,360
at Google and I had the opportunity to

00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,480
observe firsthand their hiring process

00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:19,480
which could be called rigorous kindly

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,030
and you know there was there was a lot

00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,200
of kerfuffle within the organization

00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:26,790
because what they really wanted to do

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,690
was understand what it was - that made

00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,520
particular engineers at their

00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,570
organization extremely successful

00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,250
because they wanted to make sure they

00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:38,170
were hiring the right people so they

00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:39,400
were hoping to find common patterns so

00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,230
that they could you know always just

00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,970
make the right choice of who to hire you

00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,560
know so again data-driven company they

00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,990
sifted through data and you know trying

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,600
to understand was it a particular unit

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,070
versity was at a particular programming

00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,090
language that you first learned was at

00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,250
the age at which you got your first

00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:55,140
computer and you know was it was it the

00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,940
impact of your manager and how your

00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,369
manager treated you like what is it that

00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:03,530
that created a success for an engineer

00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:06,420
at Google and people were very surprised

00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:09,180
to come back and report that what the

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,640
data bore out was not that it was a

00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,260
particular background it wasn't going to

00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,290
an elite university it wasn't because

00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,260
your manager was very experienced it was

00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:22,320
that the team that you are on was one in

00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:25,130
which it was truly ok to fail there was

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,200
an environment of psychological safety

00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,760
because people knew that if they said

00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,250
something silly or they made a mistake

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,960
they weren't going to have the bozo bit

00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,640
flipped on them they knew they could

00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,080
make mistakes and because they knew they

00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,330
could make mistakes they were much more

00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,810
willing to share ideas that they had

00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:45,840
that seemed impossible or outlandish or

00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:48,300
poorly formed but had the seed of

00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:51,420
something great within it and that was

00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,400
the number one determining factor for an

00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,140
engineer success was the environment

00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,030
that they were in was one in which it

00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,740
was ok to fail and it wasn't just words

00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:01,230
oh everyone makes mistakes it was

00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:03,119
repeatedly demonstrated by the team's

00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:05,490
leadership and by their peers that

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,030
mistakes were not costly mistakes were

00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:14,430
just simply a part of showing up yes and

00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:15,930
just to summarize our talk so we call

00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,490
this the we'll tell you what we'll tell

00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,830
you that we tell you then we'll tell you

00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:22,050
what we told you so again empathy is a

00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,940
choice and alert able skill and we can

00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:26,660
cultivate it through the processes of

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,710
active listening through reading fiction

00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:31,619
taking the time to get to know yourself

00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:34,410
and to deepen your self-awareness and to

00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,940
practice curiosity in your daily life

00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:39,540
and to avoid assumptions because they

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:44,520
are evil and I like to conclude this

00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:48,570
talk with a quote by Ian McLaren be kind

00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:52,020
for everyone you meet is fighting a hard

00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:59,300
battle thank you

00:39:52,020 --> 00:40:03,119
[Applause]

00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,589
thank you very much Leslie and Diana yes

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,240
can we have one second

00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:08,400
just a second so we're going to exercise

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,480
empathy now on stage which is a hard

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,660
thing to do what we're going to do it

00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:16,380
together I am German I am not from the

00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:19,500
US so I would like to apologize to the

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:22,380
people of color I just learned that

00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,839
colored people is a very offensive word

00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,089
I did not know that I am very sorry and

00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,920
I am very proud of you for taking the

00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:30,150
opportunity to apologize on stage

00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,440
because I know how frightening that is

00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:40,830
and this is one of the reasons why I

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:48,810
love you so much why she's my any

00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:51,150
questions folks thank you for the great

00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:53,520
talk so many things I want to ask but

00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,010
I'm gonna stick to one because I'm sure

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,930
a lot of people in this room are or had

00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:01,140
know someone who is in my wife for

00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:03,450
example is in a company that not doing

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:06,390
so many of these things and I see how

00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:08,400
much it frustrates her so for those

00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:12,089
people who are in companies where they

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,500
are not the hippo and they see so many

00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:16,380
problems they want to solve but don't

00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,480
have the power to do so how do you

00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,869
recommend that they try and effect those

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,950
changes that's an excellent question do

00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:30,089
you want to take that or shall I upon

00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:34,410
Tiffa Kate find an ally find as many

00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:37,140
allies as you can hopefully also one of

00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:40,880
the allies is a level higher than you

00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:44,220
and then try to change within it is

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,589
really hard work it's really hard work

00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,960
to find allies and it's really hard work

00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:52,200
to change an organization from within if

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:56,160
if there are only handful people but it

00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:59,580
is doable but it takes time because as

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,859
humans we tend to stick to the post that

00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,670
we have we tend to stick to the

00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:07,700
processes that we have so we need

00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:11,000
to be grabbed and shown that it is good

00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:13,309
to do things I'm absolutely in agreement

00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,619
about the finding of an ally the other

00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:17,390
thing that I would so there's there's a

00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:19,760
couple of different ways to think about

00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:21,200
this one is if you're looking around

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,390
within the organization and trying to

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,849
find allies and you don't find those

00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:27,230
allies it may very well be that this is

00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:28,880
not a good match for you in your

00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,470
personal value system and it's it's okay

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,410
to walk away from situations like that

00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:34,579
you don't have to fix it so it's just I

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,329
know that there are a lot of people who

00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:37,039
want to make the world a better place

00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:38,750
myself included and I have spent many

00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,789
cycles of my life trying to fix things

00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,230
that really just didn't need to be fixed

00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:46,339
I just needed to not be there watching

00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:48,890
it happen so that's always okay the

00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:50,990
other thing to think about is you know

00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:53,539
most businesses are supportive of their

00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,710
employees setting up informal affinity

00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:57,260
groups like communities of practice

00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:59,440
within their organization and you know

00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:02,240
having an informal group of folks who

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,559
you know hang out in the office over

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,359
lunch once a month and talk about like

00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:07,730
how can we all be better together and

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,799
you know identifying common problems

00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,690
that's great that's an excellent first

00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:12,980
step is particularly if it's not you

00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,329
know about being like critical to the

00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,369
business or critical to an individual

00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:19,069
just like you know we've noticed that

00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:20,480
employee retention is low we have high

00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:22,220
turnover maybe we should think about

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,039
what the root causes are for that and

00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:27,289
then finally if you're having issues

00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:31,039
with your management layer you know if

00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:33,170
you are brave and really you know feel

00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:35,779
like you want to fix it come with this

00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:39,289
list of common problems and the business

00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:40,940
drivers for change so you know if people

00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:42,440
are really unhappy because there isn't

00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,359
an environment of psychological safety

00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,980
talking about how a more inclusive

00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:47,480
dialogue in the workplace will help to

00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,759
increase retention because of any number

00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,950
of studies I'd be happy to sender wise

00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:53,509
and this is going to save us money

00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:56,089
because we don't have to keep doing

00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:57,619
retraining that can sometimes spark the

00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:59,839
positive change that any number of

00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:01,339
seemingly logical conversations about

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:05,569
why can't we just be kind to each other

00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:07,940
don't necessarily spark in folks there

00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:08,509
wait no no no there's a beta yeah yeah I

00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,920
know

00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:12,559
I know but there's the question in the

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,049
middle ok well then then the baby the

00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:17,160
momma I think I can't see the back that

00:44:15,049 --> 00:44:20,760
far maybe it's the daddy it's the mom

00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,440
ok good alright ok thank you very much

00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,930
for your talk it's awesome and we need

00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,309
more of talks like this so my question

00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,809
is actually a little bit similar to the

00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:31,740
previous but it's from a different angle

00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:34,380
so I think it's worth asking I think

00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:37,170
that you kind of pitch in to the choir

00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,930
here and people in this room really care

00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:42,059
about empathy but I have an impression

00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:45,420
that it's an assumption I'm making sorry

00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:48,900
that many developers are kind of like

00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,819
empathy deniers I know because I was on

00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,500
empathy dinner once and I thought that

00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:54,930
all the squishy bits don't matter and

00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:59,250
it's just like we just talk logically

00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:02,250
and it's gonna be great so my question

00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:05,010
is in your experience how do you talk

00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:08,010
about empathy to empathy deniers like

00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:09,660
what works to get people to see that

00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:14,369
there is something there actually that

00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:16,349
they should care about alright so this

00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:18,119
goes back to our early slide about this

00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:19,740
is about you - right so this is about

00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,089
encouraging folks to think about the

00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,510
problem in terms of enlightened

00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:26,700
self-interest okay so maybe I am

00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,799
convinced that as a you know as a senior

00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,329
developer that I am you know completely

00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:31,380
logical and rational and of course you

00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:33,599
know I don't have to worry about that

00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,069
squishy human stuff that's fine but if

00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,920
you can show to these people that a

00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:40,109
failure to have consideration for the

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,819
perspective perspective of others is

00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:42,750
harming their work that can often be

00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:47,130
very persuasive

00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:49,500
so okay so your error messages are non

00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,609
descriptive how many more bug reports

00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,140
are you getting because your error

00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:53,520
messages are non descriptive and they

00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,049
make total sense to you and of course

00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,440
it's completely logical that you'll say

00:45:55,049 --> 00:46:00,660
like code error 517 thousand twenty four

00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,920
so that does not compile like which

00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,020
means absolutely nothing to anyone but

00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,990
you right like you could have a smaller

00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,819
issue Q if you just wrote more human

00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,990
readable error messages for example and

00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:12,240
that's it's not necessarily a great

00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:14,460
example but again what is the impact to

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,619
that individual for failing to exercise

00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:20,369
empathy and once people start going like

00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:22,680
oh you mean I can make my pie bigger my

00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:24,510
issue Q smaller and like have a better

00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,809
day then you know people who tend to be

00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:30,210
kind of you know empathy deniers you

00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:31,109
know get on the train and you know come

00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:33,269
along with us and I'm act

00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:34,680
I would like to reverse and ask you how

00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:36,779
did you go from being an empathy denier

00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,269
to to being here with all of us today

00:46:36,779 --> 00:46:42,170
and we are we welcome you to our pot of

00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:42,170
people who care about empathy

00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,860
okay so I'm just gonna summarize that

00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:14,740
really quickly for the but the benefit

00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,940
of the the camera not having a the

00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,820
ability to hear you as well so

00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:20,470
apparently the rationality movement when

00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,730
folks got together and started thinking

00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,830
through things logically they discovered

00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,240
that if they were more focused on the

00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:27,610
human problems they were actually going

00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,960
to have better success in solving things

00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,870
that they thought were logically based

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,900
is that a fair summary we'll take it

00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:37,810
okay okay so let's be being empathic for

00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:41,080
the next speaker last question short

00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:43,080
answer yes so actually my question ties

00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:46,000
in very well with the last question

00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,880
which is just what set you on the path

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,880
to now think and advocate for empathy

00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:57,940
Wow oh that question okay I can answer

00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,590
this question um I can tell you that

00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,020
people who come from a difficult

00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:05,110
background like a really difficult

00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:08,290
background tend to care more about

00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:10,330
humans but of but because they come from

00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:13,840
a difficult background they did not

00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:17,710
learn to take care of other people they

00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:22,810
did not learn how to initiate empathy

00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:25,900
and so my path was I would like to help

00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:27,700
people I have no idea how because I did

00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,340
not learn it when I was young because of

00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:33,070
my difficult background so that was my

00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:37,570
my train that got me into into the role

00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:40,540
and also um bad role models so as I said

00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:42,940
toxic environment toxic managers and I

00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,160
have one manager that I always pull up

00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:48,760
in my mind and say okay I will do

00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:51,130
exactly the opposite I would like to

00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,510
just say that I learned reductively as

00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:55,420
well that empathy is a very positive

00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:57,670
thing to have and I lacked it in my

00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,980
youth I wanted to make sure that I

00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,530
didn't create an environment where I

00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:05,410
felt when I myself was there felt like I

00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:07,180
had no power and no agency because it

00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,350
felt very bad to me and I didn't ever

00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,670
want anyone else to be in that position

00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,900
so if there was a way that I could help

00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,000
them not be there and I was gonna do it

00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,780
yes

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,970
thank you very much thank you

00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,210
