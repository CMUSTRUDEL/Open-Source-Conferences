Title: #FOSSBack 18: Andrea Frittoli â€“ OpenStack and the "Four Opens"
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/openstack-and-four-opens

The OpenStack community prides itself on its "Four Opens": open source, open design, open development and open community. Each of the four opens has an impact on the choices made by the community and helps to shape the guiding principles and the shared culture of the community as well as its technical governance model.

In this short talk, I will present how the OpenStack community implemented its four opens; I will detail the implications in terms of governance, infrastructure, development processes and communication tools, and how similar approaches could be easily used by other communities.

	00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:10,389
hello everyone thanks for being so brave

00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,930
to be here in the last presentation of

00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:16,570
the day I think it was pretty intense

00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,330
day so you know thanks for being here so

00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:24,730
my name is Andrea Fratelli I in

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:27,640
developer advocate at IBM and in the

00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:31,119
past few years I've worked a lot with

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,610
the OpenStack community and so I'm here

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:42,790
today to talk about the OpenStack way

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:45,820
and the for opens so just one short step

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:49,360
back a bit of history so OpenStack was

00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,000
born in 2010 a joint effort from

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:57,070
Rackspace and NASA they created

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,559
OpenStack and then the project got some

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,230
momentum so I started growing and in

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:06,369
2011 two years later the OpenStack

00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:10,090
foundation was born for the number of

00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:13,090
reasons the per second foundation was

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,939
meant to help manage the financial

00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:19,420
aspect and the mission officially

00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:21,429
anyways is to promote OpenStack projects

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,029
and to give them like shared

00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:29,549
infrastructures and to links and to to

00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:32,469
be able to thrive the community kept

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,959
gaining momentum and growing so in the

00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:36,609
graph I have below that's I don't know

00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,560
if it's visible but it's basically the

00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:42,429
total number of commits in the different

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,770
OpenStack projects over the years so I

00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:48,130
didn't put exact numbers because these

00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,990
are taken from statics which is a place

00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,810
where gather statistics but they're not

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:58,479
official numbers so but the top bar in

00:01:52,810 --> 00:02:00,909
2016 16 is 85,000 commits so you can see

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,989
how it was growing and there's a lot of

00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:08,890
momentum and in 2014 there was a

00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:12,790
governance change so we used to have an

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:14,880
incubator model where project would not

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,020
be called as official OpenStack project

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,620
unless they met

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:23,800
a number of criteria and there was a lot

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,600
of pressure for produce to become

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,040
OpenStack project official post our

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,930
projects but there was a problem with

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,290
that like a vicious circle because a lot

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:38,320
of employees employers they did want

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,410
their employees only to work on official

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,740
OpenStack projects and so it was

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:47,050
difficult to gain the needed diversity

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,600
in the project and the needed momentum

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,100
for them to actually become meet all the

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,110
requirements to become official

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,110
OpenStack project oops sorry about that

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,890
so I'm not supposed to say the big tent

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,210
because that's not the official name

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,240
anymore but there it is

00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:10,960
so the community decided to change the

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,090
governance and to make a project the

00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,280
requirement to be an openstack project

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,100
to lower the bar to make it simpler so

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,160
and then to use a tag system so that we

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,260
can basically tag different project

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,209
based on their capabilities of the

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,100
maturity level so that then users can

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,050
decide which project they want to

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,940
contribute to or they wanted to use in

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,880
their production environments based on

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,580
their maturity level so one of the

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,220
things still project have to comply with

00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:43,350
out to be OpenStack project is to follow

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:46,660
the OpenStack way which is summer

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:53,440
summary in this for opens open source

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:55,770
design development and community so open

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,410
source should be pretty straightforward

00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,630
so the code is available it's available

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:06,580
on github in stag lot or get its mirror

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:09,580
to github if you're starting a project

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:13,090
it's easy to put it on github or github

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,220
or any of these free services however if

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,870
you're considering joining a foundation

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,299
or if you have the resources to do so

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,850
it's probably a good idea to host your

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:24,090
code in some infrastructure that you

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:28,000
maintain so you don't have any

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,440
dependency to company that holds your

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,090
code that you don't have any control on

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,620
I mean

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,210
you seen the recent news I mean I think

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,180
with github we have been lucky enough to

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:40,300
I think with Microsoft seriously I think

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:44,889
it's going to be to go well but you

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:48,940
never know what's going to happen so and

00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:52,090
the other thing is the Apache License

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:58,630
we have Apache to the old license by

00:04:52,090 --> 00:05:02,290
default for OpenStack and yeah so and we

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:07,720
also have a CLA so we both both have the

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:11,530
individual CLA the corporate CLA this is

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,600
something I would say it's it's very

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:17,080
convenient to have for a project it's a

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,450
nice protection to have because it can

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,729
be a bit complicated to figure out where

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,860
having the license alone it's enough it

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:25,630
depends on the country where you get

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,250
your contribution from so in some

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,440
countries the fact that you submit a

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,550
contribution to a project where you have

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,850
a license it's enough in other countries

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:39,760
it might not be enough so in that sense

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:45,280
having a CLA is a protection for the

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:47,590
project owner and but it's also kind of

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,510
in a bit contribution in some cases so

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,349
we seen in OpenStack a lot of

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:55,690
contributors they want to start joining

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:58,180
or getting near to the to the community

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,020
and they want to submit the first patch

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,840
and then they they hit the the wall with

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,840
the signing of the the contributing

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,740
license agreement so the CLA so that can

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,870
scare people off so you might want to

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,979
investigate whether you need one or you

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,000
there are alternatives like the

00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:23,889
contributor certificate of origin that

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,729
you can use instead of a CLA never most

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:30,220
demo contributor friendly another thing

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:35,530
which might be less less obvious about

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:39,870
open source is the no open core so it's

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:42,490
part of the mission of OpenStack to

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,650
provide software which is not crippled

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,710
in any way functional or

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:50,500
from a performance point of view also

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:53,350
because OpenStack is a club management

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,560
platform so it basically drives other

00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:00,790
software so we get storage networking

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:04,600
compute and other things and we don't

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:07,320
accept a project part of OpenStack as

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,729
long as there is no open source

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,250
alternative to actually run it in

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:16,960
production so let's say you write a

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:18,940
project that drives a certain

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,610
functionality in your cloud if the only

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:24,100
implementation available are only

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:26,229
existing implementation available for

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,690
the drivers are closed source you you

00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,880
basically cannot use you cannot have a

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,400
fully open source implementation of your

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,979
service so you need to have some closed

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,680
source component in there

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:41,560
so that's requirement that we we have

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,270
that them there must be at least one

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,970
open source fully functional

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:55,870
implementation of direct dependencies of

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:57,789
OpenStack so is that enough to be open

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,840
does it really means being open source

00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:03,460
like sharing the code well one of the

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,970
things that I look at if I'm starting to

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,800
use a library or project Starling

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,370
investigating whether I might use it in

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,889
my code is what what's the roadmap what

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,199
may I expect for this project to happen

00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:19,389
is it maintained or people contributing

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,419
to it what what's coming next and so

00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:26,889
forth so what the way we addressed is in

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:30,639
OpenStack we do specifications as code

00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:32,979
so every project defines what they're

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,360
going to be working on or they make

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,529
proposals about what they're going to be

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,089
working on and they propose those as

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:43,410
patches and then there is discussion

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:46,420
happening and then we have a clear

00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:48,970
release cadence and at the beginning of

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,339
the release or before the release

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,860
started there is a selection of what are

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:56,620
the proposed features that are going to

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,329
be worked on during the release cycle so

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,220
that basically before

00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:03,040
a few months in advance we have a good

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,449
view of what may be coming at Daniel at

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,369
the end of the release of course

00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:07,660
specification are not guarantee that

00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:08,679
things are going to be actually

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,129
implemented but they are a good

00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,899
indication also one thing interesting

00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:17,769
that we have is their release note

00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:19,929
automation and this is this kind of

00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,699
tooling is implemented under the

00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:24,699
OpenStack a namespace but it's not

00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:27,040
OpenStack specific really so you can

00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:30,249
reuse it and in your project if you

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,410
think it's useful so the release notes

00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:34,179
we realized that if we postponed

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,819
creating release notes at the end of the

00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:38,559
release cycle the most cases that would

00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:40,239
be incomplete or people who not left

00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,819
cycles to work on them it was really

00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:44,439
hard getting difficult to maintain them

00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:45,939
and it was getting a stronger and

00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:48,730
stronger requirement from users and

00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:51,189
operators to have good release notes so

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,869
we introduced the mechanism by which

00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:55,239
we'd ever commit if the commit is

00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:58,509
changing anything like it's touching an

00:09:55,239 --> 00:10:01,989
API or modifying your database schema or

00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:03,939
is doing any changes which is relevant

00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:06,850
from an upgrade point of view for

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:09,730
instance or operation point of view then

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,549
a piece of release must be included

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,319
within the commit so that and then there

00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:17,139
is a mechanism for automatically

00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:22,089
generating the release notes along with

00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:26,529
the release we also do okay we have

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:28,299
project update sessions that we do at

00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,279
our summits their videos they are

00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:32,290
recorded and then they are available so

00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:33,189
you can check it and look at them to

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,639
know what's coming

00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:39,699
basically the second thing I look at if

00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,100
I'm going to use a project is probably

00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:44,559
well if I want to influence its

00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,169
direction can I do it if I can I have

00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,809
some influence can I propose some

00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:57,759
changes if there are things that I need

00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:59,619
extra can I add them so the way we

00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,899
addressed is in in OpenStack is with

00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:03,790
contributors for contributor focus

00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:07,749
advance so we have what we call the ptg

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,579
the contributors technical contributors

00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:10,660
gathering that we do every six months

00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:13,870
where

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,730
mostly developers but also users and

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,030
operators they meet and they plan for

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,770
the development for the next six months

00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,900
we have what we call the forum which so

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:25,570
we have OpenStack summits which are like

00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,790
vendor centric event but along with the

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,040
summits we have what we call the forum

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,960
which is again technical sessions

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,570
between developers and users and

00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,060
operators to collect the feedback on how

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,100
the the software is used and what are

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,830
their features which are needed mostly

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:47,290
most needed for the future and also we

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:49,420
do meetings or office hours in IRC and

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,540
everything all the communication in IRC

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,550
is recorded and we store the locks of

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,680
the communication and they are hosted by

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,380
us so you can go and look them up you

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,820
can reference to any conversation to

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,590
bring another conversation you can just

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,970
point a link and say ok this is what we

00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,360
discussed here and there and it's

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,860
everything is transparent this way so

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,990
this is just a picture from a design

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,000
session and you can see we tried not to

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,720
use microphone where possible everyone

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,100
sits together there's not there is one

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,620
moderator but there is no real nor

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,450
really a presenter so everyone talks to

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,020
each other we use a tool called heater

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,850
pad to have like collaboration and

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,730
everyone can write on the same time and

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,260
we take notes collaboratively and those

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:37,210
so this is available for people that

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:40,660
cannot be physically in the room and one

00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:42,430
of the downsides of open design scope

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,470
creep when you have a lot of people

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,870
proposing what they want to what is

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,030
their use case for your for the software

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,690
for the community to work on you might

00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:55,480
end up doing a lot of things and maybe

00:12:51,690 --> 00:13:02,440
each of them a bit slower or less

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:04,540
integrated or but over time it converges

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,020
I think when we see which a certain

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,460
maturity then the requirements coming

00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,620
from people that is actually running

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,850
your software in production becomes

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,880
stronger so if you have a good

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:21,910
communication with your users you can

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:24,550
overcome this issue so the next open

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:29,620
development we use

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:31,570
Garet for review code review so what I

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,370
mean with God but we mean with code

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,890
development is that everything related

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,230
to the development workflow development

00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:41,260
experience should be open so reviews are

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,930
open one thing that is important there

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:51,100
is like with everything open you have to

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:52,660
be careful and aware that is not Garrett

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,430
you're talking to but it's people you're

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,350
talking to on the other side so I think

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,980
there were a lot of nice talks about

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,650
these today so you have to be mindful

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,450
that the comments you're putting there

00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:09,250
they're going to people and you have to

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:10,960
be to try to be positive like nitpicking

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,750
on things that are not worth to the

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,880
mascara of contribute contributions not

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,910
everyone is not even the lingual in the

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,250
language you're writing into so they may

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,910
be misunderstanding so we must be

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,670
careful in that open development means

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:31,930
that everything we do around development

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,880
so CI and QA is open including like the

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,490
configuration management part of it so

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,200
we run services for CI we run them

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,240
ourselves but even the configuration

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,500
management part of it is open and open

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,900
source and it's part of the community

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,360
which means that actually we have a lot

00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,870
quite a few companies that took our CI

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,190
system and started running it downstream

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,630
for their own internal CIS and

00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:58,360
contributing back and helping us

00:14:52,630 --> 00:15:01,750
maintaining it so we keep development in

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,440
CI aligned we use the same tool and this

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:07,980
is important because you want to provide

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:12,490
developers three of your community a

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,530
system a development experience which is

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,790
actually always working so if someone

00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,470
wants to contribute something to your

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,640
project and they start they try to use

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,350
the development tools and they're not

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,300
working they're not likely to actually

00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,490
be very happy continuing working in the

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,860
community but because we use the same

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,260
tools in CI we make sure they're always

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,390
working and we are so careful about the

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,250
footprint so you don't you don't need to

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,670
have like a huge workstation to do

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,640
development on on this solution you can

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,330
do it on your laptop

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:46,580
and we take particular care in ensuring

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:49,280
the bug ability and usability of CI Iran

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,050
so that you can actually manage by

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,700
yourself if you are a developer you have

00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,170
a good experience you can submit a patch

00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,600
you can look at the logs you can check

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,760
if something went wrong and we even had

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,370
system to try and catch common issues

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,690
and report automatically that something

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:08,060
went wrong so you don't have to debug

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:11,210
known situations yeah because I can get

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:16,600
pretty complex and we run a lot of tests

00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:19,910
just you know couple of words more about

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,760
QA since I was the the PTL for the QA

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,250
program there for a couple of cycles so

00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,920
we have a slightly different approach to

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,690
QA than like normal QA within a

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,900
corporation so it's a community led QA

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,730
we provide testing interface or tools

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,040
and things that project normally

00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,290
supposed to do in terms of testing but

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,670
we don't enforce like a central test

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,020
plan that everyone has to comply and

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,360
test this and that thing because

00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:47,120
actually the people writing the code and

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,060
working in a specific area of the

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,490
project or a specific project they know

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,570
best I mean we have 64 projects I think

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:58,550
in in OpenStack well some of them are

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:01,190
like horizontal project but still it's a

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:05,660
lot of them so we provide plugins within

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:07,730
our CI and QA tools so that every

00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,350
project can own their definition of

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:15,530
their CI jobs it has their right and so

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:19,870
and finally but last not least open

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,870
community so we have open governance

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:26,329
open governance we have a repository

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,640
where basically all the governance all

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:32,560
the rules of the policies for OpenStack

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,550
are written we have a concept of

00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,950
official project as I was saying before

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,900
so if you comply with like the OpenStack

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,560
way you can be an official project and

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:45,260
be hosted there and then every committee

00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,900
within that has every committed to one

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,630
of the official project in OpenStack can

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,330
be a candidate or can have a vote for

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,850
like the the Technical Committee which

00:17:53,330 --> 00:18:00,679
is the committee who has over technical

00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:04,970
oversight over OpenStack project and

00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:07,610
every committer to a specific project

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,110
can be a candidate or can elect the

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,500
project technical lead which is the

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,360
person the leader of the project who has

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,870
technical oversight on the project but

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:22,009
it's more like providing guidance to to

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:25,370
the project in terms of communication we

00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:27,730
put a lot of attention about

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,500
transparency so avoiding off-the-record

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:34,879
communication everything that we talked

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:37,789
about is usually recorded so if we do

00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,379
conversation it's in either in IRC or in

00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:41,919
the mailing list and the mailing list is

00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:43,429
archived and searchable and

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,879
communication should be always

00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:55,309
respectful inclusive and decisions are

00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:57,169
based on lazy consensus so that it means

00:18:55,309 --> 00:19:02,690
that things can take longer to be

00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:05,120
decided but I think it's it's a

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,700
compromise we have to be aware of and

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,299
this is just from a few years back in

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:14,720
Vancouver summit all the different type

00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:16,639
of contributors together and when I mean

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,200
contributors we have developers users

00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:20,000
and operators I said this already so

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,679
it's important to consider all type of

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,090
contribution not just code because

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,379
they're a different way to contribute

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,519
the community that's important to

00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,980
recognize different kind of

00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:31,129
contributions and it's important to

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:36,019
build trust between developers and

00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:39,080
between everyone in the community so

00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:42,169
just to conclude everything I talked

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:45,950
about it's a lot of mistakes but it's

00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:48,529
not only for OpenStack so everyone can

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,909
reuse the ideas and a lot of the

00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:54,350
toolings actually all the automation

00:19:49,909 --> 00:20:00,409
that we use to build these we care a lot

00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:04,050
about transparency and I think I wanted

00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:07,750
to make a short call to action here

00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:10,230
because if you were working in a company

00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:13,180
and contribute to an open-source project

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:18,160
within I've seen a lot of frustration

00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:20,560
often that with expectation which are

00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,870
not correct from the employer side the

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,240
point of view that they expect people

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:28,090
engineers to go in open source community

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:32,380
and just implement something but there

00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:34,360
is much more than that so there is you

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,150
need to build trust relationship you

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:41,200
need to give back to the community to do

00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:44,440
that so yeah just some reference the

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,020
presentation is on github and thank you

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:52,710
thank you very much Andrew

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:52,710
