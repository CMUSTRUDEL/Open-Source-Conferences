Title: #FOSSBack 18: Philipp Krenn â€“ Open Source as a Business: Strategy, Struggle & Success
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	How do you build a lasting and successful company that also stays true to its open source roots? This talk takes a look at why open source is important to business and three essential elements of this path:

- Strategy: How can you monetize your open source product? Is it support, an open core approach, cloud services, or a combination of the three? And which ones are the features you can even commercialize without alienating your community?
- Struggle: "You received a 100 million dollars in venture capital and yet you have so many open issues?!" Once money is involved the dynamics often change. How can you manage expectations and still build on a flourishing open source community?
- Success: How do you balance open source and commercial success? How do you align engineering and sales decisions?

This talk takes the perspective of Elastic, the company behind the open source products Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash, which makes its money with support, the commercial X-Pack extensions, and cloud offerings. But we are also taking a look at how others are approaching this challenge, what worked, and what failed.

	00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,840
thank you good morning and so this talk

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,850
is kind of combined with the slot

00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,469
afterwards so I will do a talk to kind

00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,869
of kick off the idea and afterwards

00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:18,369
there is a discussion and so I won't do

00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:20,470
any questions at the end and I would

00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:21,520
probably fill out the entire slot but

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,530
the discussion and everything will

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,900
happen right afterwards so don't run off

00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:29,200
afterwards so I want to talk a bit about

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,700
business and struggle and things that

00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,259
probably look like this

00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,199
everybody wants well-maintained

00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,700
open-source software few people want to

00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:39,430
contribute and nobody wants to maintain

00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,020
basically and this is kind of a common

00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,200
thing I guess most of you have seen or

00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,090
experienced in one way or another and

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,950
there are also people who say that the

00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,710
majority of their code for example here

00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:54,130
from puppet was contributed by somebody

00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,440
they actually paid because well doing

00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,079
open source in your free time works for

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,430
some projects but not for everything and

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,019
sometimes you want to have a company to

00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:06,579
sponsor and push stuff forward so I

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,179
think open-source is kind of like an

00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:12,869
advantage for every thing around doing a

00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:15,299
software project except for making money

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,520
there commercial software is probably

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,619
better off every for everything else

00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,450
it's probably the other way around why

00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:24,789
am I talking about that well I work for

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,399
elastic I'm developer advocate or

00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:29,529
whatever you call us I mostly talk about

00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:31,899
the stuff that we do in struggle that we

00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:33,459
have there and we have I guess most of

00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:35,770
you know our open-source products so

00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:37,090
these are the things that we put out in

00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,969
the open but we need to make money

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,889
somehow in somewhere and the common

00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:44,529
question is where is the money like

00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:47,169
where can you get the money from and we

00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:50,829
were kind of largest now we were getting

00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:54,609
close to 900 I think and you need to pay

00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:55,779
900 salaries so that's kind of some some

00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:58,209
money you need to make it's not just

00:01:55,779 --> 00:02:00,729
donations you can take in anymore so the

00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:03,189
first thing that I guess a lot of us try

00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,049
to do our services so you have support

00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:08,739
consulting training certification

00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:11,020
anything around that canonical for

00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:13,450
Ubuntu is doing that redhead obviously

00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,880
for anything they do is they're doing

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,990
that and reddit is amazingly successful

00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,250
with that every

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:22,570
please seen their revenue growth and

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,950
that's a pretty impressive number for

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,650
quarterly growth like they have been

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:30,040
very consistently been working on that

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,440
just by providing support so you might

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,790
think this is very easy and we'll just

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,520
do the same thing we'll offer support

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:40,630
and life will be great right the problem

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:43,360
is it's not that easy first thing is if

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,250
your product is very easy to use why

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,230
should I pay you and and then you have

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,270
this bad incentive to make your product

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,460
not easy to use so you can sell support

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,950
and that's probably not a place where

00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,780
you want to be that you kind of like the

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,180
success of your company belongs on

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,940
having and not that easy to use product

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,770
probably don't do that the other thing

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,880
that you often see is that renewal rates

00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,860
are not that great

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,750
because well people figure out how to

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,430
use your software first they pay support

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,170
after two or three years they evaluate

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,850
and say like well we didn't have any

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,320
major incidents we didn't need your

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,180
support really we know the product now

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,580
why should we still pay you X amount of

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,070
money we'll just skip the support

00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:24,540
contract and like renewal rates are

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:27,190
often bad like 70 percent or less and

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,750
that's also not very sustainable like as

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,120
soon as you have a mature user base they

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,130
probably don't want to pay you anymore

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,870
and then you have companies trying to do

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,910
consulting but the problem is if you do

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,980
consulting you will be competing with

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,660
all the only consulting companies and

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,760
you will probably be always more

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,590
expensive than those because you spent I

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,720
don't know 50 percent consulting 50

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,460
percent developing your own software

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,320
whereas somebody else can spend hundred

00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,090
percent consulting they might not know

00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,730
as much but they are probably like a

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,470
third or half of the cheaper or the

00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,150
price of what you offer and a lot of

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,210
companies will just take those who are

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,840
much cheaper and that's also not a great

00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,040
place to be the next thing that a lot of

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,170
companies do is and I'm probably

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,690
conflating multiple things here you have

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,850
some open source offering but then you

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,730
have some commercial extensions or

00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,830
plugins or whatever around it I just say

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,359
open core I think my sequel was that the

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,640
most prominent one with the do your line

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,990
sent with the GPL and if you wanted to

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,910
do anything else with the source code

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,490
you had to pay for it now they also have

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,540
some commercial features you only get

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,600
when you pay

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,060
the ecosystem is kind of very strong in

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,650
there I'll test I've put in mapper but

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,630
it probably applies to Claude Aaron to

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,630
Horton works in a similar fashion did

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,390
you have something as a core basis on

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,980
open source technology and then you have

00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,230
some other commercial extensions around

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,540
them and you might think well this is

00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,940
very easy I'll just do that the problem

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,740
is it doesn't solve all the problems

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,020
sometimes it's some somebody else will

00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,680
try to monetize on your hard work which

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:03,380
looks something like this one thing is

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,600
what do you commercialize oftentimes

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,030
it's something about security or scaling

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,040
or operating your software the problem

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,900
is some competitor could just come in

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,120
and say like oh we'll just provide the

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,460
monitoring for your solution or make it

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,080
easy to run that and while you're

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,180
spending your time building your product

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,970
somebody else will just compete with you

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,050
only on the commercial things and this

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,970
kind of load was a bit of a

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,760
disappearance also if you want to run

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,290
something because of the cloud providers

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,470
they will just take that business away

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,240
from you probably as well because well

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,310
running MapReduce used to be very hard

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,470
now you can just spin it off on up on

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,420
AWS so I don't need to buy any tooling

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:45,020
around it anymore because AWS has

00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,030
automated that part away from me yeah so

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,060
generally cloud providers are eating

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,400
into that and provide good solutions for

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,440
the end-user maybe not great solutions

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,820
for the open source project and the

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,980
final thing that a lot of people are

00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,410
kind of wary of is locking that once I

00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,410
am on your commercial products I cannot

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,000
use anything else for example for

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,770
Cassandra and data stacks if I remember

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,750
correctly if you're using the data text

00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,250
version if you want to go back to the

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,960
open source Cassandra version you

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,850
actually need to dump out your data and

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,590
re-import it because the storage format

00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,570
is somewhat different so there is this

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,230
lock in if you have lots of data that

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,390
will hurt you

00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,060
the final thing where people try to make

00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,220
money is cloud services of course to

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,410
companies that I think doing that very

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,590
successfully one of them is WordPress if

00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,020
you go to wordpress.org you got their

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,180
good or whatever CMS we could discuss

00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,280
about that if you go to wordpress.com

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,660
you will get it as a service and you

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,970
don't need to care about anything and

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,800
they have their own extensions then to

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,169
make that run better there

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,389
one that is also doing pretty well it's

00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:49,669
entry everything is open-source they do

00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,259
accept for their billing module and you

00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:52,610
can either run it yourself or you can

00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:54,379
just say like it's not worth the hassle

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,870
it's cheap enough I would just use their

00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:59,030
service the problem once again is

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,220
somebody might basically eat your lunch

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,530
which well could look something like

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,919
this

00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:09,530
and once again this might be cloud

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:12,500
providers for example because well you

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,750
have this nice shiny Apache BSD whatever

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,520
license product everybody wants to use

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,129
that I will just provide it as a service

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,110
for the customers and they are totally

00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:24,530
entitled to do that or they can legally

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,030
do that but it doesn't make it very may

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,770
be ethical is the wrong word but it

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,520
doesn't make it right or it doesn't help

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:33,259
the open-source product in the end

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,000
yeah I like this quote open-source

00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,710
software was not so that someone else

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,650
can take the exact same software and all

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,479
failure as a service because yeah that

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,490
is what oftentimes happens somebody else

00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,830
is basically making money of what you

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,479
were building and probably not

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,900
contributing back so that is one of the

00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:53,240
challenges you have how to circumvent at

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,340
MongoDB did that quite well they are a

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,380
GPL licensed and I think that's one of

00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,300
the reasons why for example there were

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,020
very few cloud services that offered

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,909
Amazon

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,099
sorry not Amazon but MongoDB as a

00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:06,860
service for example Amazon did not

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:09,229
provide MongoDB as a service and they're

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,849
providing lots of other data stores as a

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:12,259
service but not MongoDB and they were

00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,819
very late to the game they have now

00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,159
their own cloud offering which is called

00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,409
Atlas but they only started at like two

00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:20,740
years ago or so nobody wanted to touch

00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:23,629
that so that might sound like a good bet

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:28,090
but it might also not be um who knows

00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:31,959
that logo anybody in the Microsoft the

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:35,419
ecosystem that's cosmos DP they're

00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:37,039
highly I don't know I've hyped or they

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,810
are trying to push that a lot it has

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,390
multiple models it can do lots of things

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,250
can do relational graph it came store

00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,160
documents and what they have done is

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:50,870
they've basically taken the API said

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,459
MongoDB is providing and then you can

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,680
just interact with those api's and

00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:56,600
they've basically replaced MongoDB so

00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,639
that is in my opinion

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,440
worse place to be in basically because

00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,509
of the a GPL license nobody wants to use

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,350
your software but people want to use the

00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,389
wire protocol

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,889
so you just reimplemented wire protocol

00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:09,470
but you get rid of the original vendor

00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:11,990
and that puts you I think in a much

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,639
worse position than if you're cause

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,110
somebody is using your software as a

00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:19,610
service it's still yours and you can

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:22,190
still steer it okay so how do you

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,630
continue with the struggle yeah they're

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,670
always kind of devout just looking out

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:29,029
for victims to use somebody's software

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:31,540
and profit out of that I don't want to

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:34,160
bash Microsoft here in general but yeah

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,670
if somebody sounds like already's and

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,019
you think ah you mean aja Reddy's cash

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,389
that will not make the creators of red

00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,579
is very happy if people don't even know

00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:45,440
the project anymore and just think well

00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:47,209
it's an SEO service and that is what I'm

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,259
using and they don't care about the

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:52,100
original open-source product anymore

00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:54,350
yeah and the other thing that is

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,380
probably important is if you say you're

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,690
doing open source stuff you should

00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,959
contribute back upstream otherwise

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,579
you're just using stuff and well we we

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,290
have the two that other products build

00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:07,819
on top of us and build a thin layer of

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,680
something on top of us and there is

00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:11,149
nothing coming back and that doesn't

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,240
make us very happy as an open source

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:19,009
project either okay next thing that

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,930
might be a problem our users I guess

00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:24,139
everybody has to have their experiences

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,750
my one of my examples is we had this

00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:29,180
post some time ago on our discuss forums

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,209
that somebody complained that the Ruby

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,170
and rails integration we were doing is

00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:35,480
abandoned and not good and they were

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:39,740
mightily complaining what is the obvious

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,660
question that you're asking them maybe

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,720
you want to maintain something and the

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,060
answer is of course not

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,310
that is I guess most of you have seen

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,290
something like that already but yeah

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:56,120
whenever we see that we're like okay

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:59,269
great and yeah this is the homebrew

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,290
author you're entitled to your immediate

00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:05,180
refund of zero and if you're not happy

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,600
with an open-source product and and that

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:10,300
is how you should view that we did have

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,250
a lengthy argument

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,470
dr. Chang jumped in as well and then

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,450
there's always this nice argument well

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,560
this company got I don't know that much

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,960
money in funding

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,700
why should I do work for free for them

00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,130
and that's also another problem that

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,960
kind of like once somebody got money

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,420
kind of the incentives are different and

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,710
people have a different view on that

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,650
which I don't think makes this right

00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,120
this behavior but yes some people just

00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:39,650
say like why should I do anything I just

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,450
want free stuff and do it and yeah could

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:44,120
that argue like it is really dead or not

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,620
you can see this was how this Ruby

00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,260
driver was developing and I think it's

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,950
maybe a bit sleepy but it's it's still

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,890
working and it's doing the right thing

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:58,370
but we decided we want to hire one more

00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,760
maintainer to do that and we have a new

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,080
colleague

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,460
I think she's called Emily she's even

00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,830
based in Berlin and she will maintain

00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,110
that now and put more effort into that

00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,730
so for that we decided to actually do

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,620
that and take the complaint seriously

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,600
and try to help out the community but

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,100
it's not always the case and I've had

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,230
that with other open-source products as

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,910
well where stuff just is like it's too

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:21,710
much scope you cannot cover everything

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:23,780
for example MongoDB has this Java ORM or

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,760
they call it ODM object document mapping

00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,680
called morphia and you can totally see

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,480
this is how it this has been developing

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,950
over the past few years so every now and

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,110
then somebody is doing something and

00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,520
then it's kind of dead and then somebody

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,340
decides okay we need to do something and

00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,890
then it's kind of dead again and with

00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:43,970
you I think it's kind of dead for good

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:45,980
now but I'm not sure I used that at my

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,930
previous company and I think they are

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,670
now finally biting the bullet and trying

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,440
to migrate away but this is stuff that

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,120
happens even if you have a big company

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,620
and you have lots of money there's so

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,770
much ground to cover you cannot cover

00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,440
everything so hopefully somebody from

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:05,030
the community will step up okay and then

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,680
there's always the business side venture

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,510
capital is nice if you want to have this

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,220
accelerated development and you want to

00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,460
have like okay I want to hire 50 new

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,050
people to work on all these things the

00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:19,970
problem is it also changes the entire

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:23,700
dynamics so where is the toxic problem

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:25,980
or where's the issue first off

00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,620
it's very hard to find this sweet spot

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,360
about having a proper open source

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,030
product that is usable on its own and

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,700
not starving the company and that the

00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:38,670
two examples that I have here are in

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,580
flexi B we have this internal joke we

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,830
always call it to pull an influx is when

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,540
they put every scaling they hat point

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,460
into their commercial offering and all

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,890
high availability and scaling and influx

00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:53,010
is not open source anymore which kind of

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:54,930
narrowed their use case a lot the other

00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,910
thing is reading TP which was widely

00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,590
loved and everybody wanted to use that

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,920
and said well this is a great product

00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,660
but it didn't find a good use case or

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,790
monetize way to monetize it and they

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,560
went bankrupt and are pretty much dead I

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,900
think if the code is open and has been

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,330
put into the Linux Foundation but there

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,770
has not been any major development for

00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,600
more than a year so this is pretty much

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,240
dead so this also doesn't help anybody

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,460
if your product ends up like this and

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,930
the final one is probably talker they

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,450
are not there yet but probably at some

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,910
point all the venture capital will run

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:31,170
out and I don't see any good business

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,640
there we'll see okay the other thing is

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,560
how do you release stuff do you have

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,530
multiple products or do you have

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,950
proprietary plugins so for example data

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,300
sects they have basically taken over and

00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,330
have a different version which is called

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,800
data sticks I don't know if they even

00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,970
call themselves Cassandra anymore but

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,860
that's a very different product in

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,960
Apache Cassandra and they will also bash

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,670
the Petra Cassandra and say like oh our

00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,500
software is three or five or whatever

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,650
times faster than the the open source

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:02,100
one QT for example they have plugins to

00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,390
plug in to their software and yeah and

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,250
then you have this discussion open

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,190
source versus open code where you do you

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:10,080
put the code that you where you need a

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,360
commercial license to use it but maybe

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,490
it can be viewable and the two projects

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,320
which I've seen which are doing that get

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,270
lap you can see their commercial code

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,740
get lap EE but you need a commercial

00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,460
license to use so then it's a separate

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,200
package cockroach labs which has this

00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,370
relational database that is not you

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,220
cannot kill that's why they're called

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,200
cockroach I think they have it in the

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,300
same repository but you need a

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,510
commercial license to use some of the

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,260
features that they have in there yeah

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,490
and then you

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,080
always have to fight like engineering

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,910
wants to put everything into open-source

00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,710
and sales wants to put everything into

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,090
the commercial license but there's

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,650
probably no way around that this would

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:49,860
be an ongoing discussion that you always

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,300
need to have so what are we doing we

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,830
always say we have this elastic heart

00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,430
which is the open source heart that we

00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:58,950
have we have an open source version we

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,930
have a free version that no other cloud

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,220
provider can use this is kind of a bit

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,690
of a protection account it's the other

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,470
cloud providers and we have commercial

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:09,180
plugins then and these are put together

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,010
into we call off that all of our

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,050
commercial plugins expec and they're

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,940
always going hand with hand with support

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,620
because otherwise we've seen that the

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,020
retention rate of support is pretty bad

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,210
and once you're using the commercial

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,280
plugins the retention rates for support

00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:25,250
are much better and then we don't need

00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,840
to make our products harder to use or

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:31,920
kind of bad documentation or anything to

00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,840
keep people to pay support we have

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,510
opened the code now and everything is in

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,520
one repository we have like a patch to

00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,050
license and our own commercial license

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,690
so you for some features you will need

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,430
to have a commercial license so by now

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,270
we have everything in one repository

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,280
everything is Apache - licensed only one

00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,720
folder has the expec code where you will

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,660
need a commercial license to actually

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,920
use that which pretty much looks like

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,710
this you have this open source space

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,470
then you have expect on top of it which

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,940
is split into free and paid features but

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,030
everything lives in the same repository

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,410
and you can see what is going on we do

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,910
have training and consulting but that's

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,100
kind of like very small and doesn't

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,040
scale much we do try to offer our

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,810
service as a cloud on various cloud

00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,780
providers we do also have some

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:20,600
orchestration thing on-premise or in

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,070
your own cloud account so it's basically

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,310
kubernetes plus more to orchestrate your

00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:28,770
services in your own accounts and we

00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,280
even sell swag so if you want to buy

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,970
anything

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,590
we even have elastic dot shop and we try

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,300
to make a little bit of money out of

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:39,510
everything work that we can basically

00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,330
just to keep the open-source going so to

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,800
wrap up I don't want to give the

00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,780
impression that business is mandatory

00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,220
business is optional there are some very

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,200
successful open-source products which

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,180
are not super Mershon in the background

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,120
and are going very well I guess both

00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,500
is the one that everybody knows and the

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,320
other one is and that's a very

00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:02,310
interesting blog post about envoi which

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:06,240
is yeah this new thing around in the

00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:10,350
orchestration space and they actually

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,660
decided well it came out of which

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,770
company is that I think lift if I'm not

00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,870
mistaken but lots of others are

00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,940
contributing now and they had this point

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,580
where they were like okay should we try

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,710
to build a product out of this but Matt

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,660
who is was the original author was like

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,340
no it's not really what I want to do and

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,230
we want to keep this open source it's

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,780
intentionally not going to be a product

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:34,650
or a company and it's going very well

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,210
for them the other thing is business is

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,220
complicated and for us this looks

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,560
something like this like this here is

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,850
the open source part these are the paid

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,680
features with go hand-in-hand with

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:46,170
support this is what we try to do as a

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,400
cloud offering but it is not easy and

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,350
you need probably to have multiple

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,900
strategies if one of them fails to have

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,660
like some other way and like combine all

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,520
the money to keep the company afloat

00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,410
I guess we'll skip the questions and

00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,150
we're pretty much out of time and we'll

00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,950
hand over to the discussion afterwards

00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,580
I'll stick around for the discussion so

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,550
if anything is in your in the question

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,890
space I will be there as well we're good

00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:16,530
time wasn't everything we will continue

00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:21,090
in Iran first of all Thank You Philip my

00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:23,150
pleasure thank you

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,150
