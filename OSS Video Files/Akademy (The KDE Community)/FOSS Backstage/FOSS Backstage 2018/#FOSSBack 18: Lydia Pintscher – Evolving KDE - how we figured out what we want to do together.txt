Title: #FOSSBack 18: Lydia Pintscher â€“ Evolving KDE - how we figured out what we want to do together
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	KDE was founded more than 20 years ago, making it one of the longest-living free software projects. KDE started out creating a desktop for Linux. Over those years the world around KDE has changed rapidly - new devices, different expectations from our users, more and more things happening in the cloud. The good old desktop alone wasn't going to keep us relevant anymore and you could see it in the community. We became more splintered and demotivated while the need for free software for people's day-to-day work grew and grew.

In this talk I'd like to take you through our long but rewarding efforts of figuring out our place and strategy in a new world and how we did this collaboratively with the whole community.

thank you very much and thank you for

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,410
coming even though their soccer outside

00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,790
very brave um I want to talk about

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,160
evolving KDE

00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,490
how many of you have actually heard of

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:27,130
Katy almost everyone

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:30,680
amazing so KDE started with this email

00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,920
new project cool desktop environment

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:40,160
programmers wanted that was what Matias

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:43,370
at which sent out in 1996 to start a new

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:49,070
desktop environment for Linux for

00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:50,390
end-users and it should be a GUI because

00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,690
there were a lot of command-line things

00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,550
already and he was very expressive about

00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,770
what he wanted to do and what he wanted

00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,989
to have and who he wanted to build it

00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,270
for he wanted to build it for somebody

00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:04,550
who wants to browse the web with Linux

00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:08,930
write some letters and play some nice

00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:13,610
games and that was what drove Katie's

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:19,939
development for a very long time we had

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:21,490
KDE 1 and KD 2 and Kelly is free that

00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:28,610
was around the time when I enter in KDE

00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:31,280
and at that point we feel really stable

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,530
it's awesome we had a lot of users who

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,900
really liked what we were doing so at

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:41,360
that point we said we have to get all

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,600
the technical depth that we have done

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,140
and all the changes that are done in our

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,659
underlying toolkit and and basically

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,720
make a lot of really fundamental changes

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:58,130
so we're ready for the future which

00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:01,280
brought us to Katie for now some of you

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:04,009
might know that was technically

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,759
excellent in terms of how our users

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:08,899
perceived it unfortunately not so much

00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,540
because a lot of the things they have

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:16,640
learnt you love about KDE went there in

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:18,740
hey 4.0 and we added them back

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,060
through the releases that came after

00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:26,180
that so we had an excellent technical

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,520
base and attacked an excellent testament

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,440
why I meant a lot of programs around it

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,209
like critter or natural painting program

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,100
model or a desktop globe

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:39,050
and many many more um so in some way we

00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:45,920
had reached what matthias a tree set out

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:49,130
to do in 1996 around the same time we

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:54,080
also moved our version control system

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:56,900
from as we had took it so before that we

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,900
were all in one big as we are repository

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:04,130
everyone was committing to everything

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:08,060
one shared space in yet that was very

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:10,370
different and Conway's law says that if

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,290
you split up your infrastructure like

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,140
that your community will split up like

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:19,760
that too and surprise this is exactly

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:22,630
what happened so we had this problem led

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:28,459
it didn't feel like one cohesive

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:29,989
community anymore on top of that the

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,920
world around us was clearly changing

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,220
people were using mobile phones more

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,190
smartwatches

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,519
personal assistants lots of things we're

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,920
moving into the cloud everyone wanted to

00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:47,290
start their own startup and get filthy

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:53,209
rich and that stops just where the cool

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:54,829
new thing anymore all of this together

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,380
meant that we no longer had really

00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:59,900
compelling answers when people asked why

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,970
are we actually here why are we doing

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,260
this what keeps us all together as one

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,790
community and why should anyone join

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,320
that isn't to say there weren't reasons

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,670
for that right there totally where there

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,700
were answers for that but they were very

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:18,140
fuzzy and it got harder and harder for

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:21,640
us to articulate them that fraud quite

00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:26,630
some issues with us worth it for us a

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:29,060
lack of guiding principles meant that we

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,439
lacked a base for a lot of the decisions

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,869
and discussions we were having

00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:38,709
leading the community issues a lack of a

00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:41,330
common vision we could strive for after

00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:45,169
with more or less of the first one we

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,559
had and that of course means we had a

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:50,569
lot of hard time recruiting new people

00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:53,449
because if we can't tell someone why

00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:58,029
they should join that's not a good sign

00:04:53,449 --> 00:05:06,519
and our public perception still was

00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:09,679
suffering from kt4 and at that point a

00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:12,379
lot of people in the communities felt

00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:16,099
that something had to be done and that's

00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:18,289
why we started evolving KT in 2015 with

00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:22,159
the goal to bring clarity to the

00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:24,679
question where are we where do we want

00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:33,079
to go and how do we get from here to

00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:35,089
there it started in April 2015

00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,589
with announcement hey we need to talk

00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:39,499
about these questions and we need to

00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:44,569
find answers to those questions and we

00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:45,860
did a survey and after a while we

00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:47,779
published a survey results in some

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,409
document recommendations based on that

00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:53,959
survey and I presented that I didn't

00:05:51,409 --> 00:06:00,050
Ricci node in our annual conference and

00:05:53,959 --> 00:06:03,050
we discussed about those parts or the

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:06,919
result of that survey basically said we

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,169
have a great community there were quotes

00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,969
in the in the survey answers like

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,679
there's a sense of working for the

00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:15,349
greater good that drives the community

00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:16,909
it is welcoming and friendly and able to

00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:19,279
integrate people from very different

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,959
backgrounds and cultures for me it

00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,749
represents the ideal of what a free

00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,629
software community should be so people

00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:31,550
really saw something very valuable in

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:37,159
our community people are very proud of

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:39,860
our technology and people cared a lot

00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:42,680
about the impact they could have while

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,890
contributing to Katie

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:50,070
um they care about giving freedom to our

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:52,230
users because they thought unlike my

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,300
friend Ashish honesty was his t-shirt

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,970
that says I wasn't using my civil rights

00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,170
anyway they thought no I want to use my

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:03,630
civil rights I want to have freedom and

00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:09,480
need the technology to be able to

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:11,580
exercise that and a lot of people of

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,400
course wanted to scratch their own itch

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:19,380
fix something that bothered them solve a

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,810
problem for themselves and KDE

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:26,100
has always been a community that

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:28,680
welcomes new people and learning trying

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,130
things out mentoring and everything

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:39,390
around them so those were things that

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:41,520
people valued oh yes and for example

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,260
someone said the right variety of people

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,820
involved in the past years it did teach

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,910
me to see the world in different ways

00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,190
and I think that really puts it in a

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:55,730
nice way what kiddie means to her to

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:58,470
someone and we also ask people like what

00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,000
what's keeping you from contributing

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,900
more to Kelly what's keeping you from

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,940
enjoying it more and so on and as I

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,419
think in every free software project the

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,040
biggest thing was time and energy it was

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:13,940
hard for people to find the time to

00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:19,200
contribute as much as they would like to

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:21,240
another thing was skills that they

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,720
didn't have or think they didn't have a

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,580
lack of tutorials to get those skills

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:32,160
and unclear entry points for them and

00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:35,060
the biggest thing a lack of vision

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:39,289
strategy and focus for the community

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:42,330
that we could orient ourselves towards

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,760
someone for example say why we're not

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,660
always moving in the same direction we

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:53,300
always want to move forward on the one

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:57,590
hand that's great but also not

00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:00,490
and it's kind of said that we weren't

00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:03,920
able to channel that energy in a

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:09,080
direction that benefits everyone who is

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:12,830
using our software so what we did was

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,600
tackle exactly that problem first write

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:19,850
down and before the discuss of course

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,200
what our vision actually is and we

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:28,310
started that discussion in August 2015

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:34,820
and that went on until April 2000 2015

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:36,710
and went on until April 2016 and the

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,870
outcome of that is the world in which

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,900
everyone has control over their digital

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,760
life and enjoys freedom and privacy this

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,840
is what we want to strive for this is

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,520
what we want to provide to our users now

00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:54,470
it took us some time to get to this but

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,020
this was still relatively easy to get

00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,600
agreement on because it was high level

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:04,520
enough for people to see themselves in

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:08,780
this and and see this as what we've been

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,360
doing for a long time but at the same

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:15,170
time people were like okay that's great

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,500
and helpful but we need something more

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:23,380
concrete now how do we turn this into

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:26,540
something that's actually actionable so

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,230
we started working on our mission and

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:33,200
started brainstorming around dad and

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:36,500
that was the most difficult part of the

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,380
process because this was the level where

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,010
people really cared and where it was

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:46,180
concrete enough for people to say no I

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:50,090
don't think that's what we're doing she

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,970
we should talk about that and and people

00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,050
were understandably very attached to

00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:00,020
what they were thinking

00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:02,570
um and one of the things that we saw

00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,700
happening was that we that people are

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,520
talking a lot about from their own

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,730
experience and from their own

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:13,029
thinking around us without us being able

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,790
to say this is what a larger community

00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:18,370
and our users think so we did another

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,820
survey with questions more geared

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:25,750
towards what we wanted for the mission

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:29,860
and used that as a basis for continued

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:34,350
drafting of the mission and under the

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:40,630
buff at academy our annual conference to

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:42,880
kind of wordsmith that to a state where

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:46,480
we were kind of happy with it but not

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:51,850
really and everyone had a little thing

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:54,940
in it that didn't feel right and at that

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,959
point and that's also I think the point

00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:02,080
where that I regret most in the process

00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:05,529
we let it sit for way too long without

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,310
pushing it forward because it was such a

00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:14,020
hard position to to move forward from

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:16,720
everyone kind of didn't thought it

00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:22,390
didn't feel right quite right but it was

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:24,880
also hard to move away from that and in

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,470
May 2017 we sat down at the board

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,260
meeting an extended board meeting where

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:32,620
the board and a few other people met and

00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:35,950
looked at it again and said like this

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:39,459
isn't actually so hard after we looked

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:42,459
at it several months later and we split

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:45,670
it into a part that is actually mission

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:48,610
and a partner strategy and that solved a

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,200
lot of our issues and then we discussed

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,800
the remaining points at the next Academy

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,529
and close the discussion but as you can

00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,270
see it took us over a year for this

00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:03,490
whole thing and that was way too long

00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,350
right and the outcome of that this is

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:09,310
this I'm not going to read all of the

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:12,010
stuff um and I'm actually quite happy

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,579
with it and again it it becomes more

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:19,930
concrete and people have more to hold on

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:23,140
to but again people ask okay but

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:29,460
what do I do today what how how do I put

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:35,320
that into action today fair question

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:38,860
we started talking about goals and what

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,230
we did was tell people they can propose

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,990
goals they have some time to draft them

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,970
of what people should or what kitty as a

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,660
whole should rally behind for the next

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:55,380
three to four years anyone could come

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:57,370
and propose a goal in our fabricator and

00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,700
discuss it with other people

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:05,020
refine it have people join and express

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,820
interest and so on and then we had a

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:12,130
vote with everyone who has a contributor

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:14,950
account and in November 2017 we had

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:18,460
three winning goals that were selected

00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:23,350
and this is what the fabricator board

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:25,240
look like and these are the goals in

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,550
short firm or short form

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,020
thought not top-notch usability and

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,330
productivity for basic software

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:35,230
basically fixing all the small annoying

00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:38,310
things people keep asking for privacy

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:42,720
software giving people better tools to

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:46,630
improve the privacy of their system and

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,670
respecting their privacy more and so on

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,220
and seam line onboarding of new

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:55,839
contributors so lowering barriers of

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:57,490
entry adding lots of documentation all

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,440
these kinds of things that help people

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:04,029
get into the community and the good site

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,540
or the really cool thing that I didn't

00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:10,900
expect that happened is that of those

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,940
three goals to where proposed by people

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,220
who hadn't been part of the core

00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:19,570
community before but who were new people

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:21,250
and those are the two really are driving

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:26,350
their goal and and getting people

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:28,030
involved and that's really cool so what

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,970
does it get us of course this whole

00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,370
thing didn't fix everything but it gave

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,470
us

00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:38,440
directionally gave us more community

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:41,620
cohesion and engagement we have great

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,560
new people joining us and our public

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:48,070
perception looks a lot a lot better

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,170
today than it did a few years ago and we

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:53,470
have companies communities other

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,810
projects interested in partnerships with

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,060
us because we can talk about what we're

00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,970
doing much better and why we're doing it

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:03,399
now not all of that of course came from

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,110
this process but I believe a lot of that

00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:11,560
what's really helped with that

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:16,630
lessons learned it was a not an easy

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:20,520
process I have to say and I learned

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:23,320
quite a lot and I one of the things is

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:27,399
in order to go through that with a large

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:30,730
community you need to have a sense of

00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,940
urgency and pain in that community they

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:37,660
need to see that there is a problem and

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:41,770
that they want to fix it otherwise this

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:44,920
is futile over communicate and over

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:47,110
involve there so saying if you're not

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,680
sick of hearing your own message you

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:55,029
haven't talked about it often enough

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:57,070
there is something to that be ready to

00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:59,650
put in the work and follow through this

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,170
is a lot of work and if you're starting

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:05,020
a process like that

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:09,160
you can't stop halfway because people

00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:11,199
will be very upset and uneasy and you're

00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:15,280
leaving the project in a in a limbo

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,240
state where it doesn't really know where

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,670
to go from there

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:23,890
don't do that and it really helps to

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,569
have a trusted group of people you can

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,030
bounce ideas off and you can get

00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:31,270
feedback get feedback from and to tell

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,360
you truthfully what's working and what's

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,360
not

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,890
another thing that I learned is that you

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,320
have to be really clear of what you mean

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:47,840
when you say mission wishing strategy

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,530
and all these words because everyone

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,860
understands them differently and these

00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:57,170
subtle differences mean a lot of

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,930
communication and issues in that

00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:02,030
communication for no good reason because

00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:07,520
people misunderstand the level you're

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:09,080
talking on and so on and it's really

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,990
important to listen to people's fear

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,630
that come up in these processes so for

00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,970
example there was a lot of fear in our

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,160
discussions around or are we abandoning

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,990
the desktop now are we abandoning what

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,980
we've been doing for more than twenty

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:27,260
years and it really helps to dig into

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:30,430
that and understand where that fear is

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,630
coming from and how you can address it

00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:35,660
another thing that was super helpful for

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:38,990
us was to get data the truth service we

00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:42,200
did really help to get away from a lot

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:46,970
of I think the community thinks this or

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:50,570
I know everyone thinks this No do the

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:53,720
survey and have data that you can talk

00:18:50,570 --> 00:19:02,330
about and reliably have you have a

00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:06,620
question sorry lime sorry it's what we

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:12,440
used post for the surveys and the vote

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:15,650
at the end yes and be ready as to adapt

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,380
as you go this didn't work out as I had

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:23,930
planned and initially but that was okay

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:26,240
we adapted as we went along and I hope

00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:29,840
some of you will join us all of you will

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,940
join us because we have our vision now

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,800
we have our goals and we welcome new

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,820
contributors to join us make them real

00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,820
thank you

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:49,640
we have some time for more questions

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:56,660
maybe one question or two but not really

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:58,670
much time yes hi I was wondering about

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:06,410
how many people were involved in that

00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:11,450
process at the various stages so the the

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:13,880
initial survey for for evolving KDE I

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:18,020
think was taken by two to three hundred

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:23,420
people the vote emails went out to I

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:26,240
think about 500 and about one third to

00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,360
half of them actually voted and I got a

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,210
lot of emails from people saying oh

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,920
thank you that you're reaching out to me

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,270
because they hadn't heard from her in a

00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,310
very long time but they still had an

00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,680
account and so I think we might even

00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:51,260
have reactivated one or two people for

00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:53,960
that which was cool the question I had

00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:58,370
is so you know given that you did this

00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:01,580
exercise in mapping out what the top

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:05,060
priorities were what are some of the

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:10,970
areas that KDE is targeting in terms of

00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:13,820
new features and platforms um so right

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:17,150
now we're working on for example plasma

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:20,330
Mobile which is interface for mobile

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:23,090
phones an adaption of our desktop

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,790
basically which was one of the things

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:29,480
that was made possible with all the work

00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:32,240
we've done for kt4 and which is now

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,090
paying off same for for tablets of

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,680
course and so on we also have a group of

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,130
people who are looking into the

00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,080
automotive space for example yeah

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:43,550
so those are currently two areas where

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,620
we're looking at you and of course

00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,870
continuing to provide a good desktop

00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,789
because I think today that's even more

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:53,969
important than it ever has been

00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:56,399
this is a desktop that cares about your

00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:59,269
privacy about you being able to change

00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:05,519
it in the way you want it and so on

00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:08,639
giving you the control or word does that

00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:11,629
become KDE light then the mobile version

00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:16,259
or is because you know there is a lot of

00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:19,399
interest in a light version that you can

00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:22,529
actually run on different devices yes

00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:26,669
sonoda is no KDE light what we have done

00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:29,459
is actually make KDE software lighter

00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:33,690
and it's now running one really cheap

00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:36,460
and low key hardware okay thank you

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:42,859
again Lydia thank you very much

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:42,859
