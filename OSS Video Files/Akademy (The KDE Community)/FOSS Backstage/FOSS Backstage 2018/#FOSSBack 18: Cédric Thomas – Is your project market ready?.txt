Title: #FOSSBack 18: Cédric Thomas – Is your project market ready?
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Is your project market ready? Defining Collaboratively the Open Source Market Readiness Index: Progress Report, Lessons and Challenges.

As it becomes increasingly mainstream, OSS reaches out to conventional decision makers who are far from free software advocates. These business managers expect more than code, they expect a product. Not all open source projects are global stars of the software world. For the majority of outsider open source projects, the challenge is to align with the experience and expectations that conventional decision makers have developed in dealing with well established commercial proprietary software vendors. 

To address this challenge and provide guidance to both developers and decision makers, we, at OW2, have endeavored to develop an Open Source Market Readiness Index. At OW2 we are convinced this tool must be collaboratively designed, built and maintained by those who will use it, the open source market participants and, in the first place, leaders, contributors and users of open source projects. 

As we started working on it as a transparent and open process we learned some valuable lessons and discovered unexpected challenges. After a quick introduction to the concept and the methodology this talk is a progress report and a presentation of a workable Market Readiness Scale that will undoubtedly raise questions and invite feedback.

thank you thank you for the kind

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,500
introduction good afternoon all I'm

00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,889
Cedric Thomas I read notably too we are

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,230
an open source organization and we host

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,840
three dozen projects many of them are

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,480
targeting infrastructure functionalities

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,359
and there are complex components for the

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,429
information systems so we we don't deal

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,929
much with we deal with software

00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:32,610
developers but we also deal with end

00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:35,350
users and we are often confronted to the

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,230
situation where entries is often prefer

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,570
proprietary solutions and we realize

00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,000
that it's often because open-source

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:48,580
software might not fit exactly their

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,190
expectations so this is sorry there so

00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,320
this is about open source for the

00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,140
business decision maker for the event

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,630
average the conventional manager the

00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,190
person who is not necesary sold on

00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,950
operative we're not in the process

00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,140
activist and someone who really are

00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,659
would much prefer dealing with

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,729
proprietary vendors and the thing is

00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,799
between the average developer and many

00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:13,600
developers in this conference who have

00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,179
the developers they talk to other

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,570
developers and this money for instance

00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:21,340
one of the keynotes highlighted the fact

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,869
that we should stop looking inward but

00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,630
looking outside and consider ourselves

00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:27,670
that we fit in a broader market and this

00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,229
broader market is out there but from the

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,999
point of view of the developer the

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,280
broader market is a little bit far away

00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:35,469
and we think there is a gap between the

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,079
devil developer between the software

00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:40,390
that is developed and what the end user

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,659
is looking for its identify if I may

00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,689
take this analogy like music this is

00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:49,770
music and music is the code but what the

00:01:46,689 --> 00:02:05,010
user wants is really the final project

00:01:49,770 --> 00:02:07,590
[Music]

00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,600
so this is not exactly what you read

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,290
this is what you feel this is what you

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,240
enjoy this is where the value is as I

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,970
said programmers write code code this

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,710
takes you don't do anything with text

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,720
but what the end users want it's a

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,450
product and the product is not just the

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,020
code it's code plus a lot of things

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:32,690
documentation training contracts pricing

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:36,540
roadmaps support other other users

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,610
marketing etc and in the case in the

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,500
case of operations of software there is

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,090
even more they need to trust the

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,770
software because they don't know because

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,530
some for many conventional decision

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,320
makers the open source software is a

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,640
little bit evil so they want to trust

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,460
the software they want to know where it

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,830
goes so this is what they want and that

00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,750
creates the value but the value is not

00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,970
only created by the developer it's

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,680
created by the ecosystem they consist

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,900
them are the distributors the systems

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,580
integrators the consulting companies the

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,680
contributors themselves the users

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,870
themselves even the open source

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,450
organizations we add value we create the

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,940
ecosystem that makes the software the

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,450
Opera Software valuable usable by the

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,400
average decision maker so the average

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,730
decision maker doesn't choose just on

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,690
the good face they want to know about

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:29,790
the software the components take let's

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,459
take another analogy with the automotive

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,640
industry today the leading car

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,830
manufacturers don't manufacture all the

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,610
cars what they do they integrate they

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:44,730
own the customer they own the trend they

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:47,250
they imagine the next car they analyze

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,400
the needs and then they have all the

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,980
parts don't provided by third-party

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,340
providers the front end is provided the

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,959
Lightning is provided by its not by them

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,170
the dashboard the sitting arrangement

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,870
the all the glass parts all this comes

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,940
from different suppliers of course today

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,770
the electronics all this comes from

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,800
different suppliers and we have the same

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:15,930
thing in in the in the software industry

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:18,510
this analysis by sono type found that 80

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,700
to 90 percent of new software come from

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,200
reuse components they don't say whether

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,310
they open-source components or not but

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,580
it's good a good proportion of these

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,080
reuse it comes from opposite of software

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,270
so we need to know what the components

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,430
are about and there is a very busy

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,930
landscape out there about measuring

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,270
components and understanding where they

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,580
come from so many of the tools have been

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,340
some of the tools have been described

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,350
here in this conference about how we

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,140
understand that the the software about

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,540
compliance governance etc and many tools

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,760
are there to help us understand what's

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,380
behind the component what's in the older

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,470
components and to make sure that we can

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,420
trust these components even at the w-2

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,670
we have developed our own platform for

00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,490
collecting data and reporting data to

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:08,640
the users we survey the the quality of

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,070
the code the IP of the code etc and that

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,440
generates a lot of data we generate too

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,100
much data in fact we publish this data

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,990
we want to be transparent the users can

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:25,770
access all about the the project we host

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,600
but can they make decision we are at

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,520
this stage what we feel that we need to

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,620
help the decision maker the decision

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,110
maker is not the open source software

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,520
architects or developer the decision

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,520
maker we have in mind is the average

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,220
decision maker who often select a

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,290
component a software on the under

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,540
reputation of a name so we need

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,450
something simple and we are thinking of

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,720
moving towards a more simple synthetic

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,820
indicator that's what we're doing so

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,290
when we're looking at a simple indicator

00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,840
we have something called the the NASA

00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,970
technology readiness levels you've heard

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:09,170
of these readiness levels it's a type of

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:13,320
mention measurement that allows us to

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:15,690
understand to evaluate the maturity of a

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,850
technology it's been very successful

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,680
it's been reused by the Department of

00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,660
Defense Department of Energy and now

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,550
it's you see it in any research project

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:29,280
proposal that's what it looks like it

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:31,650
has nine levels and these ninth levels

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,400
go from the bottom where you only have

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,470
the idea of the

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,710
it's something that no one can do

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,720
anything with up to the top level where

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,750
you have the components that has been

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:49,250
orbiting around the planet and came back

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:53,940
if it had come back from useful to use

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,620
from useless to useful so we we feel

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,350
that we can do something like that and

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,070
we have developed our own template like

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:06,990
the NASA TRL levels we've developed the

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:08,310
W to market readiness levels from a code

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,220
that is in the process of being

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,250
developed to establish project establish

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,210
product that any average user can

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:20,370
contrast but this is just it's a good

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,440
idea like that in fact we have to

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,020
develop this and we need to rely on data

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,210
we need to rely on tools that skander

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,849
cause that's kind of communities we need

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,919
to collect a lot of data and that's what

00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:36,690
I would like I wanted to share with you

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,160
this evening and asking contributions so

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,349
it's a kind of request for comment what

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,900
I'm doing here and we have a establish

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:46,050
already our methodology the mythology is

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:49,770
in five steps the first step is to

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:52,199
define the metrics metrics that are

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,020
relevant to what we want to do to want

00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,389
to want to express metrics that is

00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,460
available as well there is no need to

00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:03,090
look in for metric that cannot be

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,650
collected this matrix we have to collect

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,500
it but there is a feedback loop because

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,510
it evolves like any index like like

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,979
Stock Exchange index that involved so we

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:16,380
need to be able to to update this as the

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,810
situation evolves then these metrics

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:22,050
have to be put in certain format then

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:25,050
next once we have these metrics in our

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,530
mind and when I say format can be dates

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,150
etc we want to collect this metrics and

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,270
correcting the metrics can be done in

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,159
several ways automatically through many

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,469
of the tools that are out there for

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,169
instance we use we use force ology now

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,950
we use scan code a sonar cube we upload

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,890
some gitlab

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,330
I mean the the development

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,700
infrastructure that used but develop

00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,320
provide a lot of metrics but there are

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,180
also some other types of metrics but

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,160
communities about the governance that

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,630
the the history where the curves come

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,450
from where they want to how they manage

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,640
the contributors and this is to be

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,100
collected manually so we have tools and

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,160
forms once we have collected the metrics

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,430
we have to process them processing the

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,140
metrics means for putting them all in

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,630
the same format and normalizing them and

00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,940
then fitting this into some models

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,800
models that would produce some results

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,240
now here the issue is that the model

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,820
should not be black box there should be

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,920
absolutely understandable with by

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,810
end-users that's what we've done a

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,339
little bit with our this edge where we

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,860
are with publish we publishing their

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,420
models now another next stage once we

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,339
have the models and some results we have

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,320
to publish this results and publishing

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,480
results its other another another

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,790
challenge in fact because there are ways

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,890
to publish this the results are their

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,550
permission thematically well is it as

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,620
graphical do we feed this into

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,770
downstream systems these are some key

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,110
issues and again there's always feedback

00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:57,130
groups to complete the system and in

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:59,170
fact the the last stage is to share that

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,630
to communicate to reach out and to make

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:04,440
sure that we don't work on our own in

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:07,540
our ivory tower but that we share with

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,300
everyone and that we aligned with market

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,860
expectations so that's that's what we

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,180
want to do but doing this is very much

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,160
it seems simple like this the idea is

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,120
simple but then as we executing this and

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,230
we are about a year into developing this

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,630
we realized that there are lots of

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:31,329
questions it opens up avenues boulevards

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:33,430
and a lot of side streets and it's there

00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:35,290
are it raises questions the more you get

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,790
into it the more questions it raises for

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,649
instance some of the questions are the

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,180
metrics I just mentioned that you have a

00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,730
trade-off between what's possible and

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:45,370
what's available but then the project

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,529
support community for or for profit is

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,779
it one rationale fits all or do we have

00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,329
to do we need to have two differents

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:54,490
processing audio scales for for the

00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:57,100
project there is a different perspective

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,540
the business perspective is versus the

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,100
engineering perspective the engineering

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,540
perspective is the one that

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,970
is from the developers point of view

00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,769
where you'll consider the progress of

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,389
your project was the market but the

00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:09,430
business perspective is not that at all

00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:12,220
the business perspective is that from

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:16,180
the business manager who's used to deal

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,980
with mature business project and just

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,690
want to expect that so he says do we

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,399
have this or not so it's not at all the

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,920
same the same way the context is

00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,089
different sorry the scientific world and

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,250
there is a lot of applesauce in the

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:28,600
Surfing environment it's not exactly the

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,750
same doesn't behave doesn't expect the

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,149
same things as the business world

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:36,339
process I mentioned the data collectors

00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:38,500
with those reforms so we have automated

00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:42,310
collection of data or manual rate data

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,540
we have rational that is different so do

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:48,360
you want to measure something and

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:51,880
provide snapshots or do we have to

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:56,019
measure the evolution is it the changes

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:59,139
that we want to show do we - do we

00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:03,730
update the data we can update weekly

00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:06,040
monthly or second-by-second or or upon

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,889
events like each commit can trigger an

00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,970
update or build can be you can turn the

00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,550
trigger and update that's the sort of

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:15,639
things we still have to decide and then

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,860
representation to finish with this you

00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:21,430
have the the right representation is

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,410
probably good but little bit complex and

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,639
there's something we want to avoid we

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,410
don't want to create a hierarchy between

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,240
our projects because a project that is

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,579
in the beginning of the phase is just as

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,220
good as valuable as a project that is

00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:35,529
already an established project product

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,670
well supported and well recognized by

00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,500
the market so we don't want to create

00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:41,079
this kind of hierarchy and we still

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,350
struggling or deciding how we're going

00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:47,980
to show that the the starring stars is

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:50,050
maybe one way the the the temperature

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,269
thing is maybe another one so that's

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:56,259
just to share very quickly with you some

00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:59,439
what we do some of the questions the the

00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:03,100
metrics today we are measuring about to

00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:05,019
200 metrics yeah the number of data

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,759
points are at least 280 points we could

00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:08,529
have gone to 3 thousand data points we

00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:10,449
you have to keep this manageable so

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:12,670
again we can go wrong and those are the

00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:15,130
the challenges and as

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,290
often it's all about execution and the

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:21,339
devil is in the details so that's why we

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,230
need to collaborate with you and this is

00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,870
a process that is totally open there is

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,779
a web page there and we work on any kind

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:43,870
of contribution comment or feedback

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:48,880
thank you any questions yes what would

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:49,959
be a comparable assessment platform for

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,579
proprietary software

00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:56,740
oh this there are some projects very

00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:58,870
comparable project there's the the cows

00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,240
the Linux Foundation that's been doing

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,089
this in the framework of the core

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,490
infrastructure initiative there were

00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:09,420
many other projects there was a European

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:12,130
project called calico that aimed at

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,779
evaluating open source software there

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,560
was another project which we are

00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:18,940
leveraging which was called riscos not

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,149
very good name because it's supposed

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,680
that upwards of software is risky so

00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:28,870
it's not that it's it had some inputs

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,519
there are currently there is currently a

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,880
project a European project called cross

00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:38,160
miner who's developing technologies to

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,750
collect data and we collect data from

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,209
from the development tools but also from

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,010
mailing lists from comments do some

00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:46,360
sentiment analysis well this is

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,550
something that we try to automate in

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,589
that we gradually incorporate into our

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,260
understand hours sorry outside of open

00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:58,140
source pattern outside of the open

00:14:53,260 --> 00:15:01,660
source world like is there a successful

00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:04,690
come as a comparative platform for

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:07,060
proprietary software not that I'm aware

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,510
of but if you know if any I'd be happy

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,010
to look at them so why is why do we

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,260
particularly need such a platform for

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,060
open source rather than proprietary

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,890
soffit because there's plenty of you

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,839
know non open source applications which

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,810
have questionable quality origins and

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:27,360
support as well right

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,520
can you repeat the question yeah this is

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,350
only for open-source software right

00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,880
actually we started this for our own

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:40,050
codebase and we realized that it was a

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:43,170
topic that interested many people it's a

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:46,050
topic that also helps instill a little

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,340
bit of business awareness in the mind of

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,080
the developers so they have to

00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,480
understand that they may be the center

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,120
of the world but the world is big out

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,940
there and that they develop for end

00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,190
users that are confronted with offerings

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,630
from proprietary vendors so why is it

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,310
necessary to have platforms like this

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,650
only for open source and often all open

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,600
source products like why would a rating

00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,620
system for the thousands of proprietary

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,530
desktop or software-as-a-service

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,970
applications no necessary I'd say

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,530
because open source software is

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,530
developed in a way that is much more

00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,700
transparent and that at least for in our

00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,260
case we have access to our own

00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,440
infrastructure there's one thing I have

00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,730
to mention this data to w2 we've run our

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,370
independent infrastructure so we can

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,080
access to all the the the data we want

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,230
so for this we are totally sustainable

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,910
we're have no allegiance to any IT giant

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,770
or any economic power so we can carry on

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,710
analyzing or components another thing is

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,870
that there is more data available on

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,810
open source project than on proprietary

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,810
software it's true that I've been

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:51,450
approached by large companies who said

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,460
we could apply that to our own codebase

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,530
the same way you have open source and

00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,480
inner source you know so that has

00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:01,080
nothing to do with open source well here

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,870
they said we can follow your approach we

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:07,020
came to learn from what you discover and

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:09,300
now your maturation and maybe implement

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,260
something like that inside our own on

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,490
for own codebase and I think of big big

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,920
companies from tens of thousands of

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,410
people I mean and huge software

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:24,410
development I have another question

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:27,660
other other other question is first ok

00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:30,030
do you think that given that there are

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,520
not comparable platforms for proprietary

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:36,970
software that serve the same purpose do

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:39,210
you think that your platform

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,650
- could result in the perception that

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:46,059
these open-source applications are less

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:48,309
stable or trustworthy as a group which

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:50,350
is why there is a need for such an

00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,970
independent rating and assessment and

00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,260
analysis in the first place because if

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,580
you have one category of applications

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,830
which proprietary that do not have

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,090
independent ratings and assessments like

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,610
this and you have another group that do

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,740
then the implication could be that the

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,960
second group isn't more using greater

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,919
need why it's not because we're trying

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,200
to make them more transparent and give

00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,960
the end user information in order to

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,370
build trust in this operative software

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,909
that we acknowledge that this open

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:21,610
source way is not stressful it's not the

00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:24,070
case now no we think it's stressful but

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,539
we need to demonstrate it so it's like

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,090
we have we have support rate that is

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:33,280
mature and they have customers they have

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:35,110
end users they have distributed systems

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,020
integrators working on them consulting

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:40,929
all this and that is part of what some

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,070
of the people want they expect this on

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:43,809
top of everything that has been

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,490
discussed in this conference with regard

00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:47,860
to the quality of the code etc and the

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,570
compliance which is basic but then we

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,850
need to go a little bit once that that

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,590
ones have further to complete the the

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,320
whole process between the programmer and

00:18:53,590 --> 00:19:00,549
the average decision maker who rise to

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,620
the check I'll just keep going then so

00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:06,700
do you have some kind of buttons or

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:09,340
certification or visual signs of

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,770
accreditation for the for the projects

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,890
which you have assessed that could add

00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,850
value to those to those products I was

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,590
here working on the visual

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,690
representation of the project so as I

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,760
said it could be the radar thing and we

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,230
want to move away from this because it's

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,640
probably a bit too complicated and

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,650
that's why we want to develop this

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,750
synthetic indicator so that the average

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:31,600
decision-maker we say okay this is rated

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,539
7 or 8 it's good it's not it's bad I

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,299
don't want any 4 I want to go for for

00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:39,309
that level minimum and what does that

00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:41,710
implies that implies that I have

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:43,390
something that has all the other

00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,740
complements that is not just code but

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,860
it's something that can control for the

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,240
long term that's very interesting and in

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,460
order to

00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,160
be a member of your platform and to have

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,920
this assessment done membership fees are

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,100
paid by organizations if they exist in

00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,630
in order to cover the cost this is a how

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:05,560
so how it works no there's no business

00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:08,770
model there so if this is that we

00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,860
promote the codebase okay and we will

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,300
benefit if our project benefits so who

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:17,820
your members who you're paying members

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,820
in that case or who will they be

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:24,060
we're nonprofit organization we are

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:27,520
financed by membership so our members

00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:31,240
pay the fees that I guarantees our

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,000
independence and with this money we have

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,430
a new purchase governance the Board of

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,500
Directors and the technology can so by

00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,810
the way both are our instances of making

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,490
decisions and they decide and they

00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,560
approve this kind of project and decide

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,060
yes this is a good thing to do for the

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,140
good of our code base and our projects

00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:52,630
so it's open but instead of just doing

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,400
it just for ourselves the idea is to

00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:57,790
share it with everyone and make sure

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,320
that it's done in the open and gather as

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,240
much feedback from the market as

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,330
possible so if I wait long enough maybe

00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:10,840
you'll add my project without may have

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:12,640
independent Mufi no right now we don't

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,290
have the resources to apply this to all

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,070
the open source world okay so we

00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:21,340
concentrate on the project we can

00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:23,710
interact with which are the db2 project

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,440
actually we have projecting incubation

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,000
maturation mature and the archive we

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,090
concentrate on the mature project at the

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,590
moment and as you and at this stage we

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,440
need to interface with the project

00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:38,410
leaders because some of the data as up

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,670
to be gets where for instance if we look

00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:44,050
at some code quality data a unit test or

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:46,660
exist some time they're not very much

00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,430
accessible so we need to streamline this

00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,140
with the project leaders and then there

00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,910
are also all the type of information

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,280
with regard to the community the weather

00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,350
manage contributors as I mentioned the

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,720
type of software drop environment they

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,850
have beside beyond the the other between

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,140
for structure so this is to be

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,000
documented

00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,020
most of this information has to be

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,010
gathered on a form with the

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,010
collaborative live with a project leader

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,510
