Title: #FOSSBack 18: Shane Coughlan â€“ Complex Made Simple: Governance in Open Source
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Open source has always been about more than code. It is about how people work together and what they can accomplish as a community. Governance, or shared understanding of process and rules, became more important when open source scaled beyond small groups who knew each other well. Today we have a global community represented by many cultures using many languages. To accomplish this we have developed simple, understandable and effective governance structures. This talk will dive into the key principles that work for the real world.

hi there everyone it's a it's a great

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,820
pleasure to be here at Foss stage I was

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,970
talking to Paul and it's Bell in two

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,339
other organizers and saying it's hard to

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,220
believe this is the first time that Foss

00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:25,199
backstage has been held it feels more

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,849
like a conference that has been running

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,380
for a while the audience is diverse

00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:34,829
networking with each other the speakers

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,280
are interesting and represent a wide

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,730
range of views it's a conference that I

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,560
think out of the gate looks good sounds

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,470
good and I will certainly be telling

00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:52,590
people about it now my keynote today is

00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:55,710
about how we run open source not from a

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,320
development perspective not even from a

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,160
business perspective per se but rather

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,840
from the perspective of how do we manage

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,429
the collaboration in this type of

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,670
community I'm a political scientist so I

00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:14,609
look at issues like open source

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,310
community with a slightly different

00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:20,179
perspective to many of the people who

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,439
come from engineering or pure business

00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:28,560
backgrounds I'm interested in how do we

00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:32,459
take the complexity of human social

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,829
dynamics create a situation where

00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,200
parties who don't know each other and

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,530
have no natural reason to trust each

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,880
other can nevertheless collaborate on

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,969
technology for me open-source is

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,240
particularly interesting because it is a

00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:55,729
method of collaborating that we haven't

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:59,279
seen happen elsewhere as successfully

00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:01,709
open-source has provided a way for tens

00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:04,920
of thousands or perhaps even hundreds of

00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:07,139
thousands of individuals around the

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,500
world to collaborate on shared

00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:13,560
technology platforms with a relatively

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,530
high degree of confidence that what they

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,730
give and what they get is predictable

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,280
and fair

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:24,300
now this brings me to the topic of open

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,960
source governance open source compliance

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:32,740
ensuring that people follow the rules in

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,170
my view we're a long way from the point

00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,950
and open source where we were discussing

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:42,070
is this license valid or how do I

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,700
enforce this license or should I obey

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,430
the license we're in a situation with

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,400
open source for now people quite clearly

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:56,170
understand that we have a certain set of

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,470
rules codified in copyright that set a

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:03,490
tone that set a way of interacting that

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,190
allows us to build shared platforms this

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:10,060
is now a well-established and well

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,550
accepted fact for collaborators or

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,710
participants of all sizes from

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,940
individuals through to multinational

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:23,290
corporations we've seen the acceptance

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:26,320
of licenses using copyright law as the

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:31,180
correct and balanced way to ensure

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:34,120
fairness in open source the fact that we

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,840
now all agree that the licenses work and

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,340
we agree that we will follow them

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,370
doesn't mean that our challenges around

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,860
open source governance are over it means

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,739
that we have a good solid baseline a

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,280
great starting point but we still have

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,239
plenty of questions along the lines of

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,250
ok so now we know what the rules are and

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:02,170
we know where the rules are located in

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:05,580
the licenses do we in practical senses

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:09,580
implement these rules in different areas

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,620
for example I live in Japan and in Japan

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,010
there are large automotive companies

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,650
that are using open source and these

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:21,070
companies essentially have a model of

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:23,470
doing a lot of R&D then having their

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,960
suppliers build a lot of technology and

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:29,590
then the automotive company assembles

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,120
the technology so in in some ways and

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,270
this is a little bit frivolous

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,729
but also not inaccurate modern car

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,639
manufacturers our research and

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:43,180
integration experts with their supply

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,910
chain doing a lot of the building for

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,250
companies like this they look at the

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,169
supply chain they look at dozens or

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,070
hundreds of companies involved in

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:58,780
bringing a car to completion and they

00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:00,610
ask questions along the lines of ok so

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,860
people are following the license that's

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,650
great but how do we communicate that

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,260
through the supply chain how do we

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,870
ensure that each company while they're

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,300
doing the right thing can communicate

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,470
what they've done clearly to the

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,240
customers throughout the supply chain

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,650
those types of governance questions

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:27,580
quite frankly seemed burdensome or

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:30,300
difficult to resolve it took us quite a

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,729
few years of trying to work this out

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,940
before we settled on the simple idea

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:40,060
that maybe we can help everyone meet the

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,430
requirements by having standards and

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,930
those standards can be clearly and

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,710
predictably communicated to participants

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,080
for a while

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,419
every company was trying to do their own

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,930
thing they were recording their progress

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:58,479
in documents like spreadsheets they were

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,510
doing things like scanning code and

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,810
hoping that was enough to verify that

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:09,070
their development process had covered

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:11,169
all the bases when we began to think of

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,720
the problem differently when we began to

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:16,750
think how do we ensure multiple parties

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,599
multiple legal entities can communicate

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:23,260
the information with fidelity without

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:26,260
losing data without misunderstandings we

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,630
began to understand clearly that every

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,389
company putting things in a spreadsheet

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:35,500
and sending it onward was making stuff

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:37,750
harder more complex and less accurate we

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:42,280
turned our minds to building an industry

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:44,080
standard that would explain roughly what

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,950
the key requirements of a quality

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,730
open-source

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,900
Grahame must be and how you can meet

00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,630
those requirements

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,180
that's where open-chain came from it

00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:58,120
originated in a conversation between a

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,340
handful of lawyers and the conversation

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,360
was basically that the companies as

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:07,120
customers of large supply chains the

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,760
companies knew what they wanted from

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,130
open source but their suppliers didn't

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:17,680
necessarily have the processes in place

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:22,200
to deliver that so these lawyers sat

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,690
down and began to draft some universal

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,190
requirements for open source compliance

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,890
simple requirements like do you have an

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:32,380
inbound software process do you have a

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:36,610
development process do you have a policy

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:39,940
do you have an outbound process simple

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,820
questions that if you answer yes to by

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,670
and large your organization will be able

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:49,360
to manage open source licenses and of

00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,640
course you can answer this question if

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,810
you can manage the licenses you can

00:07:51,640 --> 00:08:00,640
trust what's going on the open chain

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:03,820
standard started a few years ago and has

00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,920
grown relatively quickly with very large

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,160
companies particularly in areas like

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,910
enterprise technology automotive and

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,350
consumer devices picking up on the idea

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,840
of having a shared approach to

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,990
governance to reduce complexity to

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:23,650
reduce investment required and to reduce

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:27,730
mistakes now this talk is entitled

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:34,690
complex made simple and the reason for

00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:37,420
that is that I believe in 2018 we have a

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,970
lot of talking points around open-source

00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:43,380
compliance and governance we have

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:46,060
certain issues like we've seen

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,750
enforcement in Germany that has caused

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,030
some disruption in our industry this has

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,840
been discussed by the Linux kernel and

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:59,020
netfilter teams in the past

00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,050
we've seen new participants entering

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,970
open-source entering software who are

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,210
learning from scratch about what to do

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:10,270
and we've seen some interesting not to

00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,370
say tensions but moments of evolution as

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:15,430
our community as a whole

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,270
changes and as all of this has been

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,940
going on

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:22,900
we've had some dialogues suggesting that

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:27,010
governance and open source is somehow

00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:31,000
lacking or somehow too complex or

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:36,690
somehow different from how we deal with

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,760
let's say proprietary software this

00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,450
perception of complexity is something

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,910
that has caused us to pause and

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,130
reconsider how we're doing things how do

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,130
we try to reduce the perception of

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:54,100
complexity to ensure that people using

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:58,840
open-source are confident how do we make

00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:01,570
things simpler not by reducing the

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,340
fidelity of something like governance or

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,840
the fidelity of compliance but by

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:11,110
pre-packaging as much of it as possible

00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:16,420
as my American colleagues Mike might say

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:18,460
pre chewing it as much as possible so

00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,930
we've been doing that I'm not sure if

00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,040
you're familiar with the Linux

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:26,320
foundations open compliance program

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,260
Linux Foundation has gradually started

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,410
to make a large stack of projects and

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:36,220
solutions to address governance and

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:38,590
compliance open chain as a overarching

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,140
standard is perhaps at the top of the

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:44,500
stack just below it there's another

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,960
standard called SPD X that explains how

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,330
you can describe what's in a package in

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,090
a consistent manner so that everyone can

00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,910
quickly read understand and also share

00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:57,660
their data below that there's projects

00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,400
like fossil adji for scanning code

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,790
outside of Linux foundation there are

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,940
also other interesting projects one new

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,279
project that started recently is

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,850
quartermaster

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,490
Mirko is right there he's running it

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:16,310
that's a CI CD project another project

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,199
that was recently released by a group of

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,449
people but particularly the Microsoft

00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:23,829
open source team is clearly defined

00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:26,360
which is a type of software catalog and

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:28,970
surrounding these various projects with

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,490
standards and tools we've got dozens and

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,550
dozens of publications that explain

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,850
what's going on how you can do it too

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,740
and how you can train and educate the

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:44,779
people in your organization using

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,670
open-source we're very close to making

00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:49,670
the complex question of open source

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:55,040
governance simple we're very close to

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:56,870
being able to say ok go here and you'll

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,610
be walked through the answers to your

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:04,399
questions I'd say that during 2018 you

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,459
can expect that capability to become

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,620
live right now I'm working on the open

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:11,870
compliance program website at Linux

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:16,339
Foundation with other members of the

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,839
team and admittedly we won't be

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:19,910
announcing the new website until

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,220
November but pre announcements never

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:26,899
hurt what we're looking at is having a

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:30,889
way to say are you a developer are you a

00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:33,139
company or are you a project and when

00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:36,230
you click through that you find all of

00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:38,449
the information available that can help

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,019
you frame your thinking and solve

00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:44,569
challenges related to governance

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:47,600
now I were an open chain which is one of

00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:49,790
many projects but I do think that if you

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,279
watch open chain you'll be able to keep

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,259
track of how we're making the complexity

00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:57,709
and governance a lot simpler

00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:59,480
there's our URL and the reason that open

00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:02,389
chain is a good place to keep track of

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,839
things is that we are only as standard

00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:08,149
and some reference material but we point

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,009
outwards to everything else and because

00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:11,809
we're on the top of the stack we're

00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,839
pointing out to all of the interesting

00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:16,880
projects around the place so hopefully

00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,279
we'll be playing an instrumental role in

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,320
tying things together and making

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:26,170
governance as

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:29,650
simple as possible now switching gears I

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:32,680
talked about how open-source governance

00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:35,410
is doing pretty well how we're making

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,510
standards how we're beginning to make it

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,060
easier to interact with your supply

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:43,990
chain and to interact with projects

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:46,090
around you at the same time as all of

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,960
this rosy news about everything going

00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:52,090
really well I think it's worth

00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,000
highlighting that sometimes we do face

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:57,550
interesting challenges I briefly

00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,890
mentioned the challenges in the German

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:05,350
legal jurisdiction with compliance cases

00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:09,010
in a challenging situation there was

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,990
that we saw a whole bunch of legal

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:14,410
claims against companies that did not

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,750
really seem to be motivated by ensuring

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,720
compliance but rather focused on a

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:22,120
profit motive and that caused some

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,140
concern disruption and uncertainty in

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:29,020
our community we also see challenges

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,820
coming in other areas I mentioned that

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,190
companies which have nothing to do with

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:36,010
open source or maybe nothing to do with

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:40,510
software in the past have begun adopting

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:42,520
open source technology just two months

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:46,230
ago I was talking to a very large

00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,240
company involved in consumer products

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,700
consumable consumer products and this

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,680
company never used open source in fact

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,640
it was focused on business-to-business

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,740
until recently and but their new product

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,690
range they're pivoting their business to

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,360
customer and their back end is all open

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:07,180
source in the case of this particular

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,150
company they took a very wise

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,770
well-informed and careful approach

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,810
whereby they actually looked at the

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,540
community carefully and then decided to

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,420
adopt the community norms projects and

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,270
methodologies to reduce their time to

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,390
market but there are other companies

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:28,300
which are new to open source who arrive

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:30,130
in a state of uncertainty

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,910
and without clarity of what they should

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:35,830
do and they naturally make mistakes

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:38,380
that's a slight concern for our

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,660
community because if we don't reach out

00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,960
and support these organizations if they

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:47,320
have a bad experience using open source

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:49,270
they might not continue and finally we

00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:54,280
have challenges because open source

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:56,980
itself is truly evolving becoming much

00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,080
larger than the individuals programming

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,980
code becoming much larger than any

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:07,450
company investing in it this change has

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,730
meant that to some extent the old method

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,670
of working with huge figure heads and

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:16,210
these inspirational inspirational figure

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,160
heads guiding the community is reducing

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,700
in favor of having much larger

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,100
communities with formal rule sets and

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,410
that that process of adjustment is not

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:31,740
always smooth and it does lead to some

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:34,690
tensions and these three things can lead

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,200
to serious concerns around governance

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:41,050
and predictability at the very beginning

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,930
of my talk I mentioned that open source

00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:47,230
is a method of interacting it's a method

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:50,980
of people working together and if we

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,960
have uncertainty if we have tensions if

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,960
it's about lawsuits or companies who

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:59,560
don't know what to do or the tension of

00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:02,580
communities evolving if the rules become

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,310
uncertain if the confidence and trust

00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,140
fostered by those rules become uncertain

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:13,060
we lose efficiency we lose the ability

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:16,030
to collaborate and that truly is one of

00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,070
my great concerns and one of the areas I

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:22,480
think we can make a great difference in

00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:25,240
governance the complexity of something

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,430
like lawsuits or the complexity of

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,250
teaching companies how to use open

00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:33,760
source or the complexity of managing

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:37,360
community transitions are something that

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,970
we are investing in right now rather

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,190
than neglecting this or waiting thing

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:45,370
things to hit a problem point we're

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,270
proactively investing in the projects

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:51,280
like open chain that are designed to

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:53,740
catch people give them a frame of

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,780
reference point them at solutions and

00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,390
allow them to look at the other

00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,309
organizations around them and feel

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:06,900
confident those organizations are doing

00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:10,510
the same thing to end my keynote I

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,799
perhaps would like to set the tone for

00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:16,510
the future free software open source if

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,340
there's one criticism that can be

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:23,890
leveled against it is that this area not

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:27,850
just in the last ten years perhaps since

00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:31,510
inception is quite inward looking we

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:34,809
tend to look in at what we regard as the

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:37,480
core of our community we tend to look at

00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:40,720
the technologies that perhaps we created

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,809
a very long time ago and still regard

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,400
them as central not from a perspective

00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:51,490
of utilitarian solution or benefit but

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,130
with a sort of emotional attachment this

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,820
inward looking nature means that our

00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:00,159
community can be so so close people can

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,809
arrive at an event and feel welcomed

00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:03,120
instantly as long as they know the

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,640
secret handshake

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,679
but this insular nature also presents us

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,780
with perhaps the greatest challenge to

00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:18,490
governance in open-source we are now

00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:24,039
software everything that his software

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:28,090
contains open-source but the reason

00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:32,140
open-source succeeded wasn't passion it

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:35,380
wasn't because of a normative good or

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,360
bad it was because it worked best it

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:41,289
solved more problems for more people

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,380
more efficiently and if we remain to

00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:47,440
inward-looking in open source if we

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:51,850
continually self-reference ourselves if

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,049
we continually hold various items for

00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,289
example not

00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:58,179
to pick a particular text editor but

00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:01,179
text editors which are decades old and

00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:04,029
regard them as Sacre sent simply because

00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:07,299
they exist if we get stuck inside

00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:10,629
ourselves we might miss the terrific

00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:13,269
opportunities of the future and by those

00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:15,279
opportunities I mean things like the

00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:18,039
massive advances coming in artificial

00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,350
intelligence the massive massive

00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:23,190
advantages and developments coming in

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:26,470
structure infrastructure automotive

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:31,899
areas that we are going to make a huge

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:33,460
impact as software but we perhaps need

00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:36,009
to be a little bit more open and

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:41,799
inclusive to make an impact as a

00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:45,220
community one thing I hope and I would

00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:51,309
like to put out to you as an idea today

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:54,220
is that in our community it might be a

00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:57,639
really good time for us to go back and

00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:00,249
think some of the ways that we've

00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:03,609
governed open source for decades are

00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:08,259
working well the fundamentals codified

00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:11,139
in licenses that's working well but some

00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:14,019
of the other aspects of the open source

00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:17,080
community the pre assumption that were

00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:20,169
dominated by individual hackers doing

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,659
amazing things or the pre assumptions

00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:25,299
dominated that a particular license type

00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:30,429
is inherently more advantageous than

00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:33,129
another these ideas might bear some

00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:35,049
reflection and perhaps adjustment we

00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:37,119
might benefit from new books talking

00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:40,629
about how the open source community

00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:43,859
today is so vibrant talking about why

00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:46,389
for example in China Baidu released

00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:50,129
autonomous car software as open-source

00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:52,840
last year things like that are

00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:54,730
incredible accomplishments they're

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,799
wonderful examples of how the

00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,259
open-source community is growing and

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,940
evolving

00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:02,930
we just need perhaps a little bit more

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,510
documentation about that

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:08,210
and given that you all have so much

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,310
experience I think my call to you would

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,230
be to consider being part of that you

00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:16,370
know blogging about what's happening

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:19,940
around our community today what's

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:24,710
happening in society and how open-source

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:26,780
fits into that so internally an

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,890
open-source are basic questions of

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:33,530
license compliance how to work together

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,060
we're doing fine and during this year in

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,990
particular you'll get some great

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:42,080
information about how projects companies

00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:44,750
and individuals can address open-source

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,020
top to bottom on the compliance and

00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,380
governance side pulling back on the

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:55,460
bigger picture of governance about

00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:57,440
community and society we might need to

00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,880
reflect a little bit about how things

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,740
have changed in the last 30 years and

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,010
where we might benefit from new essays

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:10,730
new books new inspirations to help

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:13,490
ensure that our community today supports

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:17,870
the outside community and brings them in

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:19,370
as best possible for tomorrow so thank

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:22,130
you very much for your time and your

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:24,170
attention I really appreciate it and I'm

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:27,290
around this event at any time if you

00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:29,510
have questions or comments and also now

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,930
I believe we have a minute or two for

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:35,990
questions so I did see my MC wife mildly

00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:39,370
waving a flag card yeah please

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,370
personally thank to Shane :

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:48,289
thank you and we still have a couple of

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,659
minutes maybe four questions since we

00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:53,120
have a delay of like five maximum - 10

00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:56,750
minutes - every session till the lunch

00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,279
so I'm coming for the question so we

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,279
have a question from this gentleman

00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:06,049
Shane first of all before I come up with

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,539
my question I really like to thank you

00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:11,539
what you're doing with open chain brings

00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:14,330
is some kind of delight of the end of a

00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:17,659
dark tunnel to us before this

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:21,649
initiatives for for us as a company

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:24,320
using open source was splitted in a part

00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:27,429
that is very transparent and that's the

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,460
code on the other side this legal part

00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:33,139
very on the dark side of even if we try

00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,850
to talk to other companies they say how

00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:38,269
we will not tell you how we handle this

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:41,120
and this is not the way all open-source

00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:44,539
should be so really thank you for this

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,029
initiative and now my question what is

00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:50,870
you wish how can we all support this

00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:53,179
initiatives to bring open-source make it

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,549
completely transparent on the code side

00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:59,629
and on the legal side so what can we all

00:24:55,549 --> 00:25:03,250
do it's a really good question and a

00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:05,179
valuable question sometimes we do face a

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:08,179
situation where people come to our

00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:12,759
community and they they say that that's

00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:15,289
great what do I do when it comes to

00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:18,830
improving governance contributing to the

00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:21,460
future of that joining something like

00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:24,250
the open chain mailing list and

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:28,490
contributing to discussions about future

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:31,070
specifications is useful but I think

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:34,429
more generally to help the community at

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:37,340
large getting case studies or getting

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:39,909
contributions of reference policies or

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:43,389
just reference process outlines is

00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:46,519
something that we see immediately

00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:48,889
impacting people so when open chain

00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:50,570
started we were focused on the idea of

00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:51,920
let's make this standard the

00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:54,980
specification

00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,190
and to support it we made some training

00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,930
slides reference training slides and we

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,360
thought these slides would be used to

00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:04,130
help meet the specification but as soon

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,680
as we put them out there the slides just

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,480
went everywhere all over the world some

00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,160
people were using it for open-chain a

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,750
lot of people were using it for other

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,400
things they were revamping their

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:17,360
internal training programs they were

00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:21,440
sending them to their suppliers there is

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:25,040
huge demand in the global open source

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,420
space for case studies and examples so

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,690
that's where you can make the biggest

00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:32,810
impact and what's interesting is that no

00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:35,300
matter what that example is it will be

00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:38,570
useful so if a developer makes a quick

00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:41,450
note about how they let's say contribute

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:43,610
to a project that is useful it's

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:46,730
immensely useful and in some countries

00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:48,830
like Korea many companies until recently

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,800
wouldn't allow their developers to even

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,830
access services like github those were

00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,810
blocked so now they're unblocking that

00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:59,060
but the developers are really just

00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,770
getting up to speed they're desperate

00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,260
for material to see how they can do

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,380
things properly if you go to open chain

00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,150
project and just join our mailing list

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:11,210
you can send in reference material at

00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:14,870
any time we are also releasing templates

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:17,810
for one page or one presentation slide

00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:21,620
case studies these case studies are just

00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:24,320
crazy useful they're useful as reference

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,210
for actual processes but we also found

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,370
they're really useful to go and talk to

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,950
management which has been one of the

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:34,280
very important things automotive

00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,930
probably leads the way yesterday Toyota

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,970
was running an open chain event in

00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,670
Nagoya and they announced three

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:44,300
automotive case studies which are now on

00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:46,070
the open chain website and we we know

00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,190
that there's another automotive case

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:52,040
study coming out today which is actually

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,020
going to be rather than an anonymous

00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,220
case study it will be a named toyota

00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:59,510
case study and those going out

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,960
immediately get attention and

00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:05,090
immediately get pickup I don't want to

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,929
go on too long on this point but I would

00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:09,080
like to talk about

00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:11,240
just the license related to this when it

00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:15,529
came to licensing the material in open

00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:18,710
chain we put the specification under a

00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:20,749
CC license which was relatively

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,659
restricted so that the standard would be

00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:25,580
very stable but we put all of our

00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:29,200
reference material all of our training

00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:32,059
material everything else under CC zero

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,769
effectively public domain and that was

00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:35,929
critical I think in allowing people to

00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:37,730
adopt it because they could include it

00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:39,679
in their own company material or their

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,899
project material they don't even need to

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:46,159
mention where it comes from and that

00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:48,550
that really worked so thank you for

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:54,910
Shane Coughlin again thank you

00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:54,910
