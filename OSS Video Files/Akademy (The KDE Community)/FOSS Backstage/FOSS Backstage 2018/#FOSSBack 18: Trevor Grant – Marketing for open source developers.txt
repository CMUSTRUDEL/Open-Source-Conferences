Title: #FOSSBack 18: Trevor Grant – Marketing for open source developers
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Trevor Grant talking about "The Perils of Building Better Mousetraps (or Marketing for Open Source Developers)"

Most developers (any developers) have little to no exposure to the world of marketing.  In Open Source project, developers are doing this for fun and on their own time- which usually means they want to write code and make cool new features. But why are you building this cool amazing software, if no one is going to use it? Marketing can be tedious but it really is essential for both increasing user adoption of a project and recruiting new devs to help work on the project.

The Big Data Apache projects of the late 2000s-early 2010s (e.g. Hadoop and Spark) were wildly popular- however they both solved a very painful business problem AND had professional marketing departments behind them. For most smaller projects, this falls back on developers and other community members.  

In this talk we’ll discuss, the “path users/developers take to find your project”, the open source “purchase funnel” (getting someone to become aware, interested in, trying out, and becoming a contributor to your project), tactical considerations such as SEO, Google Adwords, Twitter campaigns, overall cohesive messaging, and more- all through a case study around Apache Mahout which after becoming extremely popular in the early 2010’s, fell out of popularity (a victim of professional marketing from other projects, among other things), refactored, and now has a unique problem of being a well known name in Big Data, but known for something it no longer does (run on Hadoop).

how y'all doing today my name is trevor

00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,580
grants and i will be giving this talk

00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,070
this is the talk about the better

00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:17,510
mousetraps and marketing on open source

00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:20,630
projects a little about me I'm a PMC of

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:24,470
Apache mahute and Apache streams an open

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:27,199
source evangelist at IBM and I am I've

00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:31,699
got my masters of applied mathematics an

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:36,920
MBA in a website and a Twitter handle

00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:41,140
and I'm also available at Apache org so

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,580
please reach out a little bit about

00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,210
mahute so the way the flow of this

00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:51,500
project is we're going to this is maybe

00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,850
a case study of going through this

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,070
marketing and mahute said some really

00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,940
interesting and different problems then

00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:01,010
a lot of projects have in the case of

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,050
mahute we've got a really high brand

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,519
recognition

00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,789
unfortunately that brand recognition is

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,549
for something that we don't do anymore

00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:13,070
so this is we're recognized for the

00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:15,109
wrong things when people do a search for

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,350
Mahmood they're finding blog posts for

00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:19,759
what we used to do

00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,460
originally it was a leucine sub-project

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,979
it became a top-level project in 2010 it

00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,100
was machine learning for MapReduce and

00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:31,819
Hadoop that was the the famous mahute

00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:36,049
that everyone hears about then there was

00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:38,810
the rise of spark ml and the Lib and the

00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:41,509
old graphs on how much faster machine

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:49,240
learning runs on spark were implicitly

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:51,159
running against mahute now my dancing no

00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,939
there we go

00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,249
there's three kind of open source

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:57,409
projects in general you're either on

00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,909
your open source project either no one

00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,979
knows about your project and you wish

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,289
they would find out about it

00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,130
everyone misunderstands your project

00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,920
they've heard of it but they don't

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,060
really understand what it does or

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,740
everyone knows your project and they

00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,290
want to be a committer on it and a

00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,150
contributor and if that's the real big

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,930
problem you're having Holdings given a

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:23,530
talk right next door on exactly that but

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:27,159
the first two people here we are now I

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:29,409
said I used to I know I didn't mention

00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,810
all my about me my first job I was a

00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:33,549
data scientist at a media strategy firm

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,639
it's called this company called mine

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:39,670
share part of WP PE which is a really

00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:42,459
big media company now I'm assuming that

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:46,120
everyone in this audience is a developer

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:49,480
not an adman just because that's what

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,930
conference we're at but marketing's for

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,159
everyone

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,169
you started working on your open source

00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,489
project because you wanted to write some

00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:58,239
code about something you really cared

00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:00,700
about and the problem is you want people

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,159
to use your project and the problem

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,790
there is people need to find out about

00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,169
it and the marketing teams aren't doing

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,620
open source they have their own

00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:16,450
philanthropic pursuits that they follow

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:18,549
so you're the marketing team you signed

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,109
up to write some free code but someone's

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,239
got to market it and it's gonna have to

00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:25,569
be you or people on your project the

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,190
exception is there's two either you

00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,359
don't mark it and nobody uses your

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,590
project and you're ok with that because

00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,569
you really really just wanted to write

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,609
the software or the second exception is

00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:35,650
you start a company with your project

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,989
you get some VC money you pay a

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,340
marketing team and that works too and I

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:41,019
have no problem with people taking

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,040
advantage of the VC Vampires if you want

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:48,099
to do that go nuts but assuming you're

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,509
gonna be doing your own marketing I'm

00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,430
gonna present something called a

00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:54,489
marketing funnel this is a pretty

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,909
standard business one-on-one idea that

00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,259
applies to any project or product

00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:01,720
open-source software included you've an

00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,849
awareness a bunch of where people are

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,340
aware of your product first then they

00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:09,430
become they consider using your project

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,009
then they maybe use it once or they try

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,109
it out then they become a regular user

00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:15,699
and then they become like a product

00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:19,389
champion someone who really cares about

00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:21,669
your product as an example of this would

00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:25,870
you please raise your hand if you've

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:27,430
heard of Apache mahute before today ok

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,320
everyone raise your hand then cuz you

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,879
heard of Apache Mahmood now so everybody

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,699
start to keep your hands up then

00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:37,149
if you have ever considered using Apache

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:40,929
mahute keep your hands up if you've ever

00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:42,459
downloaded and tried my boot once ok

00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:44,110
we're getting a little weaker and keep

00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:46,089
them up if you were a regular user you

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,740
built anything around the hoot so at

00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:51,369
this point the funnel has now gone to 0

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,740
unfortunately but that's the idea and

00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:55,209
any open source project is really going

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,039
to follow that and then past user a

00:04:55,209 --> 00:05:00,189
person who regularly uses the product

00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,770
you have a contributor and so we want to

00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:04,509
get more contributors usually or maybe

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,339
we're just trying to get users but we

00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,469
need to set those goals and so this

00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:11,110
story is gonna be about the challenges

00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:13,209
Macoutes had and going through this

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,169
funnel and rebuilding things because we

00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:19,149
do not do MapReduce anymore and when I

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,039
introduce myself and I say you know I'll

00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:22,269
be in an interview or people asked oh

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,279
you have an experience doing you know

00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:26,589
machine learning with big data and I'm

00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:29,379
like actually I'm a PMC on Apache mahute

00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,539
and they're like oh best case they will

00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,830
say I've never heard of Apache moving

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,139
I'm like great we start from Ground Zero

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,379
and I can start telling you about it but

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:41,319
normally what I get is do people still

00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,749
do learning on MapReduce I don't use

00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,979
MapReduce anymore

00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:47,819
did you know machine learning is a lot

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:50,379
faster on smart than on MapReduce and

00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:55,959
isn't mahute dead which is always my

00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:57,519
favorite we don't do yeah we we run on

00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,649
spark now we run on spark we run off

00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,279
lots of engines so we always end up

00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:04,449
havin to have that conversation of an

00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,439
it's so instead of just telling them

00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:09,369
what the project does we have to

00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,209
dismantle all these old ideas it is what

00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,550
it is

00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:16,509
so we're trying to evangelize and

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,219
rebrand and this is about opening up

00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,719
that top level that awareness we want to

00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:22,659
people now we need to make people aware

00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:23,709
not only of mahute which a lot of people

00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:25,209
already are but we need to make them

00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:29,829
aware that we've changed what we're

00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:33,669
doing we did a really really big push on

00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:34,829
this fall of 2016 spring 2017 it's sort

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:38,829
of petered out and we'll talk about that

00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:40,629
slightly along the way but um yeah a lot

00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:43,710
of conference talks a lot of evangelism

00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:47,430
in developer circles

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:50,370
blog posts and conference talks or how

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,870
people hear about things I feel like I'm

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,759
literally preaching to the choir here

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,850
because you're all at a conference

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,930
learning about new things and Berlin

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,610
buzzwords was right before we did we

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,110
petered out as we went to the fall in

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:09,840
spring of 2018 still hit a couple and

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,759
then blog posts again pushing those out

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,830
via Twitter but just trying to make

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,660
people aware that our project is still

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:21,180
around it's not dead and it's changed so

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,310
we were and we started gaining traction

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,220
this was a really exciting part you know

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:29,460
we start off I was hearing a lot more

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,740
isn't mahute dead in 2016 in early 2017

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,360
then I have recently which is nice I

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,789
mean usually either getting I've never

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,509
heard of it or they have heard of it and

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:41,099
they know what it is and that's great

00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:42,660
PMC's and people on the project can

00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:44,039
always write blog posts and we obviously

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,830
care a lot about it so we'll write

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,229
getting outs new users to come in and

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,210
contribute write blog posts feels a lot

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:52,560
better because that means someone's

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,000
using the product everyone wants to feel

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,380
like your products being used these

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,820
people are not only using it but they're

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,240
using it enough that they care to write

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,280
a blog post so when I I give a very

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,800
similar talk to this at Apache Con in

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,419
Miami last year and there was about 10

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,550
blog posts that had come out in the last

00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:12,000
6 months that were about hoop format

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,770
reproduce I'm like well great I was

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,320
updating the slides I can only find one

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,580
from the last year so that's good that's

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,930
progress we're moving in the right

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,280
direction

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:25,139
also the I'd like to call out the Oh top

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,500
skills they'd assign tests need to learn

00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,509
in 2018 Apache moot was number two and

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,979
it was by this was according to the guy

00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:35,400
who wrote neo4j which is a big graph

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:36,900
database soho i don't know if he was

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,610
talking about the Numa moot I'm going to

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,870
assume he was it wasn't explicitly

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:45,450
stated and so that felt really nice a

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:49,279
very non-scientific non data based graph

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,390
that you can use is the Purple Line is

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,570
the amount of effort of people working

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,750
on the project over the last well year

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,760
and a half two years

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,520
the effect of all that work is the blue

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,200
line there's a lag this is also can be

00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,400
demoralizing when you're working and

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,130
working and working it may be putting

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,510
like 20 hours your free time in on this

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,510
project and it just doesn't feel like

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,070
anything starting to stick then you know

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,240
maybe you take a little breather and you

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,520
come back and look at it a few months

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,230
later and like oh yeah there's blog post

00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,210
people are starting to use it all that

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,700
work I did is starting to pay off and

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:27,050
you get maybe that um revitalization you

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,240
get excited about it again so that uh

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,950
the the major points there was a

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,970
Zeppelin integration I don't know not

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,220
sure if we have a lot of math or

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,710
necessarily Apache people it was a cool

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,630
thing we'll breeze by in a little bit we

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:43,190
did a big release in 2017

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,360
now well we'll talk about that too there

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,710
was a little there's a little asterisk

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,090
on that one we came up with a new

00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:53,390
website but for a couple reasons

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:55,010
we died off on our efforts but like said

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,330
when I was looking at this and starting

00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,640
to do my research to kind of update

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:03,050
these slides I realized hey we've had

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,700
some really good bounce back now another

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,370
way to do that maybe instead of like

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,170
looking at it once a year is using

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,510
analytics this is kind of going back to

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,310
business nerd stuff but you want to do

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,839
analytics on your project so you can you

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,720
know kind of take the pulse of how

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,850
popular things are are people using it

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,260
Apache has an internal tool that lets

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,110
you see the number of downloads off the

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,960
official mirror this is Google Analytics

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,930
on the left that gives you lots of

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,550
interesting analytics about your website

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,650
Twitter analytics so all these tools

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,570
that you should be using to pump up your

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,670
project in the first place usually have

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,700
some sort of free analytics package to

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,170
them and the key is just use it just use

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,790
it and look at it every once a week or

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,589
once a month or anytime you're feeling

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,620
bad like no one uses your project and

00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:51,620
you'll be like no we have about 500

00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,600
users a day at well on weekdays we go

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,740
drop down to maybe 250 on the weekends

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,540
that you know we can see how are people

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,120
getting to our site organic search from

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,350
social media channels it's a fun way to

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,250
kill some time when you feel like doing

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,550
some project stuff but you don't

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,690
necessarily want to code arguably we

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,570
could write all this ourselves because

00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,130
we're a machine learning project but

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,970
Google versions so nice and easy and

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:18,790
pretty charts so it is what it is

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,100
so the evangelism evangelism was our

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,530
solution to increasing the awareness we

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,410
want more people to know about mahute

00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,510
because as we were talking about earlier

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,500
no one's gonna download the project if

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,050
they've never heard of it

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,490
that's or no one's gonna consider using

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,890
it if they never heard of it you need to

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,020
the first step in broadening out this

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:42,100
marketing funnel is making people aware

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:44,020
of your project now the next step was so

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,400
people have heard of mahute this was

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,110
something that was killing us all

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,920
through the big evangelism push of the

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,390
20 early 2017 was that we were getting

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,670
people excited about our project and

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:57,970
they were going and seeing our old

00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,130
website built in 2014

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,500
right before we shifted away from Map

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,780
Reduce you can see at the top bar that

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,360
two of the three like drop-down menus

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,400
are about Map Reduce so now that people

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,620
just heard this big talk about mahute

00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,150
isn't about MapReduce anymore and they

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,320
google it on their phones and like it

00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,300
looks like it's still about Map Reduce

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,660
though just just but just looking at the

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,760
website it is what it is

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,760
there's also Wikipedia pages didn't like

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,750
need to be updated so getting a new

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,390
website was a really big push for us we

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:34,000
were originally we were running on the

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:36,730
old Apache content management system a

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,680
problem with that is only committers can

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,880
update the website we had people doing

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,370
drive-bys all the time like hey I

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,090
noticed a link is out of date here's the

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,380
correct link

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:49,030
I noticed a typo on this page website

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,470
fixes because you know people you know

00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,120
maybe their interest in the project and

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,170
maybe they just want to do a little help

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,420
but website fixes are great newbie

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,360
issues if you know a lot of people don't

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,070
have experience doing pull requests to

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,990
an open source project and they don't

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,410
feel like they're smart enough experts

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,780
to maybe critique your stochastic

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,600
singular value decomposition algorithm

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,580
but that's definitely a typo and they're

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,590
very sure that it's a typo and they can

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,750
make a little PR in a book in a pull

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,240
request and it's a great way to bring

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,010
people in we've got I think three PRS

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,540
sitting out right now that are

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,650
just that and that's yeah it's a great

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,850
way to get people interacting with the

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:31,570
community make them feel like they're

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,760
part so that was one of the main reasons

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,040
we decided to it the other was when

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,610
people contribute new algorithms we

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,590
wanted documentation to be a requirement

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,540
of the contribution you can't just drive

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,120
by and drop off some cool new math

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,940
algorithm with no explanation of what it

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,390
does how it does why it does it and when

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:55,170
the website is in with the code the same

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,370
whole request must have a updated a

00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,530
documentation page or if you added a

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:03,160
feature to an algorithm it updates the

00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:07,840
documentation along with it um so the

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,580
new image website's easy to make mmm but

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,860
very tough to design especially for a

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,830
bunch of math and distributed

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,180
engineering nerds we had seen a couple

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,040
other sites that were using jekyll

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:22,480
bootstrap we decided we wanted to use

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,880
jekyll bootstrap too but there was a

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,970
couple like really bad implementations

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,720
we finally had uh we got ahold of a guy

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,650
named david miller

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,510
start bootstrap comm he does Jekyll

00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,520
websites for a living we're like we need

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,690
help we can maintain this thing you

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,970
don't have to do any work we just need

00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,670
like a basic design pattern he makes

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,170
themes and skins and things and so he

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,970
did he helped us out and made this

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,160
really really beautiful theme if you go

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,440
online the the lines at the bottom they

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,180
wave so that's always I don't know what

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,310
see I thought it was fun

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,440
it's got like a news section it's got

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,960
tweets it's it's a very very nice site

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,460
now one that doesn't say MapReduce all

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,900
over it so we have a little bit more

00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:07,480
credence when we say Moe hoots not about

00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:08,770
MapReduce yeah so the other thing you

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,600
will notice that there's this new logo

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:14,470
down in the right corner hand corner of

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,240
all these slides we add a bike shed

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,030
argument about redesigning an old logo

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,950
we knew that we everyone agreed everyone

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:24,190
in the community agreed we needed a new

00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,480
logo the old mahute is someone who

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,780
drives an elephant it's a Sanskrit word

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,880
and since the project was machine

00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,680
learning on MapReduce and MapReduce has

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,090
the Hadoop elephant it made sense to

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,800
have like the mahute driving the

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,990
elephant but this was very

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,080
counterintuitive to our story about

00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,700
we're not about MapReduce anymore so we

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,080
had a big argument and everyone had

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,740
their two cents on what they thought the

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,029
logo should be and the designer so this

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,250
is another little trick on how you can

00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:53,410
sometimes just flank it and so if

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,350
everybody agrees it needs to change the

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:59,020
designers like look man I need something

00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,870
that the yellow and blue don't go with

00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,970
the color scheme I need some new logo I

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,560
don't care what I just need something to

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,120
make this work with the website we're

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,290
like we had a big fight about it it took

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,480
like three months and nobody decided

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,120
anything we like submitted requests we

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,649
had a 99 designs campaign didn't we

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,149
couldn't we are unable to make a

00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:17,890
decision on a new campaign all we know

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:20,410
is we need a new one just make something

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:24,670
up and he's like okay so he made that up

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,839
that was a placeholder out logo I so if

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,850
you've been up for the Apache lounge

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,940
you'll see that all the logos are on

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,890
banner now that's an older banner and it

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,950
still has the old mahute logo but I was

00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:38,290
at go to Chicago a couple of months ago

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,029
and there's a new band it was a brand

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,550
new banner that I'd been shipped to set

00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:44,410
up at the thing and somehow and I'm not

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,650
really sure how but the new logo got

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,520
picked up and was put on the banner so

00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:52,350
apparently that's our new logo and

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,670
that's how these things work sometimes

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:59,680
but yeah thank you David Miller for the

00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:01,570
logo and the website okay so now people

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,550
have heard of our project and they've

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:07,089
googled it great we got onto the website

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,170
now we want to have a useful product I'm

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,260
not going to make this a whole talk

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,730
about my boot but I will say we've got

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,610
some killer new features that we've

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,020
released recently GPU integration if you

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,480
follow anything about machine learning

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,470
AI everyone wants GPU integration so we

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,510
have that an algorithm framework Zepplin

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,429
will go through these these increase the

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,290
fact you have good features increases

00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,210
the consideration you have the features

00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,500
people want in a piece of software now

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,570
they've they're aware of the software

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,610
they've checked it out the features that

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,910
they want exists in the software

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:41,760
great now getting people to download the

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,840
software

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,140
zeppelins kind of like jupiter notebooks

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,630
um and we came up with an integration

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,280
and there was an issue with the

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,500
integration just a little tiny one

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,600
there was a version mismatch between the

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,000
spark version that Zeppelin ships and

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,740
what mahute had precompiled now we did

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,760
that release of 30 no last year and

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,620
we're like alright cool

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,970
but we need to bump that up to a newer

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,980
version of spark a new version of Scala

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,720
we'll just do that real quick two weeks

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,770
well turnaround we did a release we're

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,110
gonna do another release two weeks later

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:14,250
with just a quick version bump that's

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:19,630
what we thought was gonna happen um in

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:22,450
reality there were some issues one of

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,740
our dependencies was version locks um so

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,250
that was fun

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,690
and that caused build issues an SBT

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,090
which is the Scala build tool if you're

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,690
familiar with that rich eventually led

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:37,330
to a lot of fighting and name-calling on

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,800
slack and the mailing lists being in an

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,090
open source project is like being in a

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:45,790
family you fight whenever you have time

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:47,320
so in oh and George des met is giving a

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,850
talk on this next door so if you wanna

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,250
hear more about settling those projects

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:55,840
or problems I'll be in there but we

00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:00,940
everyone blamed everyone else it was a

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,860
it was a thing finally about two weeks

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,620
ago who's dieded we didn't II do some

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,750
pom cleaning um there was a lot of old

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,180
MapReduce stuff it was an entire project

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,980
that totally pivoted its direction when

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,450
it did so it was done quick the

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,350
MapReduce stuffs was still kind of

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,520
supported but not really I've been a PMC

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,710
I think for a year and a half in a

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,490
committer for a little over two years

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:27,700
maybe right around two years um there

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:29,710
were like half the project was old dark

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,270
magic that no one currently on the

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,890
project no one goes in there that's

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,420
that's that's all magic and we don't we

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,250
don't know what it does we don't want to

00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,580
break it so we don't touch it I'm like

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:43,210
okay well started going through and

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,120
trying to clean these things um the

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,500
trick was Java programmers anyone anyone

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,470
no no Java

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,030
really okay well Java has something

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,940
called palms and we deleted all the

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:58,000
palms and like they were these massive

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,440
like you know 2500 line documents of

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,050
just dependencies and this is and that's

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,640
and build tools and plugins and whatever

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:06,170
the lead-up name them got back up and

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,150
start rebuilding a pompous file from

00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,310
scratch started merging modules back

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,930
together and cleaning out like all this

00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,420
old junk

00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,130
because sometimes code is like in

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,080
appendix and it had a really useful

00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,330
function at one point but it's been so

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,390
long ago nobody remembers what it is and

00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:25,520
so we did a lot of appendectomies there

00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,040
were three logging frameworks and for

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,650
unit testing frameworks in the project

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,490
so now I didn't get rid of them all but

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:36,050
we have very clear JIRA issues like get

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,460
cut this down to one we only need one

00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,690
testing framework we don't need to like

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,430
in the same module they'll have like

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,110
three of them because someone wrote one

00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,250
function and then someone wrote another

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,720
function didn't understand the other

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,410
testing framework like I'll just use

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,120
this one I know

00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:53,240
great so getting all that wrapped around

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,800
okay we finally got it the point being

00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,600
is before they can download you need at

00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,680
the features you need to have a project

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,940
that people can understand this is

00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,120
another feature but it's a more

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,890
important one if we think of all the

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,170
people in the world who understand

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,690
distributed engines like spark and flink

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:14,210
and just distributed engines in general

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,160
this is a that's a small set now if you

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,990
think of the people in the world who

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,730
understand advanced mathematics and like

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,710
stochastic or you know singular value

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,490
decomposition x' and k-means and like

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,830
how to actually write these out

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,330
algorithms this is also a small set and

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:31,100
if we get the overlap between the two

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:33,590
groups this is a very small set so Scala

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,750
has this thing where you can write a

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,670
domain-specific language and one of the

00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,020
early things would have done was make a

00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,730
mathematically expressive

00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,620
domain-specific language and a way to

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:46,150
think of that is like it's like are you

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:48,800
can write these lines that look like

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,800
math they look it looks more mathy than

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,420
like your regular Java you know a dot

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,590
transpose and then the name of the next

00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:59,930
whatever you're trying to do this looks

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:03,400
like our which mathematicians use quite

00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:06,170
a lot it also looks like MATLAB kind of

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,240
so this was good though because we want

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,400
more people to contribute algorithms we

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,900
now have opened that up to all there are

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,250
a lot more people who are qualified

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,500
because they don't need to be Scala

00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,670
experts or Java experts you just need it

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,150
more or less know your way around our

00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:22,400
and we can kind of help you out

00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:25,760
also possibly putting tensorflow on the

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,250
back end yeah because everyone loves

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,929
sensor fall actually the sensor fall is

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,710
a great example of this tensor flow if

00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:35,000
you've used it

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:36,380
I hate Google's Python Python supposed

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,240
to be very expressive language you can

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,960
just read they somehow make it like very

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,820
ugly and not type safe Java it they

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,610
destroy everything that was nice about

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,410
Python and then they that's and that's

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,540
what they ship so at least you can write

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,120
mathematically expressive tensorflow if

00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,830
we get these bindings set up okay now

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,780
we've worked our way down the funnel a

00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:00,950
little bit people can download things oh

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,290
and we've we've increased our user base

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:06,350
in our contributor base a little bit now

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,400
the engine neutrality because the whole

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:16,549
idea is we can have different back-end

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:17,750
engines this also jokes this is

00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:19,970
important because there are some big

00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,419
companies that will not declare that

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,650
they're using mahute but they are and

00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:27,530
this engine your travel T is a big deal

00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:30,830
for them because if you are proprietary

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:32,000
company X and you want everyone to use

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,070
you know your special high-speed

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,210
database which is probably just a

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,100
wrapper around another open source

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,340
database but you've made an appliance

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,570
out of it so it's whatever but you don't

00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,710
want to write an entirely new machine

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,530
learning framework from the ground up

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,780
you can just take my boot and shimmy

00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:51,740
shimmy and write some bindings and tada

00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:54,110
you're done but that also increases our

00:23:51,740 --> 00:24:00,169
users the algorithm framework we talked

00:23:54,110 --> 00:24:03,320
about it also makes this easy to for

00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:06,410
people who are doing a pull review when

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,850
you're doing your maintaining a machine

00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,320
learning project you not only have to

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,299
have people who understand them the code

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,100
and like what Scala is doing but also

00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,840
that like the mathematics that are being

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,610
laid down are doing the right thing that

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,980
this person is correctly defined this

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,390
function in this language when you have

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,650
a mathematically expressive DSL that

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,570
also makes it easy to like not only

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,220
contribute but or if that person just

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,419
decides they're going to take off they

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,909
don't care anymore about the project

00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:31,220
it's whatever people who come by later

00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:31,460
can still read those algorithms and know

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,360
what

00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,650
saying we made a template to make it

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,120
easier for people to drag-and-drop

00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:42,680
algorithms into our framework

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,510
encouraging everyone to use dev the dev

00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,440
lists this is an Apache specific thing

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,150
surprisingly hard sometimes for people

00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,610
to like figure out how to use a mailing

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,470
list there you just send an email and

00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,450
subscribe and whatever but the guy who

00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,130
was helping us out the website I think

00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,280
it took a while to get him actually on

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,580
the mailing list but or he was being

00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,350
quiet it could have been either way but

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,540
you know doing that hand-holding with

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,510
people who are new committers is another

00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:16,640
important thing and contributors and so

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:18,770
this is the our marketing funnel but now

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:23,300
much much much bigger because of all the

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:25,820
steps we've been taking now how this

00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,340
actually progressed I think we did the

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:31,100
math DSL first and then we had that big

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,810
spike in 2016 or 2017 you don't have to

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,300
necessarily do it first the way you

00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,590
ideally should do it well not even

00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,690
necessarily because if you make a bunch

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,150
of people aware of your thing but then

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,770
your products not ready all you're doing

00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,240
is setting up trouble for yourself later

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:47,840
on down the road because they think your

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,920
product doesn't work but the things to

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,860
think about when you're trying to market

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:54,620
your open source project then our

00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:57,350
awareness consideration casual user user

00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:01,310
and then like products you know champion

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,870
or an evangelist or contributor so

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,310
what's next we're working on our

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:09,740
algorithms framework we're working our

00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:12,380
GPUs there's a big number of things more

00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,950
engine bindings getting over the version

00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,510
lock that is just about done

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:20,420
we're also talking about maybe excepting

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:23,270
mahute our MapReduce pr's again

00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:26,150
that was a it's we're talking about it

00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:27,440
it was a thing that um we stopped when

00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,580
we deprecated the MapReduce we wanted

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,070
people be like no we're not doing

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,720
MapReduce anymore but it's been three

00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,950
years people are now starting to write

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,960
blog post and understand we don't do

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,790
that and there are still some MapReduce

00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,350
users and there are there's a couple

00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,730
bugs there's a couple PRS they didn't

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,310
get their PR and done in time for

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,230
whatever the cutoff date and if people

00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,030
want to do that that's fine we don't

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,070
necessarily we're not MapReduce experts

00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,450
but if we can find someone who can

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,330
review it and say yeah this looks pretty

00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:57,500
legit then that's an idea we're opening

00:26:53,330 --> 00:27:01,220
back up the conclusion then is some

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:04,669
doing yeah we're doing okay on time we

00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:08,179
did a big transportation and we want

00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:11,360
people to be aware that we did this big

00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:15,110
transformation um but I guess for the

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,450
point of this crowd it's that even if

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,530
you have everybody knows about your

00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,730
project but they know about it the wrong

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,320
thing that's fine it doesn't mean like

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,450
all is lost or you have to scrap the

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,880
project arguably maybe we should have

00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:29,510
scrapped it and made a new project but

00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,850
we didn't and I think that's okay now we

00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,200
still have you you can ride that old

00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:37,040
brand recognition out and you can do

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,419
something good with it means always help

00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,100
talks you should always use memes in

00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:44,330
your talks and try to get people to

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:45,590
giggle and remember that and remember

00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,240
the marketing funnel if there's if

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,610
there's any real content here it's

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,919
basically this one slide and that all of

00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,750
your you maybe don't have to focus on it

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,669
exclusively but if you want people to

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,520
use your project you need then to think

00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:00,140
of you know what are you doing and how

00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,690
are you where the where the roadblocks

00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,730
where is that funnel this isn't really

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,760
drawn to scale you would ideally want

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:10,790
people to become aware consider it use

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:15,940
it you know and like you want that angle

00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:18,980
to be pretty pretty sharp yeah sharp so

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,660
thinking about how many people just

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,370
thinking about this sort of thing use it

00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,530
as a framework when you're considering

00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,660
what's going on with your project where

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:34,360
your bottlenecks how are you going to

00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:36,290
reach more users um yep so with that I

00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,830
am going to open up the floor for

00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,830
questions

00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:47,559
you like the lone voice for marketing in

00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,600
your project or is your community

00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:53,289
generally sort of quite aware of this is

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,450
something we need to be doing I would

00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:59,169
say so the question are I guess he had

00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:01,120
the mic so um I would say that everyone

00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:03,940
was aware that we needed to do more

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,549
marketing it's a it's a community of

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,470
volunteers we have various amounts of

00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:11,100
time and you know every business is

00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:14,740
cyclical I had a strong background

00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,590
working in media agencies which for data

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:20,799
science or math people like it was

00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:22,389
somewhat different um so I was able to

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,340
see like yet we need to be talking about

00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:26,950
this we need to do this

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,360
there have been there's usually always a

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,679
couple people who are really really good

00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,970
speakers who like to go out and give the

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,200
talks and there and there still are

00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,639
ending new Suleman and erm you Suleman

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,320
is another guy on the project who's

00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:42,909
really been doing even more this year

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,940
than I have and we also had this kind of

00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:48,399
concept of a democracy where you know it

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:51,070
was like the logo everyone knew that the

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:54,220
logo the old logo was bad it was a bad

00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:57,940
logo we needed to do something else but

00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,769
no one was able to do anything and

00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,659
that's why again especially in the case

00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:03,159
of the logo it was great to have just

00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:05,980
like let's just have an outsider and

00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:08,380
randomly delegate the power to make

00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:11,200
something and then if no one complains

00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,809
okay that that works then let's it could

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,370
because it was and you shouldn't

00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:17,799
necessarily do that on all your projects

00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,570
and all your problems but sometimes the

00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,559
logo doesn't matter the logo has nothing

00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,980
to do with the effectiveness of the

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,230
product and we were except that the old

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,519
logo was bad so I guess yeah the

00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,340
community realizes that there's a

00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:34,389
problem some people will be better than

00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:36,779
others at helping out and jumping on

00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:36,779
board with that

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:44,880
like in this one the question is you get

00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:47,350
a lot of bike shed arguments yeah nope

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,570
totally um so the initial website

00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,909
refactor the question is do we get a lot

00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:54,070
of bike shed arguments visually you know

00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:56,549
if you ask everyone for their opinion

00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,440
and input everyone will give it to you

00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:00,700
we but again with the do or the do or

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,970
see especially in our community kind of

00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,010
carries the day go for it and open the

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,769
PR and see if anybody gripes and

00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,720
normally if they don't then cool we also

00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:12,250
but sometimes they will and when they do

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,899
gripe you should take it seriously don't

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:18,429
try to bully your things through I did a

00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:22,889
first pass on the website and it was

00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:25,510
hideous but it was something and because

00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:27,159
one someone on the project was on the

00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,809
ComicCon it wasn't like really felt

00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:31,330
moved over to the Jekyll and liked the

00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:33,100
internal code and I had like the new

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,840
website and staging so people could look

00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,039
at it and he accidentally committed

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,500
something and no one's really sure how

00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:40,389
but the new version of the site got

00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,149
launched and it was luckily at like 3:00

00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:46,690
in the morning but he's like do and I'm

00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:48,159
like oh I think I can and I had just in

00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,679
case we wanted to roll back to the old

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,179
site one day for like retro day I had

00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:56,169
kept the skin of the old site like okay

00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:59,320
we can save this don't worry got off

00:31:56,169 --> 00:32:00,909
traffic there in general no people are

00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,010
really as long as you if you're willing

00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:04,570
to do the work and if somebody doesn't

00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:07,299
like it then they should be willing to

00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:10,840
step up and do the work to um you can't

00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:12,370
just be a negative Nancy I would say is

00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:17,950
more of a community standard than an

00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:20,980
official role but it's a good one so

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,450
there there are a lot of talks about how

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,429
to do better marking for developers so

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,649
there a couple things that are a lot of

00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:28,149
other people are covering which is how

00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:29,649
to actually you know write something

00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:31,480
that's that's useful in approachable and

00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:32,889
then also how to plan which your you

00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,480
were talking about a bit is how like you

00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:35,679
organize your project because I'm not

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,120
gonna do it all but I can do one blog

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,700
post and maybe you can do something else

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,120
yep but the thing I thought was was new

00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:45,580
here was the reminder of your your graph

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,490
of effort versus effect mm-hmm right

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,750
because marketing is takes time yep

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,160
right you get your message out you've

00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,270
done something useful

00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,830
takes time for that to circulate for

00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,540
some realist or echo it which is not

00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:57,730
like what developers have I mean yes we

00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:01,240
complain that ci takes three hours to

00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:03,910
finish this bill but yeah awareness

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,520
thing is gonna take months to really

00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:08,140
show okay so be patient

00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,060

represent Ryan you're you're spot-on

00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,380
with that as developers we make a little

00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,770
change in the code we want to see the

00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,900

00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:22,210
faith of the admin to be like well we'll

00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:25,030
just do brand recognition advertising
