Description: 
	They don't understand me! - tales from the multi-cultural trenches

Communicating in written form is hard anyway, and our Open Source circles add the additional hurdle of different cultural backgrounds and sensitivities.

Irony doesn't work. Jokes don't work. People get offended for no reason. They don't get what you're saying. Or they get it all wrong. Misunderstandings and conflicts are just around the corner, although we think we do our best to be efficient, fun and entertaining when talking to our project communities.

The problem is that our cultural backgrounds get in the way and shape the way we perceive many of the subtle nuances of human communication. Puzzled (or horrified) faces can help steer face-to-face conversations the right way, but we don't have this luxury in the asynchronous written communications which are the norm in Open Development.

Based on 17 years of experience in many projects of the Apache Software Foundation, our concrete examples of fun anecdotes, unnerving communication mishaps and nuclear-level conflicts (almost) will help us avoid common pitfalls and have happier and more efficient conversations in multi-cultural environments.

thanks for being here it's a great

00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,090
pleasure to be on this stage again we

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:16,850
know a few times and it's a great venue

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:19,160
I like it so this talk is about how our

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,820
culture influences the way we

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,770
communicate in our open source projects

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,590
we have people from lots of different

00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:30,380
cultures and I think that often gets in

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,480
the way of how we communicate we

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:36,050
understand each other or how we

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,300
misunderstand each other so my name is

00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,790
Beth Lakota I'm from the french-speaking

00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,250
part of Switzerland I work for Adobe in

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,230
Basel Switzerland German speaking part

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,720
already is two slightly different

00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,660
cultures you'd be surprised

00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,399
I'm a principal scientist at Adobe so

00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,590
kind of an internal consultant doing

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,020
architecture in the Java content

00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,670
management space I'm also on the board

00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,450
of directors of the Apache Software

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:05,030
Foundation where I love listening to the

00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,369
accents on the board call we have an

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,010
Australian guy we have Ross Gardner

00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:12,650
who's from the UK we have American

00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,780
people European people and that also

00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:20,630
tells something about the culture and I

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:22,850
think it's a it's an asset so really

00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,630
having I think having this cultural

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,270
diversity

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,549
it's actually a great benefit for our

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,070
communities because if you think

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:34,729
slightly differently you will you will

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,650
expose different things you will you

00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,360
know you will see problems that others

00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,939
might not see because in their culture

00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,280
it's not a problem and I think it's

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,979
really an asset it's it's something that

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,040
that we should try and take advantage of

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:51,140
but for this on the other hand it makes

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,479
communication harder and I have a few

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,630
examples including some pretty dramatic

00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:59,299
ones where the culture and language and

00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:04,070
everything gets gets in the way and it's

00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:08,569
harder I enjoyed this morning's talk on

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:10,849
empathy a lot but it did it was mostly

00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:13,459
about face-to-face communication and

00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:16,430
when you're talking on a mailing list or

00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:17,650
on on on a chat channel or whatever it's

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,590
harder because

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:24,220
Saro bandwidth channel you know it's

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:28,450
riding it it's it's not as expressive as

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,549
you know if I talk to you like that you

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,829
will say okay disguise is a bit deep

00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:34,599
pressed so it might be be kind with him

00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:37,450
you know and if I'm here being the

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,970
winner then maybe you're thinking this

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,370
guy is being a bit arrogant it's not

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:46,840
good in writing it's harder to make this

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:48,879
kind of of you know expressions I'm

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,579
wondering how many cultures we have in a

00:02:48,879 --> 00:03:02,129
room can you yell what's your culture

00:02:51,579 --> 00:03:09,840
I'm Swiss French yes Italy Deutsch

00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:14,980
India South Pacific I like that yes

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,409
multicultural yes so we have many

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:22,500
cultures and I do we have any soccer

00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:27,669
fans yes do we have any sailors

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:30,699
musicians trumpet players no trumpet

00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:33,519
players drummers you're my friend I'm a

00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:36,310
drummer really you know culture is it's

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,040
not just the country were you from there

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,470
are many facets to the culture and if

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,079
you talk with soccer fans I'm not a

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:48,489
soccer fan but you might have some

00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:51,280
language or idioms you know in in the

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:53,400
u.s. people they will often say you

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,319
don't get past first base

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,239
what do you mean what what's first base

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,579
you know if you know the game is obvious

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,190
if you don't know it you don't know so

00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:05,409
that culture is much more than just the

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,889
country where you from or the the

00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:11,139
language that you speak the typical

00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:13,930
failure scenario when a disaster happens

00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:16,419
in our communities and but we'll see

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,419
also in other places you have a bad

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:20,799
decision initially that happens

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,690
nobody's perfect we all make mistakes

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,620
you make a mistake okay

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,969
the problem is in the middle you have

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,919
misunderstandings there's no course

00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:31,450
correction you know when you do a

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,720
mistake you need to

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:37,720
fix it and it means if you're steering a

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,760
car or boat or motorcycle changing you

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,270
your course if you don't understand each

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,400
other

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,840
this doesn't happen or it happens in the

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,000
wrong direction and that's when

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,610
disasters happen this is a pretty small

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,620
disaster here on the right but it can

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:55,300
get much worse as as we'll see

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:57,130
I could have many examples from the

00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,500
Apache Software Foundation and that that

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:03,120
was my initial idea I've been in DDS F

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,680
for 17 18 years now so I've seen and

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,810
participated and initiated a number of

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,090
mistakes and we could talk about these

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,820
and some of them would be funny more

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,430
than than some others but we survived

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,320
and the SF survive but I find some

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,120
interesting examples from other fields

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,790
so it might be a bit surprised by my

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:28,180
examples but I think they they give a

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:31,300
different context to things so I am a

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,700
sailor I'm I'm happy to have my sailing

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,160
instructor in the room a manual he was

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,280
on stage before when he was also a great

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,690
sailor and a great instructor and when

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,270
you're sailing the first thing you

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,610
should do is plot your course you know

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,590
decide how you which direction you're

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,350
going to stay to sail in order to stay

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,330
safe and this is an example you have an

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,130
island and you want to sail past it

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,900
pretty close to it because you want to

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,810
see the scenery or show you both to

00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:03,310
whoever's on the island so you you plot

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:05,440
your course with the red arrows and okay

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,170
so you decide okay we'll do this bearing

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,480
and then that at this point here it will

00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:13,600
change the bearing and go to another

00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,720
direction and then there's wind 17 knots

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,510
of wind the black arrow here is north

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,670
east the wind is pushing you towards the

00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,890
shore so you have to be careful don't

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,440
you know don't mess up and then if you

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:29,350
zoom it so this is a pretty rough map

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,910
chart and then if you zoom in you start

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,490
seeing that there's actually some

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,220
serious rocks near this show and if you

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,590
zoom in even more on the right the

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,630
yellow path this is this is a ground

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,270
that you don't want to hit with your

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,230
boat the small crosses that's rocks you

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,430
don't want to eat them

00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,650
so you're going to say

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,750
in this direction and then the wind will

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,750
be pushing you towards the shore and

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,820
it's kind of dangerous so I'm not sure

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,420
if it was a good idea whoever did this

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,430
chart

00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,740
they might mind not having a fantastic

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,270
idea but you have crew right you're not

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,430
alone on your boat if it's a big boat

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,770
you have several people so you kind of

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,100
counting on them to say help you cause

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,810
correction hey captain you know if I'm

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,060
the first mate with the manual as

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,640
captain I would say manual captain I

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,580
think that's a bit dangerous should we

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,340
really do that or how do we stay safe

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:26,050
even with this slightly hairy course and

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:29,710
if you don't communicate well that's

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:32,800
when disasters happen and this is

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,260
actually it's it's not it's not a fun

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,850
thing it's it's dramatic accident had

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,340
happened you probably heard of the Costa

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:42,850
Concordia and I've been reading the the

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:45,250
accident reports and it's pretty it's

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,350
interesting in a sad way because the

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,720
it's really you know you could say okay

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:52,150
that the captain did a big mistake to

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,510
decide to sail so close to the to the

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:57,190
coast but then he was not alone on this

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,960
boat and that you know there's first

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,730
made there's people who have some

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,460
authority to challenge the captain's

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:06,340
decisions or at least say something and

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:11,320
you know it was a bit hard on that boat

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:13,750
because on that ship I should say 38

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,550
different nationalities on the boat so

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,740
we need to find a common language to

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,960
communicate despite all the different

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,490
cultures and everything and the the

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,980
company decided that the working

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,080
language was Italian because the boat is

00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,690
Italian the boats papers are Italian so

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,480
let's speak Italian why not I'm not sure

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,520
if it's a you know I love Italians it

00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,070
sounds great and I love Italian people

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,530
and Italy but it's not the most common

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,690
language yeah it's not the language well

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,430
you have the most you know chance of

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,370
finding people who understand it

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:48,340
properly and even then the the first

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:51,640
engineer testified that he did not fully

00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:54,910
understand the orders given in the

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,100
Italian language you know first engineer

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,380
it's someone important you should make

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,930
sure that the communication gets true

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,780
and then the health the helmsman the guy

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,520
who's actually steering the boat

00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:09,190
testified that at times he did not

00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,440
understand the Masters orders where when

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,790
given in English so you have a serious

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,710
communications problem

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,140
and that's when when disasters happen

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,240
and you have examples here and bad

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,010
decisions like you know going 16 knots

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,220
so close to the coast it's pretty

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,450
dangerous but it I think that this could

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,400
still be avoided

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,010
if someone will you know a few people

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,420
said captain this is not going well we

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,330
need to do something else we need to

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,240
communicate properly and change course

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,030
in order to avoid the disaster did not

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,060
happen unfortunately so I think it

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:46,480
really demonstrates this this this you

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,430
know sequence a bad decision I think the

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,290
and the chart that I was showing is

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,540
actual chart that they recovered from

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,880
from the ship which is not a very

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,580
detailed chart you know they should have

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,460
used first a much more detailed chart

00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,320
and and and plotted they should have

00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,170
floated a more a much safer course it

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,970
was dangerous to start with but then the

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,040
real problem is that there was no course

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,280
correction nobody fixed the thing and

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,630
then you get big disasters and a very

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,950
sad one in this case luckily usually for

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,910
us the stakes are not that high but

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:23,430
still if you know if you do a bad job

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,600
there are probably as some

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,160
life-preserving devices that run on

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,980
apache software or software from

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:35,320
whatever committee you're in so it's

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:37,540
still serious stuff and then you know

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,270
the story of the Tower of Babel all the

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:45,220
all the different languages it would be

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,070
interesting to count how many languages

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,820
we have in the room we'll probably have

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:53,560
maybe 20 different languages at least

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,200
and even the language is not everything

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,240
there's all the subtle cultural things

00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,150
that you know don't get through because

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,340
different idioms if I tell you this

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,680
there is a zebra crossing around the

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,540
corner for some people a zebra crossing

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,190
is you know something that you use to

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,650
cross the street as a pedestrian and

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,800
others will figure zebra the animals

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,619
crossing a river

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,720
and and this is this in Berlin be around

00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:20,329
the corner it sounds really funny funny

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,999
guy you know and when you meet people

00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:25,819
how do you how do you cheer you know in

00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:28,610
in Switzerland if I meet friends that

00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:31,879
are know well I would kiss them on the

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:35,119
cheek three times in France it's four or

00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:39,429
sometimes two it's two it depends on the

00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:42,619
region and then my people my kids around

00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:44,269
2530 years old and and the first time

00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,339
you meet them they will do that they

00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:49,279
will kiss you on the cheeks even if you

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,720
don't know the person and for me you

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,519
know it's usually because I know the

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,449
person well all these small things

00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:59,899
cultural things I was lucky to travel to

00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:02,299
Australia to an Aboriginal preserve to

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,949
go fishing and we are supposed to get a

00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:05,540
guide so you go there and you meet the

00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:07,869
people and you shake hands and you look

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,160
them in the eye and then someone said

00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:12,230
you know if you shake hands to these

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,089
people it might means you want to fight

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,879
and if you look them in the eye it's

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:19,009
it's you're trying to show that you're

00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,990
stronger than them it it's not something

00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:24,439
you want to do you know and in my

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:27,499
country if I don't shake hands and only

00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:29,410
look people in the eye it's in price so

00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:32,059
you know subtle or not so subtle

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:35,809
cultural things the gestures you know

00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:38,329
the this divers okay in some countries

00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:40,730
means something very bad so have to be

00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:42,559
careful with that how do you cheer when

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,509
you drink here at the conference we're

00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,959
going to have beers later you know how

00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:48,649
do you

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,410
it's very cultural and you can you can

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:55,579
come across as rude because you don't do

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,829
things in the way the people expect the

00:12:55,579 --> 00:13:00,110
there's a rubber in the UK this thing

00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:01,610
here the eraser is called a rubber in

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,819
other countries it means something very

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,369
different and you know and call McCarty

00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:10,069
and guy from Apache wrote that on

00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:12,739
Twitter was it a good funeral when you

00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:14,629
went to a funeral in Ireland it's

00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:17,360
something you are expected to ask was it

00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:19,309
a good funeral in some countries what do

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,100
you mean good funeral are there any good

00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:25,369
funerals so it's all very solid things

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,660
which can be awkward when you're meeting

00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:28,009
people in person but

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,649
think they also influence the way we

00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:34,279
communicate in in writing on our on our

00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:37,399
mailing lists or or whatever the jokes

00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:40,879
are also very cultural this is you know

00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,220
this is a joke from my country and then

00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,319
when you when you tell the jokes you you

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,629
might get faces like that someone filed

00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:49,490
finds it extremely funny and the other

00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,079
person is offended because in their

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,139
culture is not something you're supposed

00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:56,300
to joke about and sometimes if what you

00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:58,600
say is that even a joke you know what's

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,009
the difference between the dark

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,990
usually the first question you get is a

00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:07,490
dark on what No what's the difference

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:09,500
between a dark actually the difference

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:14,689
is that both the legs are of the same

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:17,629
length especially the left one you know

00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:20,769
some people will find it funny some

00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:23,660
people will find it completely stupid

00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:26,209
some people will even wonder if it's a

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,889
joke you know it's difficult and and

00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:30,920
that's the kind of things that that

00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:33,079
usually can go bad between cultures and

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,810
you look stupid or you offend people

00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,850
without I hope this will not often

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,709
anyone it's not very very risky one but

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,800
there are some risky jokes and you have

00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:44,990
to be very careful about that

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,410
another cultural thing is how you

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:52,579
express your appreciation or not in my

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:55,490
country in my region if I say it's okay

00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:58,130
that's very positive you know if I see

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,980
something is pretty okay I'm being very

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,680
enthusiastic about it whereas some other

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,480
countries will say it's amazing it's

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,490
great it's fantastic what you did here

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,949
better I like you I love you I've loved

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,410
you forever and you know it's very clear

00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:15,189
appreciation or as if I tell you it's

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:18,019
pretty okay you know it's not

00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:19,730
fantastically expressive appreciation so

00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:21,439
here we have someone else on Twitter

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,540
saying you know the opposite when

00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:27,529
something is wrong you can say this is

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,209
wrong or you can say I'm sorry but isn't

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,610
there a small problem here with this

00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:34,490
thing and it in the end it means the

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,019
same thing but you would do it's telling

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,750
it differently I have a work colleague

00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,860
that tends to very often say this is

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,019
wrong

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,240
and it makes me feel uncomfortable I

00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,670
don't like that you know I like to have

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,730
at least be given an option how to fix

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:52,610
it or something a bit subtle but it's

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,980
it's not there's there are no bad

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,390
intentions he means right he means to

00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,029
fix the problem but in a way that

00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:02,839
doesn't go well with my my cultural

00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:05,390
background this is typical to French and

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,490
not all languages I don't know a few

00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,850
languages have this the - and vous you

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,800
know and in English it's you but even in

00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,959
English there's some polite form you

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,640
know if I say miss crowns or I say Merle

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,290
that that's one of them is kind of more

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,630
polite than the other and then how do

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,089
you decide this is a flowchart for

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,130
deciding in French it's kind of on the

00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:31,790
funny side but it's not that wrong you

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:34,190
know if if your kid talking to an adult

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,230
you'll save you and if an adult is

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,110
talking to a kid they'll say - which is

00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,779
a familiar form and if you know and then

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,850
you meet someone having beers and you

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,709
say - and then you figure out this

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,779
person is the president of your country

00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:50,600
and then you meet them in a different

00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:53,510
setting and you say vous the polite form

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,519
it's very subtle and and it can also go

00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,740
wrong when you change countries I'm sure

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,350
between France and Canada for example

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,449
both speak French but I'm sure that the

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,089
use is quite different when you say -

00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:06,740
and when you say vous polite form so

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,740
this is also something that that can

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,780
that can throw you off and even as I say

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,230
in English there are some polite forms

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:18,919
even there's just you when you speak

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:21,799
directly to people you can make a face

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,500
you know if if I look at who you like

00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:26,209
this you can imagine that I'm not being

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,640
totally happy and and when you speak

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:31,220
directly to people you can get this

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,870
feedback much quicker by by making a

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,660
face showing that you don't understand

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,600
or you disagree or you you kind of

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:42,200
thrown off it's very easy in writing

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,630
it's much harder you know it's it's you

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,830
have to be much more explicit saying I

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,570
am uncomfortable with this or I don't

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,160
understand what you're saying maybe

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,480
because of my culture you know you have

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,860
to be more it's

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,409
sometimes it sounds a bit complicated

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,510
but but you have to do that so so you

00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:02,179
don't have the luxury of making a face

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:12,010
to express what what you what you have

00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:14,059
so it's really complicated the you know

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,490
due to the fact that we're communicating

00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,809
and writing as synchronously it makes

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:22,669
the whole thing much more complicated

00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:24,409
and culture so in the beginning you know

00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,149
when I was asking about culture most

00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:29,440
people will say they where they come

00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:32,960
from which country or which language and

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,909
here we have an example where I think so

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,669
you probably know about this another

00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:40,070
this another sad disaster it's not funny

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:42,080
at all but it's interesting to study how

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:45,230
these things happen and try to find out

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,990
how you can avoid them next time this is

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,480
a challenger space shuttle from 1986

00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:53,029
which exploded after a few seconds of

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,730
flight and the thing is that when they

00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,740
launched it they already had launched a

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,200
number of shuttles you see in the

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,710
diagram in the middle it's from Edward

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,230
Tufte z-- Edward Tufte is a professor

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,210
who who's been writing a few fantastic

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,970
books on how you visualize information

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:14,000
and the diagram in the middle is tough

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,830
this diagram to show the problem the

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,659
dots the black dots that you have under

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:21,139
mostly on the right there are the

00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:23,240
successful launches and the higher the

00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:26,389
more problems they had with the orange a

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,269
type of joint you know seals that that

00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:31,460
had problems in the in the Challenger

00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:33,559
shuttle so we kind of see a curve like

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,769
that and it gets worse as the

00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:39,889
temperature gets lower and the the green

00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:42,649
ellipses here is where the this

00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:45,830
problematic launch was so it was much

00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:48,409
colder than the the other launches there

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,360
were there was ice on the ice pad it was

00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:53,990
minus freezing point during the night

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,360
and for many engineers it was obvious

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,880
that it was very risky to launch the

00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,460
show because these o-rings were not

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,590
designed for such cold temperatures and

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,960
it they were not exactly sure what might

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,960
happen and then the worst happened

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,240
the problem is that part of the problem

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,480
is that the engineers were not able to

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:17,000
communicate the problem in a suitable

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,510
way to the to the managers who were

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,880
making the decisions so here you have in

00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,830
engineering versus managers culture and

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,770
those are slightly different cultures

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,080
you know as engineers if I put this a

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,600
bit you know in a very schematic form as

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,670
an engineer I want to do a fantastic

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,890
engineering job I want my software to be

00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,470
perfect to have no bugs to be nice to be

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,140
you know cute to read or any anything

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,320
you can imagine as a manager I want to

00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,720
sell the you know I want to sell

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,300
the product and make money so that I can

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,430
pay the engineers so they can feed their

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,770
families and have a house and live it's

00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,110
kind of you know it might be opposing

00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:00,530
constraints and and then it influences

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,780
your culture in a way and so what I'm

00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,430
saying here is that the culture can be

00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,970
much more than just where you come from

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,980
or what language to speak in the the box

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,620
here John primary concern that you could

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,600
probably can't really read it was it's a

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,270
typical engineering report they're

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,550
they're listing items you know

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:21,860
temperature is low the joint the o-rings

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,810
might have problems and the thing might

00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,450
explode but it's just bullet points you

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,010
know whereas if someone would have come

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,190
up with such a diagram like in the

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,740
middle it might be much more obvious for

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,480
the manager to see it doesn't make sense

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,420
to launch this this thing

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,740
let's not launch it so the culture can

00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:44,540
hide in in unexpected places so this

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,390
doesn't make our job better it's very

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:50,410
complicated and and then we have to find

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:54,020
ways to fix it and avoid these problems

00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:57,800
so how we can avoid them is by acting in

00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:01,220
this middle element of my diagram the

00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,380
bad decisions as I as I think it's

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,720
obviously bad decisions they happen

00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,510
everybody makes mistakes and in a group

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,640
it you know and then initial bad

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,460
decision can happen what we can

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,500
influence is can we discuss more

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,900
efficiently have better communications

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,580
so that we can cause correct and avoid

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,799
the disasters

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,080
so let's try to see how we can fix this

00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:28,309
in the end it's yet it's just about the

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:31,070
communications an interesting example

00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:35,389
from also a slightly different field I

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:37,970
recently found out that the the aviation

00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:40,309
airline industry they have defined and

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:43,850
standardized a simplified English

00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:45,739
language for the technical manuals for

00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,649
for airplanes and you know everything

00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:52,429
that goes around aviation and it's a

00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:54,440
great way to make it easier because part

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,629
of the problem is also that for most of

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,759
us English is our second or third or

00:22:56,629 --> 00:23:01,309
fourth language and it's not all native

00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:03,499
language so we might and master all the

00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:05,359
subtleties of English so and it's the

00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:06,919
same thing in their aviation manuals

00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,440
because you have people doing aviation

00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,989
maintenance from very different

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:16,029
countries and modeling model tanks so

00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:18,950
they have defined this ASD is ASD ste

00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:21,259
100 language which is a simplified

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,440
version of English with only I think

00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:26,690
only like a thousand words and it has

00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,789
lots of examples of how you should

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,590
phrase things so to make them

00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:33,019
understandable here we have an example

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,559
from the robot world Hobart virtual

00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:40,009
website for example instead of saying

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,619
all valves must be turned slowly you say

00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:45,700
turn all bar slowly you know active

00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:48,440
voice present tense very simple phrases

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,539
shorter phrases as well remove

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,809
everything that's not too absolutely

00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:55,639
required make it concise make it simple

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:58,429
and I think that's a great thing that we

00:23:55,639 --> 00:24:00,580
can do in on in our communications on

00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:05,179
our mailing lists on on or description

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:07,639
channels to stick to simple language we

00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:10,309
have some people I know some some in

00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:13,009
Apache who are fantastic riders and the

00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:16,669
right very nice phrase is very sometimes

00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:19,429
exotic and a bit complicated i express

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:22,580
things in a subtle way it's not very

00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:24,619
good for the others you know you know

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,499
then I'm not only native English speaker

00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:29,179
and even after 17 years in the Apache

00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,190
Software Foundation I have to look

00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:32,869
upward sometimes even in the in the

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,440
board meetings on the board calls we

00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:36,440
have a back

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,720
channel on the IRC on chat and sometimes

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,370
I ask what does the person mean with

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,129
this idiom with this expression because

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:45,110
I don't know it so bye-bye you know

00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:47,570
sticking to a simple language making

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:53,769
your communication simpler you can help

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:55,850
get your message across to avoid

00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:58,279
misunderstandings this is you know this

00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:01,700
is communications 1 or 101 but I think

00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:04,100
it's it's simple principles that we

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,830
should we should use when communicating

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,799
assume good intentions know when you get

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,379
an email and ok you think people are

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,149
being rude or they're they're

00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:17,179
considering you as an idiot or you know

00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:18,860
not taking your your value added into

00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:21,620
account or whatever figure figure out

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:24,590
this this care be here this care care

00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:28,490
bear here that's the difficult one you

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:31,039
know imagine people usually people want

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,870
to be nice and even if they don't you

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,539
should assume they will they want you

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:38,000
know if you react immediately with a

00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:40,009
nasty email and and things can escalate

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,919
very quickly so it's always a good idea

00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:45,350
to assume good intentions how you know

00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,139
what is the person really trying to do

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:50,659
or even if they're being a bit nasty

00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:53,330
usually it's for the sake of the project

00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:55,519
hopefully you know you can try to find

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,409
something positive this was also

00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,629
something that was said in this

00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:02,149
morning's empathy talk where they have

00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:04,159
this retrospectives where everyone has

00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:06,799
to say something positive about someone

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,570
else it's a good thing to do and and I

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,909
think we should try to do that to avoid

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:16,190
escalating things and then ask for

00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:19,429
clarification very often the message is

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,379
not as you understood it or even the

00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:23,210
person has a message in their mind and

00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:25,820
what they wrote is not exactly that

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,409
they're you know there's some shift and

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,320
then it turns you to something nasty

00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:32,480
even though at the beginning it was you

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,850
know supposed to be to be it was good

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,320
and with good intentions so you should

00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:40,759
always do that reformulate you know I'm

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,470
always trying to do that when we have

00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:43,159
difficult discussion even in one of our

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,679
projects

00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,000
I always reformulate what I understood

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,250
you know if

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,400
I understand correctly you are saying

00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:55,370
that such and such and then it's a good

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,810
check and then if someone is really some

00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,530
saying something nasty

00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:03,050
you can reformulate it in you know but

00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:06,350
keeping the nastiness you know if I

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:10,850
understand correctly you are saying that

00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,960
I'm not capable of doing that job if you

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,450
think that's what the people are saying

00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,820
it's fine reformulate it like that

00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,770
without being aggressive but expressing

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,930
what you want you you understood and

00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,940
then you will go to recycles a few times

00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,580
and hopefully get to the to the right

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,640
message the problem can be sometimes our

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,980
ego you know I don't want to look weak

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,590
or one want to look too much like a Care

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,140
Bear it's you know it's not my style so

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,270
so you have to be careful and sometimes

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,390
just show your eye go out of the window

00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:44,830
and and just try to be nice for the sake

00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:47,300
of the project I was telling about I

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,830
come in Apache one of the first

00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,160
communities where I was involved with

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:55,370
cocoon and cocoon was a fantastic

00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,800
community because it was mostly small

00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:00,440
companies or independents and we all had

00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,140
a business based on cocoon so when we

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,050
disagreed we didn't say okay I'm out of

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,940
here by now I need to stay in this

00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:10,310
project because it's my business so we

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,680
found ways to fix it and we talked and

00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,630
discussed and clarified until we found

00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,340
some agreement and I think that that's a

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,110
good example depending on your stakes in

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,090
a project you're not just going to walk

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,940
out you you will fix things and that

00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,890
that's great another thing that can help

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,350
is graphics when you have to explain

00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:30,320
something complicated it's much better

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,730
to do drawing a diagram or whatever you

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,310
know here typically this is also

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,830
something cultural in in Switzerland we

00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:40,160
have four official languages so all all

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:42,950
our road signs are you know pictograms

00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,980
they are graphic because you if we

00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,590
needed to write something like dangerous

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,780
turn we would have to write this in four

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,940
languages doesn't work so you do it you

00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,530
do a nice pictogram I think I like the I

00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,920
like the graphic on the right it it's

00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:01,400
very clear be careful with all people

00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:03,260
you know that I think bow

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,980
hopefully all cultures would recognize

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,050
it like that

00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:09,140
so graphics can help if you have to

00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:12,710
express something complex another thing

00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:16,960
is we are lucky we are writing on code

00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:19,850
so if you have to explain something I

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,440
don't like the the long technical

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,630
discussions you know we write an email

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,210
with twenty five paragraphs explaining

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,670
what you want to do do it you know do a

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,290
prototype and show it to to the to the

00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:33,740
others even if it's ugly

00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:36,080
unfinished not stable whatever it's

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,180
often much more expressive than

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,210
explaining it you know if you can show

00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:43,850
some code or even some code excerpts and

00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,730
that's a luxury that we have even though

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,980
the write written form is harder we know

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,170
how to code and often we know how to

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:54,380
express ourselves Prima pretty well with

00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:58,640
code so that's that's something that can

00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:01,690
also help us get clear communications if

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,850
you do fantastic jokes like the dark one

00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:08,150
be explicit about them you know say okay

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:10,340
in the extreme you say now I am going to

00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,290
tell you a joke and it's a joke from my

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,680
culture so maybe you will not like it

00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:17,540
but I like to tell you this joke and you

00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,290
know in an email you can tweet a joke

00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:24,470
marker or irony or sarcasm or whatever

00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:26,600
it feels a bit strange sometimes you

00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,420
know because if if you have to mark up

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,730
your irony it's it's the effect is a

00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,920
kind of a bit lost but it's much safer

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:36,980
so you have to be careful or maybe you

00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,530
can avoid it completely I'm not I'm not

00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:42,350
a big fan of political correctness

00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:44,300
it can be very boring so I like you know

00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,510
I like to make some jokes and try to

00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,830
have some some entertaining stuff in our

00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,870
communications but you have to be

00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:53,000
careful and Mark things clearly so

00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:55,520
people know are you being serious or not

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,910
and very often you see that on a mailing

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,280
list

00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:01,850
you know sometimes someone writes a

00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:04,820
sentence another person replies kind of

00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:06,950
somewhat angry and the other says yeah

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,650
but I was joking so you know if you're

00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:13,310
joking put at least smiley or something

00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:14,620
that that helps people find out I have a

00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:17,559
few example of

00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:20,559
you know how to phrase things so so you

00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:22,840
leave it open and and you try to bring

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,570
the temperature down and calm things

00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,760
down the left one is one that I wrote on

00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,640
an internal mailing list at work

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,260
recently I'm freaking out when I see

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,440
comments that apply that we might be

00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,809
married to such proprietary services and

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,120
then I added I'm freaking out in a

00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:42,669
friendly way with a smiley you know to

00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,299
say I'm not angry freaking out is just a

00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:48,909
way to express that this makes me an

00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:51,070
uncomfortable try to you know maybe make

00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:56,289
a joke about yourself it's not dangerous

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:58,149
for the others or you know try to as I

00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:00,490
say on the right focus like a warrior

00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:02,679
you want to get to your destination but

00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:06,059
friendly like a Care Bear Express things

00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:08,080
in as in a very friendly way as possible

00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:10,690
reformulating I'm not sure what you mean

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,120
by substandard do you mean I'm totally

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,100
incapable of doing that or it just you

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,460
don't like the way I wrote the code find

00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:21,429
out ask for for confirmation then the

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,350
last one is when when someone you know

00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:27,909
when someone will call you code a piece

00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:30,399
of I would reply you could reply

00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:32,649
with calling people names you know but

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,380
it's much better to say what you said

00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:37,510
makes me uncomfortable it's about me so

00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:40,630
how can we fix it and how can we fix it

00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:43,240
for the sake of the project try to you

00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:45,039
know leave options open for whoever

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,799
wrote what you consider a nasty message

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:52,090
and and you know make sure you go

00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:54,960
forward for the sake of your project and

00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,710
you know again recommendations about

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,350
communications 101

00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,510
I think being direct helps don't take

00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:04,240
too many detours if you're unhappy about

00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:06,549
something it's fine to say it if you say

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,350
I am unhappy that's a fact

00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:10,270
nobody can hate you for saying that you

00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:12,309
have the right to be unhappy and it

00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,990
doesn't you know call other people names

00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:15,730
or whatever because in the end you

00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,590
really want that course correction to

00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,440
happen if you're on the project you want

00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:23,169
to project project to succeed and there

00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,020
will be bad decisions so you need to you

00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:29,170
know contribute to fixing them

00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,970
so here's my coda this is my musicians

00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,980
culture showing up you know I call my

00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:35,410
conclusions coda if you don't know what

00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:40,179
a coda is in a music piece it's a piece

00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:43,450
that comes at the end okay so really

00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:45,550
again I think if you can remember just

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,490
one thing from from this talk it's I

00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:50,800
think this diagram bad decision followed

00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:54,370
by miscommunications leads to disaster

00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,440
and we can improve that by improving the

00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:58,480
communications to make sure the course

00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:03,059
correction happens ain't not going to

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:06,130
hit the Giglio island with your ship so

00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:09,550
it requires good communications and I

00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:12,220
think to help the communications be

00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:14,530
better it's our job to verify that there

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,389
are no misunderstandings and no hidden

00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,580
cultural obstacles you know all these

00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:20,590
subtle cultural things that we discussed

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,810
they get in the way of our communication

00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:25,270
so it's fine to check and double-check

00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,100
and ask for clarification make sure you

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,320
have understood and then this can help

00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,810
us have more efficient communications

00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,240
hopefully thank you for your attention

00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:38,260
this was the first time I did this talk

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,179
so I hope it's been useful and open to

00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:46,210
feedback to improve it for next time

00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:54,250
thank you and we have four minutes and

00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:59,040
53 seconds for questions I think thank

00:34:54,250 --> 00:35:03,520
you for your talk I identified a problem

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:09,160
especially in open source seen in East

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:11,320
Asia I mean for us mainland or European

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,560
we're struggling enough with learning

00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:17,350
English and for East Asian it's much

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,750
more difficult to learn English and I

00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:22,330
think that's holding a lot of people off

00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:24,670
to get involved into open source

00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:27,820
communities it's only when they are

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,200
joining big companies then they have to

00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:33,980
learn English

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:37,910
to some degree and I think there's so

00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:42,170
much potential in that area which we

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:44,990
cannot use I but I don't have a obvious

00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:47,540
solution yeah yeah it's it's a

00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:50,450
difficulty that we see in so I'm very

00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,369
active in in Apache we have some

00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,760
projects now where there's lots of

00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:58,250
people at least nothing from China and

00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,589
and it's its difficulty and of course

00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:03,380
people are much more comfortable

00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:05,329
speaking their own language from the

00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,400
point of view of the foundation we have

00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,200
to have oversight of what happens in our

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,930
projects and I don't think we are

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,930
resources at this point to do that with

00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:17,180
non-english projects I'm hoping that

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:19,910
this happens at some point but then we

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:23,510
need to have a clear structure of you

00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:26,030
know translation and reporting I totally

00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:29,030
agree that that's that's a problem and

00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:31,069
I'm not sure the way we can fix it is

00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,780
that if you speak those languages or

00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:34,790
anyone who speaks those languages should

00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,680
get involved and help make that happen

00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:38,359
and we have some people in Apache who

00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,700
are starting to do that but I would say

00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:44,599
it's really been beginnings of that

00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:47,150
thank you thank you for a great talk I

00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:52,819
wish I listen to this this morning

00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:54,819
before I respond on an email so my

00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:57,640
question is how do you deal with

00:36:54,819 --> 00:37:01,930
cultures that are you know inherently

00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:04,670
closed like you mentioned East Asia yeah

00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:06,619
they're inherently closed for whatever

00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,839
reasons they're comfortable to talk in

00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:11,839
their own language or they don't like to

00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:13,730
share how do you deal with when you're

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,109
working with such people and in a

00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,809
constructive way how do you have

00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:22,160
feedback and make all of us involved

00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:25,460
yeah I think so I'm working adobe has I

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,420
think 16,000 employees currently in all

00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,910
over the globe

00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,520
and we have some cultures where it's

00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,349
very hierarchical I'm not supposed to

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,839
talk directly to the engineer I have to

00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:37,549
talk to the manager and that that makes

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,970
that's part of this kind of

00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:41,809
complications I think also as was said

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,380
in this

00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:48,079
morning's talk finding allies is a key

00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:50,779
finding the few people who who will get

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,420
in with your way of doing things and

00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:56,029
then encouraging them to come up and do

00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:58,609
it and be examples for others that

00:37:56,029 --> 00:38:00,859
that's one way that I can see now it's

00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:04,519
you cannot impose things on people I

00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:08,390
think what works best is I will change

00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:11,449
my ways if I see an example from someone

00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:13,160
whom I trust and I will tend to trust

00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:14,869
more people from my saying the same

00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,400
culture you know I trust Emmanuel

00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:18,259
because it is a sailor

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,989
he's a french-speaking guy he's a friend

00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:23,239
so you tend to trust it's always I think

00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:26,150
we have an inherent in our brains we

00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:28,640
have this wiring of us versus the others

00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,739
and it's always difficult to find out

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,509
who's the other and if I consider

00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:34,729
someone the other I will tend to trust

00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:36,380
them less so I think if you can you have

00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,359
this group of people who are not on

00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,549
board with your things but you have one

00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:43,430
or two people who might be getting in

00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:45,799
try to identify those and work with them

00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:48,259
or encourage them to come up so that

00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:50,390
they can be examples for the others it's

00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:53,890
it's one small thing I'll agree that

00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,890
that the problem is larger than that

00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,200
so I have two questions the first one

00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,049
when say hits a rock they're probably

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,269
cool to go squad say telling that they

00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:11,779
were thinking what did the core squat

00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:14,119
answered sorry I have a hard time

00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:17,809
hearing you yeah you know it was Troop

00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:21,200
stupid joke anyway I guess everyone

00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:23,690
knows about you know we are thinking

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,609
yeah thinking yeah the accents get in

00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,529
the way that's what if you say we are

00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:29,690
thinking and the others response what

00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:30,380
are you thinking about that can be a

00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:34,430
problem

00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:40,190
so my real question was about something

00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:41,750
different we owe some refugee I don't

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,329
know how to tell in English a

00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:47,150
preconception preconception of other

00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:49,309
people from other country like French we

00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:51,460
think that German are very strict and so

00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:54,500
on how do you deal with those kind of

00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:56,240
preconceptions right I think I think we

00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,730
should just forget about so I'm sorry I

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,650
you know I showed the thing about the

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,480
German saying this is wrong the the

00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,460
British saying I'm sorry could there be

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,170
a problem here and the Americans saying

00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,960
this is amazing but maybe there's a

00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:11,690
small problem with that this was not my

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,789
text it was just quoting someone from

00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:16,490
from Twitter I think though that those

00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:18,230
are very can be very nasty and and when

00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,119
I wanna hear people saying oh the

00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:23,839
journals are like that or the Americans

00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:26,000
are like that I know maybe some maybe a

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,819
majority of them can be like that but

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,069
don't generalize you know it's people

00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:33,559
have some trade character traits that

00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:35,119
you it's good to it I identify them but

00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:37,549
I think we should be very careful about

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,099
not generalizing they are all definitely

00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:42,619
some cultural biases which influence our

00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:45,200
communications but they can be you know

00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:47,180
I'm sure there are some some Germans

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,450
that would react like the American in in

00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,579
the the example that showed or it we

00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,640
have to be very and it's also a form of

00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:57,769
racism you know to say because you

00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,720
because you know allows your your form

00:40:57,769 --> 00:41:01,190
German origins I would say last I'm sure

00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,759
you're like that because you're you're

00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:08,150
born Germany this is totally wrong

00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:10,430
exactly oh okay so I'm falling in my

00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,340
face here but it would be totally wrong

00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,410
all right Manuel

00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,740
you live in Paris so the Paris people

00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:19,920
they're always you know busy or whatever

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:23,100
it's really wrong you have to judge the

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,650
people you know or identified the style

00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,660
by what do people actually do and and I

00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,900
would I think we should avoid these they

00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,700
are fun in jokes but not I don't don't

00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:39,390
thing more than that I don't think it's

00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:42,540
useful but um Maceo what is the path

00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:45,980
thank you for your presentation and we

00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,980
