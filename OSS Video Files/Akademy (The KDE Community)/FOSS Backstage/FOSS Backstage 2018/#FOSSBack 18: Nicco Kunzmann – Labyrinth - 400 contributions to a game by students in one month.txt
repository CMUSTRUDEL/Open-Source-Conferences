Title: #FOSSBack 18: Nicco Kunzmann â€“ Labyrinth - 400 contributions to a game by students in one month
Publication date: 2018-06-20
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	The FOSSASIA labyrinth is a game for kids to change to their liking: new rooms, music, features. The architecture and process allow steady contribution to the game with gradually increasing difficulty.

How can we make open-source projects a place for learning and continuous growth? How can we bring young people into open-source? These are questions I would like to answer. Over the past three years of Google Code-In, I maintained two games with increasing contributions by students. I would like to share the experience I have gained and end with a discussion about how to open up the contributing process for younger people and newcomers and how to keep them engaged.
