Title: #FOSSBack 18: Nicco Kunzmann â€“ Labyrinth - 400 contributions to a game by students in one month
Publication date: 2018-06-20
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	The FOSSASIA labyrinth is a game for kids to change to their liking: new rooms, music, features. The architecture and process allow steady contribution to the game with gradually increasing difficulty.

How can we make open-source projects a place for learning and continuous growth? How can we bring young people into open-source? These are questions I would like to answer. Over the past three years of Google Code-In, I maintained two games with increasing contributions by students. I would like to share the experience I have gained and end with a discussion about how to open up the contributing process for younger people and newcomers and how to keep them engaged.

	00:00:04,180 --> 00:01:20,650
I'll show a short introductory video

00:00:08,520 --> 00:01:24,979
[Music]

00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:27,410
yes so this video this wasn't done by me

00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,590
so I didn't create it but it was one of

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,930
the students who created the video and I

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,440
would like to introduce you to the

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,940
labyrinth game and my focus which I had

00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,250
when we developed this game with the

00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,160
students is how to create a learning

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,520
experience not so much how do we have a

00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,880
long living open source project where

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,590
many people can contribute but how to

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,950
spark a lot of people into the project

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:59,090
and maybe maybe it stops yeah and this

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:05,990
what I got from this I would like to

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:07,369
share with you so uhm yeah what we can

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,739
we can first have a look at the

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,780
labyrinth and what it looks like so then

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,660
you may already see where are the places

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,880
where one can contribute to this game so

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:21,890
first we reopen the labyrinth and we

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,840
have characters we can choose and after

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,790
we've chosen the character we can we can

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,440
walk around so now I've chosen a little

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,610
elephant and I can walk through the

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:35,410
labyrinth and sometimes they pop up some

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:43,610
notes about rooms I enter and yeah

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:50,810
minecraft and there are some bugs too in

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:56,630
the game for example we're yeah

00:02:50,810 --> 00:03:00,170
that is when end much more like you can

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:02,269
earn badges for for doing some things

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:07,400
for entering different levels or

00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:11,600
different places yeah that is in short a

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,150
labyrinth and the vision for me is that

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,579
we we have this game it is customized by

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,680
by the students a lot of students can

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:21,020
come in there are low thresholds for

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,180
contributing and they're always welcome

00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,120
to do so so we haven't

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:30,260
environment wages welcoming to the other

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:37,609
students how can we proceed further we

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:39,409
can talk about where this happened so of

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:42,109
course there were a lot of students

00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:44,469
contributing but how do I get access to

00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:47,269
these students so there's this

00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:49,099
competition called google code-in and

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,920
some of you who've been to the talk

00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:53,719
about empathy they heard that that

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,810
there's google code-in and this is a

00:03:53,719 --> 00:04:01,430
competition where students can sign up

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:07,220
too and they can work on tasks so toss

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:09,169
like small yeah small things they can do

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,419
like upload a picture to the website

00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:13,730
show that you've learned get create a

00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:16,910
promotional video and from this

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,889
conversation on they can join any

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,560
open-source organization that signed up

00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:26,660
it verse 25 open-source organizations

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:30,220
and yeah and contribute to the projects

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,220
they have set up for google codon

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:51,300
so what what is it like if if you

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:55,770
contribute to the game um actually I

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:58,790
lost my notes I get my notes I'll talk

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,840
about this also like you can if you see

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:14,880
yeah yeah I would like something for

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:16,860
kissing uh for anyone please yeah okay

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,530
how does work how did the students get

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:24,510
the different tasks and what inspired

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:26,820
them so we we launched a lot of tasks so

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,610
students can come in so these tasks I

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,060
can show some of them they are for

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,370
example they're all listed here on the

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,770
webpage so students are allowed to edit

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,410
their own tasks and we can upload them

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:43,620
afterwards to the to the google code-in

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:47,670
side and there's for example the tasks

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,880
how to add a character and this is quite

00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,200
an easy task you have to remember when

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,560
you are a student you've never used

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,420
github you may need actually to get an

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,290
email address to get into google codon

00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:04,620
and then you need to don't get and then

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:06,900
if you're saying okay you need to

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,180
contribute a lot of code before we can

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,240
get your contribution then those

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,660
students mostly will fail so adding a

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:20,730
character is one way of reducing the

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:23,100
load for a student so they paint a paint

00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,470
a character on the computer maybe you

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,750
would paint better with Inkscape because

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,630
it's an SVG game where you can zoom in

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:35,180
and everything is clear and then they

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:38,010
have to edit one style of JavaScript and

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,380
yeah then we can merge and they have

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,760
their character into the game and can

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,890
play with the character and I think

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,449
that's an experience that keeps them

00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,090
with the game

00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:50,520
there they're even more tasks that the

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,949
students can choose for example to add a

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,490
level so of course we have those small

00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:59,490
tasks like add a character and there's

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,889
add a level now we can create many tiles

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:07,770
you can create a new whole landscape

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:09,719
with different places to go and there

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,610
are also other types of tasks so these

00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:16,589
are coding tasks but there are also

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:19,199
tasks that that change it that changed

00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:23,189
the whole experience of contributing for

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,550
example please enable a new task so for

00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:28,349
example their student said oh cool we

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,120
can contribute to the game we have added

00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:33,360
a character we have added a new place

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,020
where you can go but I would like to

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,839
have some music and actually there was

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:44,219
somebody claimed this task and created

00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:47,279
an API for other students to play music

00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:49,999
so that for them it is as easy to add

00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,620
music as to add a character so they

00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:54,749
upload a file and then they added a

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,229
little bit of a JavaScript just say okay

00:07:54,749 --> 00:08:01,439
I've got this music file and some

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:05,610
copyright notice then this file is

00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:09,089
played so we can actually have coding

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,249
tasks and we have can we can get the

00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:13,499
feedback of the students to create even

00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:14,749
more tasks for other students and they

00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:17,189
enjoy creating an application

00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:20,129
programming interface totally new

00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:23,159
experience than just using it making it

00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:28,199
usable for other students and there's of

00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:33,930
also another kind of task which is you

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:37,680
know cooperate cooperation and so the

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,329
the point of this task is that I want to

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,829
show the students that you are able to

00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:44,039
do this on your own

00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:45,870
so when another person creates a pull

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,819
request to the game for example a

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,399
character and they don't know how to do

00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:52,290
that then they ask an another student

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
who's working on this task can come in

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,550
and say hey let's do this together work

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,950
together on this and they will not work

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,470
on the main repository but on the four

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:05,280
together so they learn how to set up a

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,050
project to invite other people and how

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,910
to actually make pull requests to

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,220
different repositories not only the

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,330
master branch of the mass of the main

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,940
repository and with this we can create a

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:21,020
more like a cooperative environment

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:23,010
where the students have each other so

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:28,710
actually I would like some more input

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:31,320
for example for kissing I'm kissing so

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,600
why is it so easy to contribute to your

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,170
project apart from the pull requests and

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,720
how how did you come up with this well

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,530
actually yeah so much I didn't come so

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,630
much up so much with the how easy it is

00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,210
that's mostly the students though

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,190
there's a lot of a lot of documentation

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,640
if you if you have a look like we are

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:57,030
about here like I don't know a small

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,710
part of the game and the students

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,480
themselves their task for editing

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,220
documentation and they added a lot of

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,190
documentation first the motivation and

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,080
the vision and then how to how to

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,350
contribute what makes a great

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,540
contribution and also tutorials if I

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,660
want to do this task how can I make it

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,180
easy and this way yeah

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,400
they enabled they've learned they

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,270
reduced the threshold for new students

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,150
to come in to contribute to the game

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,710
there's also some learnings so if

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:32,150
anybody has a question please always

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,150
erase the end oh yeah

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:39,480
umm what's the purpose of the game so as

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,980
I saw in the video I think you start on

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,020
one tire that's visible and start

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,820
running around and I imagine you are

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,010
looking for stairs or are you looking to

00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,350
get out of the turret but what's what's

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:56,970
the good is there an end goal or is it

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:58,680
just exploration yeah so so for each

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,020
student this the purpose is somehow

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,910
different so they add their tile to this

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,310
and they want others to explore the tile

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:08,670
and to see that and to have fun on this

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:11,550
so for example there's this living room

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,730
tile over here and there is a chocolate

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,260
room somewhere

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,960
and there was a task to create

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,760
dependencies between tiles so if you

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,530
enter the chocolate room and you go back

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,220
to the living room the living room turns

00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:27,190
into chocolate so it's something where

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,770
students can it's a discovery game

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,180
it's nothing where you can like say okay

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,680
this is the goal we'll go to the next

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,530
level of course you can go to next

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,110
levels but being in this one level and

00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,940
discovering it while you program it and

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,070
you see you can change it and be part of

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,430
this game that's this I think the

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:48,690
purpose the students and for me it's

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:52,690
creating a learning experience where

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:56,380
yeah but I have fun doing it but it's

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:59,350
not like like jumpin ranking live Super

00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,140
Mario where you need to achieve and you

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,480
get points students also say that like

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,930
we have the Move statistics for example

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,980
so you could count how much it takes to

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:14,020
reach the next level but that depends on

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:18,960
the students so I am just the one who

00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:21,420
created like these these ugly rooms and

00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:28,810
everything else was made by the students

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:30,220
also the web design yes yeah I might

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,230
have missed that because I just walked

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:36,190
in a few minutes late but can you

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:38,260
probably repeat again what about the the

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,160
ages these students were like the

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,170
background in general if if you'd

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,510
already talked about it I'm sorry but

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,300
yeah just to get a get another idea

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:52,650
okay good question so this is part of

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,330
Google coding which is an online

00:12:52,650 --> 00:13:00,310
competition and the ages are I think

00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:02,770
between 13 and 18 and I'm I didn't ask

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,240
what age they are when they contributed

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,300
I was just happy that they do I think

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,130
there are more contributors who are so

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,380
people who stayed longer and contributed

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,990
more are usually a little older than the

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:18,280
younger ones but that's the age range

00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:19,900
from my and and what's the sort of

00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,730
average background or what's the

00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,339
motivation for doing this is like an

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,009
involuntary project or was it in side of

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:30,610
some school project or do they sort of

00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:34,749
volunteer are they motivated in in the

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:38,680
first place to come already or so the

00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:41,499
competition could be a motivation but

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,240
actually the the ones who win the

00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:46,240
competition are mostly motivated by

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,329
contributing so when you for example

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,740
when you fulfill three tasks not only on

00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,230
this game but there are many many more

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:56,649
projects that were like sixteen thousand

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,199
tasks fulfilled and when you fulfill

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:00,579
three you get a t-shirt or something

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:12,279
like that or five I don't know there

00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:15,160
that's so thank you very much it looks

00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,709
like a really a nice initiative to

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,540
really motivate people with no

00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:22,569
experience or being so young as you

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:25,180
mentioned okay so yeah it looks really

00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:27,839
nice and like in general open-source

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,819
projects or many of them have this

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,649
problem that people feel afraid to

00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:33,459
contribute because of lack of experience

00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:36,249
so that's great

00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:38,740
so my question is on the contribution

00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:41,499
mode I think you mentioned in one of the

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,999
pages per programming so how does it

00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:45,550
work in a distributed environment

00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:47,139
because or maybe I'm assuming that

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:52,179
people don't know each other and are

00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:53,709
co-located this at the case so actually

00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:57,399
I don't know how the students interpret

00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:59,709
their programming might be that so I

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,139
think in some settings it's a school

00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:03,879
setting where there are classes working

00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:07,240
on Google coding so there it applies

00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:08,800
very well and in other cases I think

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,249
it's for them to find out and I don't

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,519
know but they could create a live chat

00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:17,740
for example where somebody types and so

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,689
of course for even lowering this

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,809
threshold we have a we have a chat there

00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:26,259
so people can just log in and ask hey I

00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:28,089
have no clue could you help me and so

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,720
that we also get the students from

00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,980
before creating this pull request

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,329
sometimes the pervious he gives to the

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,350
wrong place or they don't know how to

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:39,050
click so there's a chance

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,240
- yeah get them there and for pair

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,009
programming they somehow they they ended

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,779
chat they wrote like let's team up let's

00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,740
do something but I actually don't know

00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,380
how they did it

00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:53,680
okay so no specific tools apart from the

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,680
friendly chat okay thank you

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:05,060
so other any statistics on how what you

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,709
did may be contributed to students

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,920
contributing and having an easier time

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:13,300
yeah integrating themselves oh yeah

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,730
statistics let's see I think it's here

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,449
but it's the labyrinth is the third year

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,069
of Google codon where I participated and

00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:26,240
here's some statistics so and the the

00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:28,699
first the first two years we created in

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,389
another game which is called flappy SVG

00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:35,990
and when you have a look at it how it

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:38,750
changes so we had like six tasks and

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,000
there we have 20 in the labyrinth and we

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,670
had what is interesting to me like 25

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,250
percent of those people creating a pull

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:50,569
request they the pull request for closed

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:52,370
and we went down to 14 percent and we

00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:54,350
did this by actually changing the

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,329
process so it was not like changing the

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,699
architecture or anything of the code it

00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:01,610
was like how we relate to other to the

00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:04,159
students but we are accepting but we say

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,290
okay you you did this code yeah let's

00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:08,510
merge it in and they are like excited

00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,159
and then you can ask oh could you let

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,750
make a little change and make an issue

00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:16,880
for that and they can claim in your task

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:20,299
so yeah just being open to the students

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,630
and asking questions yeah it's the

00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:27,110
process that reduced the the waste so to

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:29,630
say and then of course you can see that

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,970
we went over to the labyrinth game so

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,669
and then we changed the architecture so

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:38,990
and flipy SVG there's one single file

00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:41,600
for everything and it's an SVG file

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:44,390
which you edit with Inkscape so whenever

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,980
somebody does a change method i that

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,470
changes and you have not conflicts no

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,570
you can

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,580
like if two people contribute in

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,330
parallel you most certainly get merge

00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:00,120
conflicts so by changing the process we

00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:02,850
get more merges and here the

00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:06,390
architecture there was the idea which

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,880
game is can we create where students can

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:12,030
create more characters where every

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,540
single part of the game can be edited in

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:17,520
many many many ways again so you can add

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,320
new floors again and again and again you

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,930
can create new music again again and

00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:28,830
again and new vaults new levels so as it

00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:31,170
reduces what we as mentors have to do

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,790
and the students can help each other

00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,400
more and there's this documentation

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,740
about what can be repeated in code to

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,880
get the people into the project it might

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,500
not be that great from a from an like

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,670
from a point of view where you say okay

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,860
I want to have it closed and

00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,510
maintainable but from a perspective of

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,820
learning it's great to have all these

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,970
tasks which can be done again and again

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:56,400
so you can onboard developers with on

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,140
already on board at developers who can

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,110
help each other and collaborate yeah

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:05,790
that's why we I think together with us

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:12,510
we also like increased increased the

00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:16,520
pull request merged per task so and yeah

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:21,630
and overall changing the architecture

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:25,860
created a for two times better like two

00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:31,140
times more contributions relating to

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:34,860
this other game and I calculated out how

00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:38,580
many students were added to google

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:45,120
code-in so that's inflation removed two

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:47,250
times by changing the architecture my

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,520
site about statistics we can also look

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:56,130
at how how many like what's interesting

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:59,330
to me is when I when I look at the how

00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:02,250
many how many contributors we have and

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,670
how many Forks we have that means oh

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,270
yeah

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:08,640
times over okay how many folks we have

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,830
we can say people want to contribute but

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,280
how many who want to contribute actually

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:17,100
can contribute and that's about final

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,340
half here or the other for such a

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,890
repository it's about also about half

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,770
and there are other projects which I

00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:28,049
worked on it's interesting for example

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:30,420
here are eight Forks and 13 contributors

00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:36,059
so that's kind of a different process or

00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:38,160
yeah or like 900 Forks and like 100

00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:40,770
contributors so having the the

00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,770
documentation and the ease of getting

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,720
into this already changes how many Forks

00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,960
and how many people actually get to

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:53,340
contribute from from having this idea to

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,970
contribute okay it's that time for

00:20:53,340 --> 00:21:04,770
questions should be so yeah of course we

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:06,020
are doing this by questions thread yeah

00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,610
let's do that

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:11,429
so if anybody has a question of course

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,210
I'm here and you can ask me thank you

00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:16,960
for listening

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,960
