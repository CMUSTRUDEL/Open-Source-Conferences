Title: #FOSSBack 18: Luciano Resende – A practical guide to bring your project open source
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Open Source Software has become the “de facto” standard in many industries, and with the popularization of collaboration platforms such as GitHub we have seen a big rise of newcomers and even enterprises getting involved and contributing their projects to Open Source. However, properly open sourcing a project requires you to have a good understanding of multiple areas such as software license, community building, public Ci infrastructure, etc. 

In this talk, we will go over a practical guide to take your project open source: we will explore how a software license influences what can be done with your project, we will dive into dependencies and license compatibilities, as well as share some best practices to help your project attract contributors and how to accept 3rd party contributions in a way that your projects can continue to perform open source releases as well as be incorporated into enterprise products and/or services. We will also touch a little on existing open source foundations and their process to accept new projects (e.g. Apache Incubator, Jupyter Incubator, Eclipse, etc).

	00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,129
so today we're going to be talking a

00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:11,350
little bit about like open source

00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:14,770
community leadership a little bit of

00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:16,150
like where I work and then basically go

00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:21,460
through these steps of like how you make

00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:23,980
a project open source who here have been

00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:28,020
working with open source for for like

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:31,150
more than a year have you guys actually

00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:39,790
put a project into open source or mostly

00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:43,960
like contributing into open source so

00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,460
who created a project okay so I think

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,020
this is gonna be very useful then for

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,649
for a lot of you guys we're gonna go

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,540
into like practical insights just about

00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:55,300
me and how to reach me you have my email

00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,910
Twitter and everything here I work at

00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,059
IBM in a group that does open source

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:04,780
I've been working on Apache for over 10

00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:07,469
years and currently working on big data

00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:13,060
platforms and a Jupiter notebook kind of

00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:14,950
stack in terms of like I just want to

00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,469
point here like sometimes we hear about

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,929
IBM and we don't associate that with

00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,340
open source I think we have been doing a

00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:24,130
lot of like contributions into open

00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,590
source we kind of a founder partner of

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:31,299
the Apache we have been contributing for

00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:33,789
lots of projects we have commuters in

00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:37,779
lots of projects we also participate in

00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:40,119
in lots of like steering committees that

00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:42,759
does open search this technology that

00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:45,849
gets implemented in open source we have

00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,439
open source advisory board and we have

00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:48,999
code day which is the group that I work

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,289
on which I'm gonna talk a little bit

00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:56,560
more in the next slide just here a

00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:59,679
little bit of like history of like how

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,709
it became to be code a I think iBM has

00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:05,289
been working on open open sort of AI

00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:08,590
technologies for a long time if you see

00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:11,370
some of the facts here like I think from

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:14,290
like if you guys saw the Space Odyssey

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,350
movie I think IBM was a technical

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,650
advisory there but then things like

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:26,860
when we the deep blue computer won the

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:28,930
chess game from actually Garry Kasparov

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,420
so like that's another kind of like big

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:36,040
event and more recently we saw like Joe

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:39,820
Pardy where Watson was able to kind of

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,570
win from the to kind of like most famous

00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,030
champions on that competition and we

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,390
kind of like don't want to get all of

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,940
these technologies or all these things

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,390
into kind of like a proprietary or

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,690
anything

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:58,210
so IBM create code date code aid

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:01,240
basically brings it stands for center of

00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,460
open-source data and AI technologies we

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,760
mainly work on open source technologies

00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:09,160
so we work very close with the IBM

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,620
research groups that has brought some of

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,350
these for example in the past and we are

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:18,120
contributing and making AI related

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:21,070
software available in the open source

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,530
and one of the main focus of the the

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,830
team is to kind of like concentrate on

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,890
on AI technologies to make it easier for

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,960
consuming and bring it to the enterprise

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,540
for those that may have heard about like

00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,890
spark Technology Center in the past code

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,190
a it's kind of an evolution of that

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:42,760
where we enhanced the scope and we start

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,640
not only working with data but also

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:50,890
applying kind of like dai aspects to

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:54,130
that kind of enough of that so let's

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,020
start about talking about open source

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,570
and I think the first question that we

00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,270
talked about like it's kind of like why

00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:04,690
to make your project open source and I

00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,250
think if you talk to different people or

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,350
if you talk to different organizations

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:12,640
you're gonna have kind of like different

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:16,359
answers I quote some some that I think

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,460
it's interesting here but like companies

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,350
might want to assert a meanness I want a

00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,880
particular area or technology so if

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,120
you're if you're starting something to

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,830
you as a company or just like for your

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,410
like making a better resume

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,270
you can then attach to like okay I've

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,120
been doing these contributions

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,850
people can see what actually how you

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,350
have done those and and all your skills

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,760
or your company if you're a company like

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,570
all the things that you bring into the

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,900
open-source community that serves to

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,790
promote technologies as well but I think

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,870
one thing that I'm also seeing that is

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:56,350
very often happening particularly on the

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,630
area like of big data and AI is that

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,480
things are evolving very quickly and you

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,150
really don't have like the time to kind

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,370
of like create a group of companies to

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,160
make a standard and things like that

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,780
I think the open-source projects are

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,610
actually becoming the de facto standard

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,100
so like for example for big data

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,380
distributing processing you see a lot of

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,530
people using spark there isn't kind of

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,810
like any standard that describe how

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,880
sparks should work in in multiple

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,950
limitation is basically everybody's

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,400
using the open source one and in other

00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:32,710
examples like for example tensorflow

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,930
into like more deep learning space and

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,090
other projects they all become the

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:43,180
de-facto and then like you see a lot of

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:47,230
like people using that so but then when

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:50,500
you start talking to people they

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,900
sometimes tell you okay I've put my code

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,550
into github that is open source and

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,490
everything you can go and use and you go

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,950
there there isn't like a license there

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,790
isn't anything that describe about the

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:07,240
project so making your code public

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:10,260
really is not like making your code kind

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,260
of like open source

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,880
so what really makes your project open

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,320
sirs I think the main characteristics of

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,070
like an open-source project when we talk

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,660
about a project is open source is like

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:32,550
based on the license study and imply

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:34,949
that is using and usually we have what

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,229
we call like the license that had been

00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:42,270
approved by the open source initiative

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:43,889
also like OSI that describes like a

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,840
prove-it license and those are mostly

00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,990
what we can see there open source and

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,030
you can see kind of like you have the

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,130
links here where you can go in and see

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,470
if I call the licenses we're going to

00:06:53,130 --> 00:07:02,580
talk about a little bit more of those in

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:04,260
the next slides so when you go to a

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,120
project and really to tell it the open

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,830
source and you want to make sure you

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,919
understand two things about the project

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,919
the project license the project license

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:19,050
is what it's going to tell you what you

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:23,639
can actually do with that code can you

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,990
for example distribute can you add into

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,150
like for example if you're building a

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,880
product in a corporation can you add

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,500
that piece of code into that what are

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,780
requirements that you need to do have to

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,520
make notice or or anything like that the

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,830
license is basically kind of like a

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,389
legal framework that describes what what

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,669
you can and what you cannot do with that

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:45,240
project you also want to take kind of

00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:47,669
like a look into the governance the

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,419
governor's kind of like provides lis you

00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:53,910
a social framework it tells you like how

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,199
for example decisions are made how kind

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,889
of like that the community is built

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,930
there how communities interact and it

00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:04,190
will enable you to understand better and

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,479
and contribute or just play with that

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,900
open-source project that you are working

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,900
on

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,930
let's talk a little bit about license

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:24,820
and kind of like how you choose a

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:27,580
license for your project so there are I

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,280
think mainly three categories of

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:36,640
licenses so like one that is a very

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,950
permissive and those kind of like as the

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,820
name kind of like nation it allows you

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:45,130
to do a lot of things with that you can

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:49,660
basically start incorporating even kind

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:52,480
of like a making a fork and dairy making

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,600
that completely new project based on

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,500
that so that is like like some examples

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,430
of that it's like the public domain MIT

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:06,310
BSD in apache license and in some of

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,500
those are mostly common and mostly kind

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:12,220
of like well accepted by corporations

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:15,630
when you try to identify a project that

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,000
you can consume into building products

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,530
there are also like the strongly

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,920
protective and those are more the

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:28,930
categories of like GPL GPL - GPL 3 and a

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,760
GPL and you kind of like need to be more

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,800
aware of those and kind of like what are

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,870
the restrictions of that so like for

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,970
example the GPL and LGPL if the GPL ones

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,160
if you for example gonna make a product

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,770
and you're gonna ship a product you most

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,930
likely gonna have to start like that's

00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,630
considered a derivative project and

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,260
you're gonna have to start making your

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,280
source code

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:57,640
kind of like available into the same

00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,500
type of license for example those might

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,480
be acceptable for certain types of

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,790
projects might not necessarily be

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:08,110
accepted for like corporations and and

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:10,180
things like that others like a GPL is

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,700
not only like if you ship a product but

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,120
like only if you even if you just put a

00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:19,360
service on the network that is already

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,610
considered like the the license being

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,980
kind of like applicable to those kind of

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,720
things so like where GPL you could

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,199
easily just put a service on the cloud

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,870
and that was not considered affected as

00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:35,860
a derivative work a GPL then enforces

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:38,800
that and then you have kind of like

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,350
weakly protected and weakly weak cop

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,649
left which is kind of like in the middle

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:47,800
and we still allows you to do some of

00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,629
the in corporations into projects that

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,550
that you might shape and things like

00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:55,689
that so derivative work I'm gonna be

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,930
talking a little bit more about

00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:01,779
practical steps from now for the scope

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:04,089
of the next steps I'll be considering

00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:07,240
the apache license and i'm gonna

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:11,050
actually talk up a little bit of like

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,600
details of like what different licenses

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,550
might might have it differentiation but

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,339
you're gonna see that are basically very

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,899
similar steps is just kind of like

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,089
licensed different license might have a

00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:25,589
different kind of text or different kind

00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:25,589
of like restrictions that you need to do

00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:31,569
so first think i think like if you're

00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:34,079
trying to bring your project to github

00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:36,689
or something choose the license

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,360
understand what the license kind of like

00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:41,769
implicates into your project that is

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,910
really when you're going to start kind

00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:47,500
of like making your project open source

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,480
for this context like let's talk about

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,370
the apache license oh like if you put in

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,559
a project and you want to make that an

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:56,170
apache license project first thing you

00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,019
have to do copy the contents of the

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,300
apache license into you license or

00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:04,809
license md file in the root of your

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,329
folder and then you're going to have to

00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:10,059
start looking to each of the files that

00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:12,670
you have and start applying kind of like

00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:15,699
the apache license header into the top

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:18,100
of the file as a command most of the

00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:20,110
files except that i think if you have

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,300
for example maybe a test file or not

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,750
they don't accept that that may be

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,009
acceptable but that gives you like a

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,720
kind of like assertion that like all the

00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:33,309
files have the proper license of the

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,170
proper copyright and kind of like the

00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:39,880
first step for you to start applying the

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:46,360
license so easy

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:52,090
right done who thinks I'm done here okay

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:55,320
okay well not not really yet so I think

00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:59,220
the the thing that you're doing here you

00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,420
defining the license for your project

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,940
once you define the license of your

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:11,200
project you have a list of dependencies

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:13,420
that your project kind of like uses - -

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,670
to actually build and you need to

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:20,350
understand kind of like a license

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:23,470
compatibility - and then evaluate every

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,810
single dependency and see if that kind

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,990
of like is okay with what you're using

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:32,830
so if we look here we can see that the

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:35,230
permissive are usually acceptable or

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,270
compatible with like weakly protective

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,970
and then are kind of like compatible

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:42,370
with strong protective but you start

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,280
seeing that the way backwards is not

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:48,010
really true so if you have a project

00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,690
that is apache license and you're trying

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:55,770
to and you have a dependence that is a

00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:58,930
pharaoh GLP those are not compatible and

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:01,810
you are not going to be able to ship a

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,360
product or ship a project that has that

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:07,450
type of license you have to then kind of

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,090
like start evaluating what are your

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,430
options you might be able to replace

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:16,540
that with some different implementation

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:18,520
or you then might have - then maybe

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,780
that's not an option figure out what you

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,360
have to do maybe switch it to a

00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,880
different license and evaluate those

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:30,940
kind of things and you have to do that

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:33,670
for kind of like every single dependency

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:38,230
that you have when we are doing this in

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:41,170
Apache usually what we'll do is on the

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,170
license file then we're going to start

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,500
updating that in listing all the

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:51,100
dependencies with the proper license

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:55,090
that it has so like for example if I use

00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:58,270
a a Dodge R & B dodge are that RMIT

00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:02,200
license I will at the bottom of the

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:05,710
license I'll then say MIT license files

00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,390
and I can start listing those if the

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,700
license has different copyrights or

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,590
specific copyright is copyrights I might

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,200
have like two entries and things like

00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:17,680
that so just as an example what the

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:20,560
benefits of that is that you then have a

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,780
single place where you can look into all

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,970
the dependencies and you can verify that

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:28,120
everything is okay instead of like

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:31,390
having to go into all the dependencies a

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,070
check off for for for a bunch of like

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,670
projects that you might not be aware of

00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:39,370
so it makes it much easier for for folks

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:43,090
to evaluate your project and to see if

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:46,360
those are okay to bring into a project

00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:48,550
that they have by the way I think if you

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:55,660
have questions I mean we'll have time so

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:58,270
you guys can ask so we're kind of the

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:02,260
state here that we have done our due

00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:05,200
diligence we kind of like think we have

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,670
all the license have evaluated all the

00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,460
dependencies or the license

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:11,430
compatibilities and we are ready to go

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:16,500
open-source and we are ready to start

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:19,090
accepting kind of like contributions but

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,790
at that point you still have to take

00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:25,620
other precautions as well when you start

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:28,510
receiving contributions from third party

00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,270
you want to make sure that for all the

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,850
contributions that you receive you

00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,500
understand what is the present

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,020
precedence of that contribution so like

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,730
is the person that is building making

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,640
the contribution is the person that can

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,930
make that homestead code but also you

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,480
want to make sure that you have

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:49,060
permission according to the licenses

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,340
that you are using that you can still

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:56,200
ship that code and you can still bring

00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:59,530
that into a product later on or or build

00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:03,400
derivative works of that what we do at

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:04,930
Apache we use kind of like a corporate

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,740
CLA if you kind of like bring

00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:10,300
the scope of like a corporation doing

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,300
donations are a set of employees working

00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,820
on or we have the ICL a which is kind of

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:19,180
like a individual contribution that is

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,580
kind of like an agreement that the

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,980
contributor will license that as an

00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:27,520
apache license and cannot now apache to

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,100
redistribute for individual projects

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,040
what I have seen people do is kind of

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,110
like a smaller version what this call

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,860
like develop developer certificate of

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,200
origin github allows you to kind of like

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,490
when you do a pull request which is kind

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,530
of like someone trying to do a

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,840
contribution to your project you can

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:52,060
have like a pull request template and

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,760
projects have been basically making a

00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,640
template where the certificate of origin

00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:02,380
is there and then every contribution you

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:04,540
can have basically a a track record that

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,960
this person contributed and they

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,390
asserted that he has he is the owner and

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,760
he has the ability to and he is giving

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:20,940
you permission to redistribute based of

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:20,940
the license that you have yes

00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:44,450
so I think four is so the question is do

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:47,840
we actually need a a license agreement

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:51,169
for the contribution or not so I think

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,210
for smaller contributions I'm gonna give

00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:57,880
some examples of the Apache and and some

00:18:53,210 --> 00:19:00,350
examples of like other places in Apache

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,639
for smaller contributions I think we

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:09,169
accept that you don't need to have an I

00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:12,559
CLA file we tend to expect that for like

00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:15,679
when you start becoming large or when

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,330
you're becoming very frequent and that

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,649
is a requirement when you actually

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:25,039
become a comida to a different extreme I

00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:29,289
have been I have worked in projects or I

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:34,870
have helped at projects that had like

00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:37,909
maybe 20 30 50 PRS kind of like on hold

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:43,429
because they haven't figured out what

00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:44,840
they need in terms of like licensure or

00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,549
any kind of like greement with the

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,909
contributor before accepting the pull

00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:56,269
request so I think it I've seen diff

00:19:51,909 --> 00:20:00,380
aspects I definitely think that to be on

00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:03,860
the safe side this is not something that

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:07,159
is gonna make any burden on the actual

00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:09,470
contribution so it should be okay to

00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:11,299
have particularly like if you're just

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:15,789
building your own project so it

00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:19,690
safeguards you as you try to make

00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:19,690
distributions later on

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:28,570
if you're an employee usually sign in

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,400
your contract that everything you sort

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:34,300
of create during your work is sort of

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,770
property of your company so I think it

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,990
could be a problem if you don't have a

00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:43,540
ççla sign for example that if it comes

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:46,540
to a fight sort of the company could say

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,370
we are well but this is ours you didn't

00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,350
have the permission to commit that so

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,570
please take it out and in the worst case

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,480
it could be an important part of the

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:59,470
project so it I think it's a good idea

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,440
to have something in place yes I think

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,450
you're more coming to like when you see

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,240
corporations you're seeing definitely

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:10,330
like more towards larger contributions

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,900
and that what we expect also different

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,860
places have different laws so like for

00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:20,050
example at California we kind of like on

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:24,910
our stuff like if for example we do we

00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:27,730
do in like our own time so yeah you can

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,340
get to all kind of like different

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,100
requirements on different place so it's

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:37,270
best if you have for like individuals

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:40,980
just the DCO for more like Apache things

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:47,770
I see lar ççla that enables you to

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:50,020
basically be on the safe side have you

00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,750
been dealing with software projects

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:56,980
which go more towards the more

00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:59,620
restrictive area like a GPL 3 and how

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:04,600
how's the point of intellectual property

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:09,400
playing in there I don't have a lot of

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:13,660
experience on that area mostly what I've

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,690
been doing is very permissive in terms

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:19,600
of like the projects that I contribute

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:23,320
mostly because they will be then

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,840
consumed and either ship it or serve

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:31,210
serve it as a service on a cloud

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:34,330
provider so those kind of like my

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:36,080
experience I think in general I think

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:39,970
when it goes more to things

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,909
like Linux Java and things like that

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,740
from time to time we see those big like

00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:47,840
patent rollers or like people just

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,320
starting suing each other and so that

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,730
that happens on that kind of like

00:22:50,320 --> 00:23:04,669
license but I don't have a lot of like

00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:07,929
experience on that area okay so uh next

00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:10,159
step once we have our code there I think

00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:14,510
really what's gonna make your project

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:18,799
successful is if you start making a

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:24,799
community some tips here of like how you

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:28,240
can actually do that so I tend to see

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:31,730
like contributions come as a life cycle

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:36,080
someone will start using your project

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:38,149
for some reason or other they will find

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,610
bugs or require kind of like

00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:45,799
enhancements then they start

00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:47,240
contributing either or and that then

00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,070
becomes kind of like sustainable

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,320
contributions because they are using

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:55,190
they find more bugs and they get they

00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,740
provide more enhancements but really to

00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,159
get people to start using I think you

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,929
need to have like three basic things

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,750
getting started guides you want to make

00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:10,179
it easy for someone to just come and use

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:12,529
your project some basic documentation

00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:16,820
once they start using and they need to

00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:19,340
do kind of like anything specific it

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:24,320
needs to go and be able to find there so

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:26,960
like documentation for api's and just

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,220
basic utilization of the projects for

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,419
integrating with your project for

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:34,610
example and then tests I think tests

00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,980
here I mean a lot of people will think

00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:40,190
that is just because you want to make

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:42,409
sure that your project works but I

00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:44,770
really tend to see tests as a second

00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:47,419
kind of like a type of documentation

00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,130
when you need more advancements in areas

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,259
or when you need to kind of like really

00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,559
see how things in

00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:55,330
work internally or be able to integrate

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,999
usually the tasks will give you very

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:04,980
detailed information about how to do

00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:08,289
that also to attract contributors I

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:11,019
think you want to be very welcoming and

00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:12,460
start mentoring new members if you come

00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:15,999
to a place and then you ask a question

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,070
or you send a very simple contribution

00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:21,940
and people start ignoring or not like

00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:23,369
even helping you it's very hard that

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,389
you're gonna start seeing that guy

00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:28,480
contributing again and again and again

00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:30,309
unless it's right really like it needs

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,659
from like a day job or something like

00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:33,759
that but it's if it's really like

00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:38,769
volunteer you're not gonna see those

00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:41,409
guys coming back and also maybe have a

00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:43,450
list of like Help Wanted or like

00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:46,330
beginners kind of like tasks or issues

00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:49,960
that help people that are trying to come

00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:53,019
and contribute to see areas that you you

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,029
as a understanding of the internals know

00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:57,399
that it's kind of like easy but also

00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:59,529
it's kind of like welcome expected or

00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:02,499
wanted so that that helps their

00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:04,749
contribution initial contributors kind

00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:11,610
of like get guided into edge areas you

00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:13,600
might want them to work in terms of like

00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:16,119
documentation so like some also

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,759
suggested topics I mentioned some but

00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:21,269
like build and installation steps like

00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:24,789
how you actually come in and do things

00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:26,830
contribution guidelines API

00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:30,279
documentation all those kind of stuff

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:32,649
help people to get and know how they can

00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:36,580
start using and contributing to your

00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:37,840
project in terms of like tools how do

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,759
you do that

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,200
Apache we have a whole bunch of like

00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,940
infrastructure you can have the website

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,740
and everything if you are just on github

00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,230
github has github pages where you can

00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,240
have Jekyll kind of like in markdown to

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:54,519
build that documentation you can also

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,100
have weak isn't to link into the

00:26:54,519 --> 00:27:00,029
repositories if you're building like a

00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:02,740
Python libraries or things like that

00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:06,940
there is a read the docs

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:09,670
you kind of like can use and that is

00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:13,150
kind of all these tools are like a free

00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:19,870
tube to public using an open-source

00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:22,990
usage so feel free to use that any

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:25,660
questions so we talked a lot about like

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:29,020
just bringing your open-source project

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,580
into github I'm gonna switch gears

00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:36,429
a little bit of like how you would bring

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:38,230
your project to Apache so why we want

00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:42,010
Apache I think we we talked a little bit

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:44,020
about like the importance license

00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,210
I think the apache license to that all

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,679
it's something that is very kind of like

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:52,050
well understood and accepted by

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,090
enterprises and corporations so it's a

00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:57,660
it's easy to to get as a patch lysis

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:01,270
project and then get it consumer into

00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:03,309
products and services but also the

00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:07,690
governance that Apache has is something

00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:12,300
that is understood by many people it's

00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:14,650
kind of like merit meritocracy based and

00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,910
it's acceptable like when you come and

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,890
say well I'm gonna do things that Apache

00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,410
they know how people how decisions are

00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:23,290
make how like people become commuters

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,940
and involved to like PMC members and all

00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,440
of those guys because we have a lot of

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:31,059
projects and a history of like more than

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,070
a 10 or or or I don't know 19 years or

00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:36,280
something so it's it's it's something

00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:38,380
that but also like the branding of

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,890
Apache helps you to start a tracking

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:45,700
community and in making your a community

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:49,050
around your your code how those projects

00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,790
get into Apache we have Apache Incubator

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,980
Apache Incubator it's kind of like the

00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:57,790
entrance for any projects that come into

00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:00,400
Apache and it has kind of like a main to

00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:03,850
goes to to kind of like when a project

00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,950
gets accepted so it wanna ensure that

00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,460
all the legal aspects of the software

00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,260
are kind of like done that like all the

00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,910
things that we're talking about

00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,530
licensing it as an apache license and

00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,260
then I call the dependencies are

00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:20,370
compatible and all those kind of things

00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:22,500
those are those criterias are met and

00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:26,490
want to make sure that you start

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:28,830
building a community around your project

00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,380
and mainly the idea is we want to have a

00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,960
diversity community at least kind of

00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:36,630
like three different independent or

00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,850
different organizations so that like for

00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:42,110
example if a company a that is

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:44,580
contributing to the project kind of like

00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:47,100
strategically change direction and it

00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,660
doesn't put a lot of efforts there we

00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,150
still have different peoples that can

00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:56,220
and continue with the life of the

00:29:51,150 --> 00:30:00,030
project the incubator PMC also kind of

00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:02,010
like provide mentors to those projects

00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,350
the mentors are kind of like responsible

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:07,380
to make sure that you understand all the

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:11,280
legal aspects you understand how you do

00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:15,450
things in a patchy way build your

00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:17,460
releases and also like an apache in

00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,590
itself gives you some of like background

00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,640
in terms of like a help on legal

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:27,210
community and different types of things

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,220
so it's a good thing to kind of get a

00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:33,900
foundation get an infrastructure and

00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:35,850
like a patchy around your project if you

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,669
want to start building a proposal we

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,799
have a very detailed guide but kind of

00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:43,169
like two things that you start to look

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,340
at the beginning is like look for a

00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:46,260
champion that is going to kind of

00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,750
present that project into the Apache

00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:52,020
Incubator and look to at least three

00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:55,080
mentors that will help you through the

00:30:52,020 --> 00:31:02,400
kind of like stage that you are in the

00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:05,820
incubator process in terms of like then

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,710
writing your actual proposal some of

00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,020
like best practices here or some things

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:12,059
that I've learned in the past so have a

00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,850
detailed description of your project I

00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:18,210
think that is given and then you will be

00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:20,610
very well familiar with that but start

00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:23,309
then highlighting some of the premises

00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:25,620
or potential integration with different

00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:27,299
Apache projects you start showing that

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,940
there are synergies and that you might

00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:33,300
have a better way of building a career

00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:37,590
see around that if you know about

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:39,990
dependencies some risks bring that up

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,290
front so like I've been part of a

00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:45,510
project that we knew that we had a

00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:48,660
licensed dependency on a component that

00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:50,880
which the license wasn't compatible with

00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,080
Apache we brought that up to the

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,290
beginning we knew that there's going to

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,300
be a risk we ended up being lucky that

00:31:55,290 --> 00:32:00,210
we working with the community and we

00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,100
were able to change the license to kind

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:05,400
of like a compatible license with a

00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:07,350
faction we were able to go up front with

00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,790
that otherwise we knew we were going to

00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:13,190
be in jeopardy of like not being able to

00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:16,880
graduate or or something like that and

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:20,280
try not to come into Apache just like

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,170
one or two commuters that just work for

00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:27,510
the same company and stuff like that

00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:29,430
tries you before you bring something try

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,990
to have a diverse set of like initial

00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:33,450
commuters try to do some collaborations

00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:36,510
with maybe a different company or a

00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:39,270
university or folks outside that maybe

00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:41,250
have the same interest that helps

00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:43,260
counting to towards kind of like a

00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:47,970
diversity around your project right from

00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:51,750
the beginning and this is mostly like

00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:55,140
kind of like a life cycle during

00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:57,330
incubation and serve more as a guide so

00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,590
you get the proposed incubator projects

00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:03,570
you can enter incubation creates relays

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:06,660
build diverse community and actually

00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:09,090
after a certain point you met all the

00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,440
criteria and you start graduating when

00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:12,720
you graduate you become what we call

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,860
like a TLP which is an official Apache

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,810
project otherwise you might kind of like

00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:25,370
not get to that as to that and it can

00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:25,370
retire or go to and don't graduate so

00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:32,580
getting around the end of my talk so

00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:36,660
like just a quick summary here so public

00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:38,610
code is not open source you really is

00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,670
all about the license and the governor's

00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,330
for your projects to to really like be

00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:47,680
kind of like

00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:49,270
a good open-source project we at Apache

00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,330
and I think in general we value a

00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:54,250
community over code so it's much

00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,590
important to have a community and get

00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:59,860
your project going then actually just

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:05,470
the code the code itself is just the

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:07,450
code and not really helpful and now I

00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:10,240
mean if you interested you know how to

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,680
get at least a high-level guidance of

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,200
like how you start to bring your project

00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:22,600
to Apache feel free to reach out to us

00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:26,280
yes and we'll have more details on the

00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,280
workshop tomorrow what time is your talk

00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:34,810
ok so just look for Justin's talk

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:39,010
he's actually the current IP MC chair at

00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:43,450
Apache so he knows all that you might

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:46,150
need to might want to know as well so

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:58,510
that's about it so I think if you have

00:34:46,150 --> 00:35:02,020
any questions yes ok question sorry a

00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:04,390
question I had was if you join the put a

00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,670
proposal project for the budget of the

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,980
foundation incubation what kind of

00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:14,470
support do you get in terms of hosting

00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:16,650
of the code CI compute capacity and that

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:21,090
kind of stuff very good question so uh

00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:23,830
the benefits that you get are Apache is

00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:26,530
mostly a lot of the things that you

00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:29,010
mentioned we will provide like for

00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:32,560
example hosting of your mailing lists

00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:34,840
the code is going to be provided at the

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,150
Apache kind of like github me for sure

00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:40,930
sorry get infrastructure and get

00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:45,160
mirrored to github we have internal sea

00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:47,170
ice machines we also have I mean a lot

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,650
of people that doesn't have a very kind

00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:53,320
of like requirement for a high capacity

00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,900
can use things like for example trav CI

00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,080
as well

00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,000
we also like provide kind of like a

00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,590
legal infrastructure in the sense of

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,570
like if you have questions about a

00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:07,350
specific license or about a specific

00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:10,260
contribution we will have you can ask

00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:12,480
the experts or you can kind of like

00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,240
excavate to like even like we have pro

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,800
bono lawyers that help sometimes if it's

00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,030
not something that we have handled in

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:25,140
the past so you get a vast amount of

00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:27,720
like helpful resources on those areas so

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,370
it that gives you kind of like in

00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,880
contrast with like just being at github

00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:39,300
it gives you a much more infrastructure

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:44,160
aspects or support to think we have one

00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:46,530
in the back yeah hi just a quick

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,910
question I'm quick comments I've been

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,610
working I'm a lawyer working with open

00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,350
source for 18 years now if you're doing

00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:55,020
the license declaration try and use SPC

00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:57,510
SPD X please it's the standard now for

00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:00,210
declaring licenses it meets machine

00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:02,280
readable and helps scanning and

00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,500
understanding what the license is it's a

00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:09,150
it's a XML format for declaring any

00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:11,790
information and it's SPD x.org and it

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,200
just says license identify F and two

00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,760
dots Apache or whatever it is and

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,260
there's there's license codes there this

00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,940
means if for example if someone's then

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,680
taking your code and building into a

00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,540
much larger package they can scan it

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,460
with scanners like force ology or

00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,690
Chinese scan and they can easily pick up

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,240
actually what that license is that

00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,830
license declaration it's it's so easy in

00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,130
in if you copy paste or use other

00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:34,590
people's license in the header files to

00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:37,020
make a complete mess of it and you know

00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:40,050
you say like LGPL 2.0 which never

00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,540
existed and things like this so SPD

00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:44,340
expert I do recommend this and second

00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,040
thing is if you are actually just saying

00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,420
doing the legal review there all sorts

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,890
of tools out there so you don't have to

00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:55,590
do I ball you can actually use a scope

00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:57,390
scanners like force ology on the source

00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,830
code and that should pick up most of the

00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,600
license declarations and help you sort

00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,100
all that information out and finally

00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,780
just a bit of a plug for tomorrow's

00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,390
workshop we have a legal compliance

00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,980
workshop in the morning where we talk

00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,960
about open chain and

00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,230
quartermaster which is a tool for a

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,140
workflow tool for automating and

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,850
supporting all this compliance work in

00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,300
larger packages obviously if you've got

00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:24,450
three dependencies is not really useful

00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:29,150
but if you've got 400 or 40 then it can

00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:29,150
be useful just a comment ok great thanks

00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:35,760
just a brief question if we want to

00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:37,320
publish an open-source project we

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,490
thought about well github is the place

00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,470
to go

00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,390
well how necessary is that to be

00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:44,130
somewhere there or just forced our own

00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:47,540
service and make enough advertisements

00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:55,320
through some channels like whatever yeah

00:38:47,540 --> 00:39:00,150
well I think where you go might not be

00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:03,150
the biggest problem but it's more like I

00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,640
want to make sure that if you're on

00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:08,760
github or if you are an Apache or if you

00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,350
are in a different place you you're

00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,080
doing the right things I think that's

00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:17,880
mainly my goal that you understand like

00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:20,610
the license you understand that if you

00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,260
make your code public and it's just you

00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:24,120
working there you're not building a

00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,340
community you're not making your your

00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,100
project really like so sex very

00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:33,180
successful and expanding that the usage

00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:35,010
so it's mostly to to get the right

00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,740
things get the license analyze the

00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:41,340
dependencies and make sure you start

00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:43,050
building a community you start going to

00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,670
that direction independent if you're

00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,070
just building at github or if you're

00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:49,740
building a tube to to a foundation or

00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:52,820
anyplace else I myself have lots of

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:56,250
projects that is just on github

00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:59,790
we as IBM we have projects that are in

00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:01,200
github we have projects that are at

00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,570
apache we have projects that we

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,600
contribute that are at linux foundation

00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:08,760
and you name it it's it's all over but

00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,290
it matters the way you bring in the

00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,040
software and contributing that in open

00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:16,800
source unfortunately we don't have any

00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,310
more time but thanks so much for the

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,150
questions and I'm sure you can ask

00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,369
Luciano

00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:26,910
at the lunchtime break in the sponsors

00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:29,510
area thank you so much for coming ok

00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,510
