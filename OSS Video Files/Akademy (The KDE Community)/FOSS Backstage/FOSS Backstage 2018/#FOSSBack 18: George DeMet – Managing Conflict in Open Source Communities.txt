Title: #FOSSBack 18: George DeMet â€“ Managing Conflict in Open Source Communities
Publication date: 2018-06-21
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Technology communities in general and open source projects in particular frequently suffer from a lack of diversity, with low participation rates by women, people of color, and other marginalized populations who are frequently targets of harassment and abuse.

This session will talk about the tools and techniques and approaches used by various open source communities to help support and maintain friendly environments for large and diverse groups of contributors from around the world.

We'll discuss how these communities manage conflicts and the various challenges they've faced while working to help keep their projects welcoming and inclusive places that support positive participation by all.

thank you for that introduction and

00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,500
welcome to managing conflict and open

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:16,550
source community one can hear me okay

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:19,400
excellent great so my my day job that I

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,460
get paid for is that I am the founder

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,770
and CEO of Palantir dotnet the dotnet is

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,740
important we're a full-service web

00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,330
agency based in Chicago and we work with

00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,559
a variety of different open source

00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:36,199
technologies but the reason I'm here

00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,480
today talking with all of you all is

00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:41,179
really more in the context of my

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,739
community involvement so we've been

00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,929
working with open source I've been

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:49,940
working with open source for 20 years

00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:52,129
now and and I don't know how to code you

00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,069
really don't want me to write your

00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:57,079
module or anything like that the last

00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:59,600
time I was really useful in terms of web

00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,870
development was around the time when we

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,850
still needed Internet Explorer 6 support

00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:08,600
so that's not how I contribute to open

00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:10,969
source I volunteer my time in a variety

00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,920
of different ways focused around the

00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:16,219
people side of open-source so around

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,789
community around governance things like

00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:21,740
that and for the last few years I have

00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:23,479
chaired the Drupal community working

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,310
group so we're a volunteer group

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:27,710
chartered by our project lead that's

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,750
responsible for upholding the Drupal

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,329
community code of conduct and helping

00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,210
mediate conflicts that arise so Drupal

00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:37,100
if you're not familiar with it is one of

00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,409
the world's largest open source projects

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,479
we have over a hundred thousand active

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,920
contributors it's an absolutely enormous

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:48,590
community Drupal is used by millions of

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,899
sites all around the world and and the

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:55,219
project has been around for about 15

00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:57,289
years over 15 years now and over that

00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:59,869
time we've gone from being this kind of

00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:03,460
small hobbyist community to this really

00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:06,740
large project that's used by you know

00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,539
enterprises at every level as well as by

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,369
people for their personal blogs so it's

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:14,060
a really amazing community to be a part

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:16,880
of and along with that growth right

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,740
we've had some growing pains right so

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,080
Herbal has grown progressively more

00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,950
complex with every major release the

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,970
time between releases has increased and

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,340
more is being asked the developer

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:33,680
community by customers and end-users

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:35,360
right so as a result we've seen this

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,200
kind of increased stress this Inc

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:43,190
increased pressure which results in

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,600
frustration and conflict right it's

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,280
something that occurs in every open

00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,590
source project but it's really when you

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,840
kind of get to that growing pains place

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,760
right where you're no longer kind of a

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,110
bunch of people who are all know each

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,300
other and coming together to build a

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,010
project where you're all this enormous

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,400
project with people all over the round

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,590
the world that you start to really see

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,520
you know some of these issues so this is

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,410
from a 2016 survey that we took of

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,570
Drupal contributors asking them about

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,820
their experiences during the Drupal 8

00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:18,530
development cycle Drupal 8 came out at

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:20,240
the end of 2015 so over 60 percent of

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,840
respondents had experienced or observed

00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,910
conflict and this is actually fairly

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,030
consistent with the results that we see

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,230
from other open source projects so last

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,300
year the folks at github

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,820
conducted a survey across hundreds of

00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,500
different open source projects which

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,750
found that 18 percent of respondents

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,520
have personally experienced a negative

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,220
interaction with another user and open

00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,940
source but half of witnessed one between

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:52,490
other people so this is a problem that

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:54,230
we're all dealing with now I want to be

00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,270
really clear that the ability to

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,480
exchange ideas with others is a big part

00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:03,400
of what makes open-source great right

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:06,080
and not all conflict is bad right

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,970
positive respectful disagreements where

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,100
people are actually listening to each

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,860
other and seeking to find common ground

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:16,310
can contribute to a cross-pollination of

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,200
ideas challenge existing preconceptions

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,000
and help people find creative and

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,880
innovative solutions to problems and

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,520
generate innovation right that's what

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,370
makes open-source so awesome and sets it

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,650
apart from so many other models for

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,580
developing software

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:36,130
the problem is when people don't feel

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,660
like they're being heard they don't feel

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,699
like they're being listened to her that

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,500
their contributions are being valued

00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,350
right or that their interests aren't

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,660
being represented or that they feel hurt

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,380
by something that someone else said or

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:53,260
did right and and fundamentally conflict

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,720
is about unmet needs right

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,300
this negative conflict so what we want

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,300
to try and do is address these issues

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,400
these problems so that people feel even

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,800
if they don't agree with a decision that

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:10,870
was made that they've been heard and

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,940
that they are part of a community so

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,550
some of the kinds of issues right that

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,280
manifest all the time in open source

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,350
right many of these will pry seem very

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,720
familiar to many of you write technical

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,060
disagreements that turn into personal

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,400
attacks you know well you only want to

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,310
do that because it benefits your your

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,500
company or agency or you you've always

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:37,210
been against this solution because it's

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,530
my idea whatever right frustration with

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,370
the amount of time that it takes to

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,200
review patches in Drupal we have project

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,990
applications had to go through a gateway

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,120
for a while and that was a caused a

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,700
tremendous amount of frustration folks

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,680
felt that there were artificial blockers

00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,150
to contributing or if they contributed

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,000
something it would take a really long

00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,400
time for someone else to look at it and

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,580
review it and you know provide feedback

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,770
and that is an intense form of

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:10,479
frustration people just for any of the

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,180
you know above reasons or for others

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:18,130
just lashing out you know and the issue

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:22,270
queues venting their frustration you

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:25,410
know ragequitting you know I literally

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:29,229
before this you know right before this

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:31,750
session started we got a report just

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:33,130
like one of these where someone was

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,110
really upset that they weren't getting

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,789
the technical support that they were

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,750
looking for and they're like well this

00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:42,250
is why this project sucks right and then

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,470
finally we'll talk a little bit more

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,900
about this later a little more

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:50,830
harassment and trolling on social media

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:55,360
and in slack write or IRC if your if

00:06:50,830 --> 00:07:02,290
your project still uses IRC or use a

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:05,110
sorry sorry still uses IRC or uses one

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:10,330
of the other open source alternatives to

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:12,730
slack right regardless of the tool you

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,310
use there there is harassment and

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:21,940
trolling and personal attacks and other

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:26,110
issues that manifest so the consequences

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,540
of this right obviously we have a

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,200
decline in contributor morale people

00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:34,860
don't really feel like contributing if

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,240
everyone's fighting all the time which

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:42,010
also results in a decline in

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,630
productivity in the project lead to

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,300
people leaving the project when we go

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,340
back to that github survey I said the 21

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,930
percent of people who experienced or

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,640
witnessed a negative behavior said that

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,620
they stopped contributing to a project

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,740
because of it and when you keep in mind

00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,480
that that's over half the people who are

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,520
who are experiencing or witnessing

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,410
conflict and 21 percent of them end up

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,860
leaving that's a big problem that's a

00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:11,620
huge drain on on any open source project

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,170
and then people might you know choose

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,630
not to join a project right if a project

00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,880
has a reputation for being a place you

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,340
know with a toxic atmosphere where

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,900
people are fighting all the time then

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,600
they're going to be less interested in

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:31,090
being a part of that and then ultimately

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,370
this has an impact on diversity right

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,990
and so some of these I'm not going to go

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,270
into too much detail on these that if

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,340
you were at the diversity panel earlier

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:43,090
today they went into some of these

00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:45,640
numbers you know but essentially

00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,950
according to github only 3% of open

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:52,390
source code contributions are made by

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,540
women in Drupal we measure about 6% of

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,340
the recorded contributions or by women

00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,390
and even at our in

00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:03,460
person events like DrupalCon we're lucky

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:07,930
if we can get 20% women in attendance

00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:10,240
right so there are I think this is

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,790
really hard to measure unless you're

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,050
just measuring code but I think one of

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,580
the key points I want to make is that

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,350
there's lots of different ways to

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,090
contribute to open source that are not

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:23,950
just about code there is literally I did

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,910
a ton of research on this I've talked

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:30,310
with a few folks there is no good data

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:34,150
on representation and open source by

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:35,530
people of color there I think may have

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:40,620
been some studies that were done about

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:43,660
15 years ago but we really don't know

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,540
because you know we can kind of guess

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,190
when we look around rooms and we you

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,380
know talk with people and we see who

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:54,850
shows up at conferences that people of

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:56,680
color are very often underrepresented 16

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,960
percent of the people in github

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,240
open source survey identified themselves

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,940
as racial or ethnic minorities in the

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,890
country that they live in if we apply

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,930
that to the United States where I'm from

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:13,390
that about 35 to 40 percent of the

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:17,580
population identifies as a minority so

00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:19,270
that tells me that you know we have a

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,010
disproportionate under-representation

00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,870
there but this is one of those places

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:27,190
where more research is definitely

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:29,410
required what we do know is that women

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,660
are far more likely than men to

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,210
encounter language or content that makes

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,030
them feel unwelcome as well as

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:40,840
stereotyping and unsolicited sexual

00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:43,020
advances right and unsurprisingly as a

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,660
result that means that women are also

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:49,020
more likely than men to seek out help

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,700
directly from people they already know

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,830
rather than ask for help from strangers

00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,080
in a public forum or channel right and

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,940
if you think about it right

00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,010
collaboration between strangers is again

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,430
one of open sources most remarkable

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,780
aspects right so what we need to do is

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,220
strive to build a community where

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:10,840
everyone feels welcome to participate

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,550
and you know and again the impact of

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,830
is highlighted by the fact that on

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,080
github but pull requests by women are

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:20,710
actually more likely to be merged than

00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,720
those made by men but that's only true

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,340
if their gender can't be identified from

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:31,060
their profile this was a study that

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:32,920
someone did and open-source work is an

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,600
incredibly important way for people to

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,680
build their professional reputation

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,480
right half of contributors say that

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,770
their open-source work was somewhat or

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,080
very important in getting their current

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,330
role open and him so improving

00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,330
contributor representation can help

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:53,730
create a more representative tech sector

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:57,190
overall even beyond just open source so

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,770
this is the big point right reducing

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,440
negative conflict helps make open source

00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:05,230
more welcoming more inclusive and more

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,390
innovative so how do we go about doing

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,520
that right so a lot of open source

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,620
projects have codes of conduct right and

00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,350
it's very simplest form a code of

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,990
conduct is a policy that's used by an

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,700
organization to establish standards for

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,170
behavior and appropriate conduct when

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,480
interacting with others in a defined

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,180
space right whether that be a conference

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,640
a workplace project event venue this

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,110
conference has a code of conduct most of

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,240
the projects that you work on have a

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,700
code of conduct most of the events you

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,870
go to associated with other project with

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:43,030
projects have a code of conduct so in

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:46,420
the context of a virtual community right

00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:49,060
as opposed to a physical space codes of

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,670
conduct are designed to help create

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,010
inclusive places where people can feel

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,310
safe and welcome to contribute and again

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:59,620
the research shows us that documentation

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:02,260
that clearly explains the project's

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,270
processes such as contribute

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,100
contribution guides and codes of conduct

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,220
are valued more by groups that are

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,400
underrepresented in open-source

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:14,590
so a well-written and well implemented

00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,270
code of conduct and help address some of

00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,970
these issues right by making it clear

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:23,020
that the community does value openness

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,700
does value diversity and are committed

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,450
to providing inclusive

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,590
that's free of harassment where people

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:36,370
are welcome to contribute in a

00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:38,530
professional manner so now to be really

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,930
clear just having a code of conduct does

00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,940
not get rid of every issue right but

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,770
what it does is it sets the ground rules

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,500
right and make sure that everyone

00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,000
understands the values of your community

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,450
and the ground rules for interacting

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,640
with others right so the contributor

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,730
covenant and the citizen code of conduct

00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,760
are fantastic starting points there are

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,610
lots of other good codes of conduct and

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,310
code of conduct models out there there's

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,350
Jango project code of conduct which has

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:12,790
also been adopted by the jQuery

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:15,670
foundation and others of course right

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,860
here's the big caveat right code of

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,440
conduct is worthless if there's no

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,140
structures to support it or mechanisms

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,700
to enforce it so different projects

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,420
again handle this in different ways

00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,070
right

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:32,590
so sometimes it's the responsibility of

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:34,330
one of the projects maintainer x' or an

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,040
existing group such as a technical

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,920
working group so examples of this would

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,500
be Ruby on Rails or kubernetes right

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,110
where it's very tightly tied to the

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,340
folks who are in charge of the project

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:51,160
overall in projects with a strong

00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,960
corporate sponsorship or oversight it

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,300
might be handled by an employee of the

00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,370
company or a professional community

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,410
manager who's hired specifically for

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,960
that purpose so some examples there

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,270
would be Mozilla Microsoft and Google

00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:09,010
for the open source projects that they

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:10,780
run or it could be a dedicated group

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,290
made up of volunteers from the community

00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:18,960
right so that would be some examples

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:22,330
there jQuery Jango and of course Drupal

00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,160
regardless of what the model is ideally

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,810
you want to have multiple people who are

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,760
empowered to handle code of conduct

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,590
reports you need to have these people

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,410
fully understand and appreciate the

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:34,150
responsibility that's involved as well

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,640
as be folks who other members of the

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,410
community can feel safe talking to and

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:43,389
can trust to handle any reports

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:44,620
they make with discretion so I'm going

00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,440
to talk a little bit about what we do in

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,019
Drupal because that's what I'm very very

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:54,269
familiar with so we have the Drupal

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:56,800
community working group there are

00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:57,939
between four and six of us on the group

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,720
at any one time

00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:05,199
we are an all-volunteer body we have no

00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:09,250
staff we have no resources we have no

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,529
legal representation we do not have a

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,259
formal relationship with the Drupal

00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:16,629
Association which is the nonprofit that

00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:19,329
is responsible for the drupal.org

00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:21,879
website the events and some of the other

00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:23,769
things associated with the project we're

00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,470
an independent group that is chartered

00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:30,339
directly by Drees Boy tart the project

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:33,129
lead so he appoints or approves its

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:35,529
members and if somebody appeals a

00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:39,819
decision that we make he would be the

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:41,889
designated person to review that so we

00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:43,839
have a couple of primary chartered

00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:46,810
responsibilities

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,920
we're chartered to uphold the community

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:53,800
code of conduct help resolve conflicts

00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,930
between community members and maintain

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,930
documentation and processes related to

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:02,139
community health there's some certain

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:04,380
tension actually between these primary

00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:07,059
chartered responsibilities because

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,120
upholding the code of conduct kind of

00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,620
puts us in an enforcer role

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,110
whereas helping resolve conflicts

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:17,319
between community members puts us in

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:19,809
more of a mediator role and so this is

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:22,089
something that's been a little bit of a

00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:24,459
challenge in terms of how we work with

00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:26,650
community members understanding the

00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,870
context in which we are talking with

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,600
them about an issue right because

00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,520
sometimes it will be a hey you did this

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,860
thing and it was really not cool and we

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,380
need to talk about it and sometimes it's

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,030
like hey I see you two are having a

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,450
disagreement and it's getting a little

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:45,280
heated let's talk it out right and folks

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,600
especially in the heat of the moment

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,820
don't always understand which context

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,250
were approaching that conversation so

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,840
it's

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:59,390
important for us to be clear about that

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,860
we do other things too because you know

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,220
honestly those of us around the

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:07,220
committee we care about our our our

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,160
community greatly and we want to help it

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,200
be the best that I can so you know one

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,910
of the things we do is we recognize and

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,150
support community leadership we give out

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:19,670
an annual reward to folks you get a free

00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:23,290
of really cool little trophy and you get

00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:27,110
a free pass to the DrupalCon conference

00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:28,790
and it's it's nominated by members of

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:33,110
the community for somebody who shows

00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:35,060
kindness and a a above-and-beyond

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,760
dedication and devotion to the community

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,500
and we've been able to recognize some

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,900
truly wonderful people and it's it's

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,420
it's really great to see that kind of

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,950
recognition for folks who are doing

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,690
something to helping make the community

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,620
and the project better in a way that

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:54,020
goes beyond just contributing code we

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,030
provide resources consultation in vice

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,070
sometimes someone will come and be like

00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,050
hey I'm wrestling with this problem I

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,330
don't necessarily have a report or an

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,210
issue that I want to file I just am

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,340
looking for some advice and so we'll

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,030
provide that to the extent that we can

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,590
and then of course right sharing which

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,150
is kind of what I'm doing today right

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,160
sharing the experience and best

00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:19,940
practices that we've learned with folks

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,010
from other open source projects and this

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,770
is something I really want to see more

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,500
of in general so I'm really happy that

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:34,280
we have this venue here today to be able

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:38,030
to do that so this is a lot of stuff to

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:41,000
do this work is really complex it's

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:44,450
really time consuming and very often

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,290
it's emotionally draining and it is it

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:53,840
is a lot for for a volunteer group to do

00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:58,090
but somehow we muddle through so I love

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:02,360
this quote by bell hooks of who's

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:04,310
American author and scholar she says for

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,260
me forgiveness and compassion are always

00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,570
linked how do we hold people

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,430
accountable for wrongdoing and yet at

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,020
the same time remain in touch with their

00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,150
humanity enough to believe in their

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:19,010
capacity to be transformed right and

00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:22,190
this is kind of the frame that we try to

00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:25,100
approach conflict and issues in our

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:31,010
community right we don't think of

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:36,500
ourselves as the Drupal police right we

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:38,390
don't our role is not to decide who's

00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,480
right and who's wrong in a given

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:44,120
situation as much as it is about helping

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,520
people in our community work together in

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,440
a mutually respectful way and to take

00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,940
responsibility for the impact of their

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:56,320
words and actions right and I mean yeah

00:20:52,940 --> 00:21:00,200
and and so usually it's it's not about

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:03,680
what you said was wrong so much as hey

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,530
what you said had this impact on someone

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,290
else and it's important to understand

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:11,900
that and and to own that and to the

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:15,710
extent possible take responsibility for

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:18,020
making it right we want people to have

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,470
as much control over the outcome of

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,390
their dispute if they're in conflict as

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:27,020
possible while still maintaining a safe

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:31,460
and welcoming community and this is hard

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:34,910
because you know very often the very

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,250
natural reaction is hey someone said or

00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,320
did something that really hurt me and I

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:43,280
want them to pay I want them to be

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:46,100
punished and that's not really what

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,720
we're set up to do if somebody does

00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,950
something that's really wrong and they

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,010
need to be removed

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:54,530
we have no qualms about doing that but

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,930
if it's a dispute that can be settled

00:21:54,530 --> 00:22:01,310
between two people we're gonna do our

00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:05,330
darndest to find a way to do that so a

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:08,840
big part of this is about process right

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:12,230
so unless an issue requires immediate

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,270
action our process is designed to enable

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,250
resolutions that are as thoughtful and

00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:19,430
as permanent as possible as opposed to

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,160
reacting quickly based on emotion and

00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,220
this

00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:27,360
that it can be take a long time it can

00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:29,970
be drawn out right and I think one way

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,240
to think about it is when you have

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,740
people who are maybe at a bar who are

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,750
about to get into a fight because

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,420
they're really upset at each other for

00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,670
one reason or another and sometimes what

00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,590
you need to do is just kind of get these

00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,180
people outside and separate them from

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,270
each other and talk them down a little

00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:52,980
bit when we can do that that's what

00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:56,040
we're going to try and do so so when an

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,200
issue comes in to us right what we'll do

00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,250
is we'll gather as much information as

00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,230
possible from all the involved parties

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,000
we in order to ensure that people are

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,860
able to share their stories with us and

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,780
then open and honest or we don't share

00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,490
any names or other sensitive details

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:15,270
outside the group without permission

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:17,100
right so once we have that kind of

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,640
sufficient level of detail to get

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:24,120
started we meet as a group we have

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,430
weekly meetings on hangouts our group is

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,530
distributed we have folks in the United

00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:30,120
States we have folks who are based in

00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:34,710
South America we have folks who are

00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:36,060
based in the UK and Europe and so we get

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,580
together once a week we also have a

00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:41,430
private slack channel that we that we

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:44,520
maintain and can communicate in between

00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,200
meetings and then we decide what to do

00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,270
with the issues that are in front of us

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,810
right that we have enough information we

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:53,940
may decide to do nothing right if we

00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:57,480
think that someone is filing a report in

00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:00,660
bad faith or if they're it's outside our

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,000
jurisdiction as a group we may decide to

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,890
just go back to the reporter and say hey

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,020
we're not going to take any action on

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:12,660
this and here's why right we may offer

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:15,480
suggestions for those involved to try

00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:18,740
and resolve the issue themselves right

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,360
rather than intervening directly

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,950
sometimes we do need to do mediation

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,420
that can take the form of we're going to

00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,580
talk with one party we're going to talk

00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,560
with the other if we think it makes

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,550
sense we may then have them talk with

00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,610
each other with one of us present

00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:38,550
sometimes that works sometimes it

00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:39,990
sometimes we you know the best answer is

00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,780
for them not to interact with each other

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:49,950
but sometimes we can actually make it

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:52,200
work and that's nice so in the cases

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,930
where there's a clear code of conduct

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:58,080
violation we'll talk with the person or

00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:59,790
persons who engage in the violation to

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,920
help them understand the impact that

00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:05,580
their words or actions had and if

00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,650
necessary we will recommend permanent or

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,890
temporary bans from various community

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:14,450
spaces so again because we're not part

00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:19,650
of the Drupal Association we don't have

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:22,950
legal jurisdiction or control over you

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,900
know user accounts on drupal.org or

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:28,170
whether or not someone is allowed to

00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,780
come to one of our events but what we

00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,520
can do we have very good relationships

00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,320
with the Drupal Association and we can

00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,260
go to them and talk with them and say

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,810
hey this happened and this is why we

00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,690
think this person should be banned from

00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:45,000
an event or why that their user

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,400
privileges on the web site should be

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:55,350
revoked and then they will take the

00:25:47,400 --> 00:26:01,620
appropriate action so you know in some

00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:03,600
cases where we have where we have issues

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,280
where there's there's someone for

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:11,850
example who who might be get upset in

00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,920
the issue queues a lot and be show their

00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,870
frustration in unproductive or

00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,690
non-productive ways right

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:21,000
sometimes what we can do is is intervene

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,740
with that and when we receive them of a

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,450
variety of multiple reports right

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,820
sometimes what we need to do is go to

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,970
that person and and help them understand

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:32,100
and take responsibility for the fact

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:35,000
that hey you know when you yell at

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,260
people it has an impact on them and

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,460
let's see if we can find some better

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:43,830
ways to communicate feedback so that you

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,540
can be a more effective contributor you

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,210
don't have to spend your time dealing

00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,029
with all of these reports that

00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,380
people are making and you can actually

00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:56,090
help others become more effective

00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:58,039
contributors as well so again sometimes

00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:01,520
that works sometimes it doesn't but we

00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:03,980
think it's worth the effort to try in

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,440
some cases we might receive an

00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:09,080
after-the-fact report about a situation

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,880
that's already been resolved in those

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,590
cases we review the incident decide

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,870
whether further action is necessary and

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,610
keep it on file for reference just in

00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,620
case something similar comes up in the

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:22,669
future involving you know one or more of

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:26,179
the same folks well most of the issues

00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:28,730
that we tackle come from issues that are

00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:31,279
reported to us our process is not

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,929
exclusively complaint driven we're all

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,419
active and engaged members of our

00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:37,549
community and if we think that if we see

00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:39,169
something that we think needs to address

00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:45,830
we'll put it on the agenda and talk

00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:48,559
about it as a group so over the last few

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,360
years we've learned a few lessons we've

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:56,299
learned a lot of lessons here's a few of

00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:58,659
them one is that when we're in the

00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:03,710
conflict resolution or mediation process

00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:07,039
it's really important to manage

00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:09,679
expectations and make sure that all

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,919
involved parties agree to accept the

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:18,140
outcome of the proposal we can't always

00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:20,330
assume good faith and you know if folks

00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:24,169
agree to go through this process of

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:26,630
mediation they can't just get to the end

00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:28,850
of the process inside well you know I

00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:31,850
don't like that advice I'm going to

00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:37,010
ignore it at that point then we need to

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:39,830
take additional action escalation and

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:42,770
appeals need to be well defined and well

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:45,649
documented you know particularly when

00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:47,390
you're dealing with a conflict chances

00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:50,299
are that that one or both parties was

00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:53,750
not going to like the outcome of that

00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:55,490
and and if they do decide to appeal it

00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:58,330
needs to be clearly understood what

00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,330
their options are

00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,489
using discretion when deciding what

00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,809
details to share publicly this is a very

00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:09,039
challenging one because you know then

00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:10,720
one of the things that Denise said in

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,210
her keynote this morning right was that

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,769
like transparency was the lifeblood of

00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:19,389
open source and sometimes we can't be in

00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:23,019
this work sometimes we can't be

00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:26,259
transparent because doing so would harm

00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:28,029
others or would undermine trust making

00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:30,759
it less likely for people to tell us

00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:34,720
when things are happening on the flip

00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:38,190
side in some cases not sharing certain

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,259
details can also have the same effect so

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,720
we need to be really careful and this is

00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:46,149
highly dependent on the type of

00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,460
situation what's going on

00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:51,159
but we need to be able to so one of the

00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,109
things that we do in our in our report

00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,129
so we put out anonymize public minutes

00:29:53,109 --> 00:30:00,340
and say hey we dealt with this issue

00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:03,009
this is roughly what it involved and we

00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:06,220
try to word that in a way that unless

00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,509
you were one of the folks who witnessed

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,859
or was directly involved you're not

00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:13,419
going to necessarily know who it was

00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:15,609
about here's what happened here's the

00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:20,440
action we took that's really hard to do

00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:22,960
and we don't always do it well one of

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,509
our buyer colleagues on cwg was at an

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,039
event last week and you know was talking

00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:28,210
us through with with some folks at a

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,419
session there and got some really good

00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:34,269
feedback so I think we know how to make

00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:36,759
our minutes clearer of course we also

00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:39,549
have a non public version of our minutes

00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:42,999
that we keep where you know we're able

00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:46,080
to to see and talk about exactly who was

00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:50,519
involved in what happened in more detail

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:55,090
alluding to what I said earlier this is

00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:58,179
intense emotional labor so we have to

00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:02,320
remember to practice self-care we work

00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:05,859
we have to work really hard to mitigate

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,850
or prevent burnout this is really hard

00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:13,080
work and you know the reality is that

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,080
you know maybe

00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:17,770
this is something meet someone who could

00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,450
maybe do for a year to a little bit

00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:23,710
longer if you're a cold-hearted bastard

00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:26,290
like me but it it is really hard work

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,750
and it it does require being able to

00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:30,550
know when to say look I need to step

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,230
back I need to take a break for a little

00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:37,270
bit so I can come back with fresh

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:39,520
perspective and then of course one thing

00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,430
we've definitely learned and I think

00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,070
this ties in to the point I made on the

00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:48,430
previous slide about about transparency

00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:50,140
is that even if we can't talk about the

00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:52,510
specific incidents or the specific

00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:55,330
people involved we always need to be

00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:57,910
communicating our purpose or scope and

00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:00,340
and our process is how we do things to

00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:02,470
the wider community and so this is

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,440
something that we started to do we when

00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:09,070
we're able to we go to local events

00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:11,650
meetups and camps we talk there we have

00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,660
a session at the at the Drupal

00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:17,200
conferences the one in the US and the

00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:20,020
one in Europe so folks our folks are

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:24,580
able to find out who the heck we are

00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:26,800
what we do and how we do it so I'm gonna

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:30,070
talk a little bit about some of the kind

00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,070
of hot-button issues that we've been

00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,570
struggling with over the last

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,630
particularly last couple years one is

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:39,790
online harassment which is just really

00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:45,220
exploded as an issue for us in the last

00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:46,690
couple years and so there are some

00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,930
people who feel that no matter what they

00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:52,570
say or do outside of a project space

00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:56,080
only their behavior inside the project

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:58,180
space should matter this is a hot-button

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,910
issue but but to me it's it's pretty

00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:05,170
clear right if you're harassing and

00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:07,330
attacking people on social media you

00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:09,760
can't then turn around and expect to

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:13,480
collaborate productively with those same

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,490
people on the project right so so I

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,130
think this is something that we need to

00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:20,440
clearly be thinking about as projects is

00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,840
not just what's happening in our queues

00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,870
what's happening you know with our

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,040
issues but like what's happening the way

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,930
that individuals

00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,600
who are participating those projects are

00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,580
interacting outside of it so maybe

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,170
really clear this is not a matter of

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,020
free speech or political correctness

00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:40,510
this is about treating those around us

00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,400
with basic human dignity and respect

00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:44,920
right

00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,530
so the shared values of our code of

00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,900
conduct apply regardless of what your

00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:52,540
personal political social religious

00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,370
views are but they're not an excuse to

00:33:52,540 --> 00:34:00,700
avoid accountability for your words and

00:33:54,370 --> 00:34:03,130
actions so as someone who's responsible

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:07,960
for upholding a code of conduct it's not

00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:10,090
always easy to identify what the trolls

00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,800
are and to hold them accountable

00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,990
particularly if they're hiding behind

00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:18,100
anonymous handles or working in

00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:20,980
coordination with others right so I

00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,580
think this quote which is from a New

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,500
York New Yorker article about reddit

00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,960
explains it really well right so troll

00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,720
set this cunning trap if you ignore them

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,899
you risk seeking you risk seeming

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:38,590
complicit but by responding you amplify

00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:41,200
their message right and I come from the

00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,970
old days of Usenet and and all this

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,340
stuff where the advice was ignore the

00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,470
trolls right and one of the questions

00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:49,480
that we're wrestling with right now is

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:52,419
the extent to which we publicly speak

00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,620
out about specific acts of trolling in

00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:58,630
our community knowing that doing so may

00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:01,270
draw more attention to the trolls and

00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:05,200
run the risk of validating their efforts

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:06,820
on the other hand we're also hearing

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,680
from people who say that they really

00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:11,980
want us to speak out about this stuff

00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,160
because they want us to make it really

00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,440
clear what sort of behavior is and is

00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,820
not acceptable in our community so

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,670
that's something where we're kind of

00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,590
wrestling with another issue that we're

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:27,370
working with is how to deal with

00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:29,080
incidents of context collapse right so

00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,630
this is when people start sharing a

00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,280
story on social media without all the

00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,490
relevant details or context and

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,990
demanding that immediate action be taken

00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,339
because it seems like something that's

00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:44,069
like really bad

00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:45,930
sometimes it can be the result of a

00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:47,930
simple misunderstanding sometimes the

00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,400
result of intentional distortions or

00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:52,369
misrepresentations but either way these

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,009
these sort of things end up being

00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:58,920
leveraged by people who may be pushing

00:35:55,009 --> 00:36:01,259
one agenda or another and the way to

00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:06,119
deal with it is to provide the context

00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:08,160
right and then you know be patient try

00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,339
to understand what actually happened as

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,499
fully as possible before you know taking

00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:16,319
action based on something that people

00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:18,140
are outraged about online that's a

00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:20,400
really hard thing because sometimes

00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:23,220
sometimes it's legitimate sometimes it

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,769
is something that is as bad as it sounds

00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,970
and you do need to take action and

00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:29,039
sometimes it's something that's taken

00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,670
out of context or misunderstood and

00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:34,140
being able to tell the difference is

00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,869
becoming something that's increasingly

00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:40,200
important okay I've got a couple more

00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:41,309
minutes left other new challenges we

00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,960
need to address the fact that there's

00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:44,609
larger issues with harassment and

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,960
assault that have been lying below the

00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:49,079
surface of years and have gone

00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,420
unaddressed what we know is that people

00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:53,789
don't feel often don't feel safe

00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,369
discussing their concerns openly because

00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:58,289
of the fear of backlash that will result

00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:00,589
so we need to get people to feel safe

00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:03,180
talking about these issues otherwise

00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:04,769
people will think that the code of

00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,519
conduct doesn't mean anything if there

00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:10,529
if if if there are as somebody who is

00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:11,940
engaging in bad behavior and it's only

00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:14,279
being circulated through whisper

00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,720
networks and no reports are being made

00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:17,910
and there's no way for the folks who are

00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,880
responsible for enforcing the code of

00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:23,460
conduct to know about it then they won't

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,720
take action and people will think the

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,700
code of conduct doesn't mean anything

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,140
and won't take and it will be less

00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,299
likely to make reports in the future

00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,999
right so we need to improve our

00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:36,059
processes for handing for handling

00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:37,710
accusations of sexual harassment or

00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:41,670
assault in a manner that is respectful

00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:43,440
of the needs of the victims we need to

00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,029
keep better records of incidents that

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,160
have occurred in the past so that we can

00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:51,660
more quickly catch patterns of conduct

00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:54,140
that occur you know I think we also need

00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,609
to especially in the United States

00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,290
alcohol is very often a component many

00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:01,260
of the incidents that are reported to us

00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:03,510
so we need to have an honest discussion

00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,760
about the fact that while many of us

00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,590
spend time together socially we're also

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,500
a professional enduring community of

00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:12,470
purpose you know some of us are here

00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,119
because we're paid to be it's our job

00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:17,099
and I think we also need to develop

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,910
better relationships across projects to

00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:24,119
mitigate the impact of people who may

00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:25,800
engage in and do terrible things in one

00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,270
project and get kicked out of that

00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,270
project and then just go and do the same

00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:33,420
thing in another project I would love to

00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:35,790
see some sort of United Nations of open

00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:39,840
source that could address these kinds of

00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:41,609
cross project issues so got a minute

00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,640
left I want to leave you with some

00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:46,680
positive things that we can all do in

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,619
order for everyone to be successful in

00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,380
open source so streamline communication

00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,510
channels make it easier for newcomers to

00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,630
go to connect with other contributors so

00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:59,670
that there's fewer misunderstandings mix

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,640
asynchronous and real-time channels

00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:04,290
Skype hangout slack etc as appropriate

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,760
and understand and appreciate that

00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:10,589
English is not everyone's first language

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,780
second keep improving documentation

00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:14,010
create easy to find summaries of active

00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,570
initiatives in your project so

00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,430
contributors can get involved with

00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,349
issues that interest them and provide

00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:22,920
architectural overviews for future

00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:24,270
contributors three and there was some

00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,910
talk about this in the last session

00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:29,119
expanding membership mentorship programs

00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:31,830
so that they don't just focus on

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,260
newcomers providing more support and

00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,790
training to mentors and pairing mentors

00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,760
with high potential contributors for

00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:41,400
long term one-on-one mentorships provide

00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:46,020
non code mentoring opportunities such as

00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,820
event organizing promote its mentorship

00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,410
success stories in your community make

00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:56,040
it clear that this is something that's

00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:59,070
incredibly valuable also broadening

00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,480
creating a network of leaders within

00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:03,060
your community and with an open source

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,859
in general who have different

00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,730
backgrounds experiences and perspectives

00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:09,980
and focus on developing skills

00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:12,410
like creative problem-solving conflict

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:15,080
resolution effective advocacy and

00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:17,240
visioning the more that folk were able

00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,250
to broaden understanding of the projects

00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,430
community its assets and its challenges

00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:25,160
the better we'll be able to to build

00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:27,290
leadership within the community and so

00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,690
that when we do experience challenges

00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:33,460
there will be people there who have the

00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:36,680
tools to be able to mitigate them so

00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:39,100
let's get started and thank you very

00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,100
much

00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:58,570
jobs thank you very much are there any

00:40:47,500 --> 00:41:00,850
questions I would like to know how the

00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:03,190
community reacted when you introduced

00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:05,650
this working group because I assume it

00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,890
didn't just exist but at some point it

00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:12,070
was pitched and at an or I don't know

00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:14,620
how that work but yeah yeah so so the

00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,570
question was about you know how the

00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,240
community reacted when the working group

00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:19,930
was proposed right as X was that correct

00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,180
yeah

00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:26,950
so that was that occurred in Drupal

00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:30,820
about six years ago and I I had been

00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:33,190
involved a year earlier in helping to

00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,720
promote an event code of conduct for our

00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,270
events we already had a community code

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,010
of conduct but we didn't have a code of

00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:45,550
conduct for our events and that

00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:47,260
conversation back in 2012 was really

00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:49,870
really contentious because at that time

00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:52,720
a lot of people did not understand or

00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:54,460
appreciate the value of having a code of

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,660
conduct for event so it was very much a

00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,610
lot of folks in the community were

00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,260
mentioned we all know each other we all

00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:04,540
trust each other can't we just rely on

00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:06,520
that which wasn't sufficient coming out

00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:09,430
of that conversation in some other

00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:12,070
conversations it was really clear that

00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:13,960
we needed some additional structures and

00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:18,220
governance in Drupal because we were a

00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:20,230
and are a rapidly growing project and we

00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:24,190
were very quickly getting beyond that

00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:26,380
hey we all know each other place and so

00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:29,410
dreams the project lead got a bunch of

00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:32,970
people together over they had basically

00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:36,660
a weekend where they kind of worked out

00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:38,740
some of these ideas and basically

00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,000
proposed it as part of there was

00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,680
community working group there was

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,890
technical working group there were a lot

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,200
of sort of governance items that kind of

00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:50,320
all came together at once it was

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,620
something that a lot of people felt was

00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:56,410
really needed and so we didn't get a lot

00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,230
of pushback at that time now that was

00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:00,390
now at this point when

00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,130
thirteen five years ago we're at the

00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,830
point where we have actually outgrown

00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:07,380
that governance model and we're trying

00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:10,200
to figure out what the next governance

00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,119
model looks like you know and there may

00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,820
be changes they're very very will likely

00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,770
be changes to the way that we handle

00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:20,369
conflicts and code of conduct issues as

00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:23,730
a result of that and it is a challenge

00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:26,490
because we are really getting stuck on

00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:29,040
what the best way to achieve that is

00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:31,530
right that there's we're very much a

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,109
community that is all about sort of

00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:36,359
things bubble up from the community

00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:40,410
which is awesome and wonderful and great

00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:44,130
and but there's also a desire to have

00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:48,690
some kind of top-down you know

00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:50,700
governance as well and so and folks

00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:53,250
agree that that is necessary but what

00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:56,640
that exact balance is is a matter that

00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:59,630
is highly contentious so I think I

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:04,200
answered more than your question there

00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:07,590
okay thank you very much to us we have

00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,600
run out of time but your round here so

00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:12,210
the next talk will be out in six seven

00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:19,110
minutes thank you everyone

00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:19,110
