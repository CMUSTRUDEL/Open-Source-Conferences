Title: #FOSSBack 18: Diversity and Inclusion in Free & Open Source Software
Publication date: 2018-06-21
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Diversity & inclusion is very important especially for free & open source community, because:
- People in tech nowadays are hired to a big part because of their open source contributions. To improve the balance there, the free & open source software community is an important starting point.
- More diverse teams make for more innovation and serving users better than homogenous teams.
- Diverse open source projects are more welcoming and friendly towards new contributors, encouraging learning and collaboration.

We are building http://opensourcediversity.org to collect the projects and resources in this field. It is aimed at maintainers and contributors of open source projects who want to improve, as well as people from underrepresented groups who are interested in free & open source software but donâ€™t know where to start.

This talk is a showcase of the different initiatives for diversity & inclusion existing in open source, and a start for discussion where we can improve more.

	00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,080
yeah exactly we're gonna talk to you

00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,180
about inclusion and diversity and open

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,299
source projects and why we think it's

00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,520
necessary and it improves the the open

00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:19,029
source movement I'm young I'm designer

00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:22,320
at next cloud I'm Camilla I'm a software

00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:25,150
engineer at next cloud on desktop client

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,410
hi and I'm Charlie and I'm a UX designer

00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:33,910
and I work at the commedia Germany and

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:36,280
before I show you the numbers let's

00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,239
start with Ada Lovelace many of you

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,380
would probably say she's the first

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,060
computer programmer even before

00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:48,070
computers existed and in the early days

00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,579
doing software development was a was

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,860
like a typical woman's job so how come

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:57,820
that since the 80s

00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:03,100
the number of women has declined a lot

00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:04,600
in in the in yeah and tech especially

00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,749
compared to like other typically

00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,179
male-dominated fields like maybe

00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:13,840
medicine a law and tech it's still

00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:16,240
around 15 to 20 percent of women and if

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,209
we look at open source the number that

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,639
you just already saw is even lower it's

00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:24,340
between 1 and 11 percent depending on

00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:25,420
which studies you look at and maybe

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,560
you're thinking that's weird

00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:31,539
open source is open it's it should be

00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,060
more inclusive and it's easier to get

00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:36,700
into there's already community you don't

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,549
have to show a degree you just can you

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,349
can contribute to whatever level you

00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:46,899
have but clearly that's not the case and

00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:49,539
in last year github did a big open

00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:52,409
source survey to find out more about the

00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:55,899
contributors of their platform and of

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,270
all the respondents 95 percent were men

00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:00,310
and just three percent were women so

00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,859
this falls in the number of the one to

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:07,810
11 percent and it's not looking very

00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:11,170
good and maybe you're thinking ok so why

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,520
do we need to focus on improving the

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,940
number and open source projects and not

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,739
in general and put our focus there

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,720
because

00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:23,849
in the same study half of the

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:26,230
contributors that filled out the survey

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,360
said that their work and open source

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,790
helped them with a current role so that

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,650
means they managed it helped them gain

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,939
expertise and reputation that helped

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,310
them with a current position in tech

00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:39,400
right now so what we learn from this is

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,950
that if we improve the inclusion and

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,340
diversity and open source projects it'll

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:51,069
probably help and improve the diversity

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:54,489
and tech in general yeah and it's not

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:56,709
only open source code but it's very

00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:58,780
similar you know in the content as you

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,389
could say for example this is in

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,879
Wikipedia this is from the page on

00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:06,760
gender bias on Wikipedia on Wikipedia

00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,950
and yeah it shows very clearly that

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,870
Wikipedia editors are predominantly male

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,549
and as such

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,709
of course the articles and the

00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:16,989
representation of the knowledge will be

00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:19,720
primarily focused on things that men are

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,639
interested in and because Wikipedia is

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,919
this yeah the sum of human knowledge

00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,590
there's this shift or this this

00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:30,639
imbalance that is yeah not really how

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:32,859
things happen so yeah this is also

00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,349
summed up in the in the Wikipedia page

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:37,629
on racial bias on Wikipedia which exists

00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,370
just like gender bias where they say

00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:41,049
that the content suffers from the bias

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,909
of its editors which are mainly

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,829
technically inclined english-speaking

00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:46,479
white-collar man living in majority

00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:49,419
Christian developed countries in

00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,010
northern hemisphere so it's not only men

00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:53,650
women it's it's all these other

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:57,340
different factors which play into this

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,019
and yeah that's that's that's even only

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,199
the tip of the iceberg so to say because

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:04,599
this main group or this majority

00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,040
excludes like a whole bunch of other

00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,840
people like people with different gender

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,970
identities different sexual orientations

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,209
different skin color different abilities

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,159
different ages but also even different

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,039
skill level and technical affinities so

00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,709
at the very yeah at the very least what

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:22,659
is important to the open source and free

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,870
software movement is new people joining

00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:27,820
it so if we make it hard in these ways

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,090
that we don't even notice is hard to get

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,490
involved in

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,199
then yeah basically we will slowly all

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,980
get older and then at some point the

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,199
movement could die out so instead of

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,150
yeah doing that in these ways we don't

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,550
even notice we can just make the whole

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,310
movement grow bigger and also by that

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:50,479
can get new people involved with a very

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:53,780
diverse viewpoints and yeah if you also

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,120
take it to the just the commercial side

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,040
or the financial side and there's

00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,600
several studies by for example Harvard

00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,510
Business Review McKinsey Stanford

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,340
Business and and so on that diverse team

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,260
simply work better their their bottom

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,139
line that their literal financial bottom

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,360
line is better like only one woman in

00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:13,639
the Board of Directors or something like

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,000
that like increases the the financial

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,550
bottom line of a company and so that

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,650
alone should should tell you that it's

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,780
better to have a diverse team because of

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,639
course if you have a diverse team then

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,650
you also have can have a more diverse

00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:32,570
audience because you're producing for

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:35,780
BIA more different experiences and yeah

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:41,120
that's it's just a better you have a

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:42,889
bigger a bigger audience as that and

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,050
yeah how we can improve Camilla will

00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:52,760
tell us yeah so to start with let's look

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:55,820
at some numbers so the observe survey

00:05:52,760 --> 00:06:01,639
from 2017 from github points out that

00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:03,610
25% of women versus 15% of men are more

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,470
likely to encounter rudeness

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,979
name-calling and welcoming language or

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:12,620
content and so forth five percent of

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:15,590
people witness it and sixty percent of

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,599
people experience this name-calling 20

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:22,039
percent witnessed it and five percent

00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:24,770
experienced it so the problem here is

00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,550
with the communication how people are

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:33,919
interacting on issues on pull requests

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:37,340
and why is this important because 20% of

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,200
people who experience it they stop

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,320
contributing to the project they leave

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,980
so if you don't pay attention to the

00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,890
communication

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:50,440
in a project it's really damaging to the

00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:52,670
project itself but one good point about

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,010
communication is that everyone in the

00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,850
project can contribute to improve and

00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,670
fix it

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:02,150
and you can do that by having a code of

00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:04,100
conduct so for instance they weld up a

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,260
bunch of projects out there who provide

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:10,490
a template for a good code of conduct

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:12,770
like contributor covenant does that so

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,600
you can just change the template and add

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:19,370
this to your repo so besides having a

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,560
code of conduct it's really important

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:27,440
that everyone in the project is aware of

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:29,810
it communicate it's very important so

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,900
this is from a talk from una Kravitz you

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:37,010
know she gave this talk about getting

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,390
designers involved in open source and so

00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,890
this is something else that you can do

00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,470
in your project that is to have feedback

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,750
guidelines just some guidelines about

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,220
how you can improve your communication

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,160
it'd be nice to people in your project

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,270
so just highlight some points here so I

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,430
think it's really important to be

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,620
specific sometimes you are talk about

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,870
the problem someone else codes and this

00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,120
is very logic to you but not weather to

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:03,710
everyone involved in the discussion so

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,510
it is good to say why you're pointing

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,680
out what or saying what you are saying

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:12,830
in the discussion is also very important

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,890
to avoid exaggerations hyperboles this

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:22,610
can really be the motivating and maybe

00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:24,620
even insulate the discussion and so

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,230
besides code of conduct and have a good

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,530
feedback guideline on how people should

00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,599
communicate una kravitz are looking to

00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,880
some open source projects and she

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,010
noticed that other projects had good

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,440
documentation good website and good

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,919
guidelines had more female involve it

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,740
and so meaning in the open source survey

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,660
to also point out that people from

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,300
minority groups they really care about

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,550
documentation and good guidelines so a

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,410
good documentation Chris diversity and

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,250
diversity increases documentation

00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,810
because people who

00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,370
from the minority who is contributing to

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,320
your projects they are going to also

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:07,160
improve the documentation guidelines

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:11,010
code of conduct another way of improving

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,420
diversity is to make sure you label your

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,390
issues

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,420
now github has standardized that with a

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,610
good first issue so you can label it

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,670
making sure that it will starts in the

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,320
project know where to start with so

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,780
there are a few projects out there who

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,660
can help you with it like up for grabs

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,460
you can submit your projector so people

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,530
who's starting can look for your project

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,470
and the issues they can start to or con

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,780
and there is your first PR who is a

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,530
Twitter account that is a Twitter

00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,160
account where they are constantly

00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:49,080
putting up a date in the timeline with

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,930
started issues from github so they post

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,930
on their Twitter good first issues

00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:02,060
another interesting fact is about that

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,750
women are more likely to seek out help

00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:09,390
directly 25 29 percent versus 13 percent

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,940
of women they look for people they

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,070
already know well so I was actually

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,290
surprised to see these numbers because I

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,600
do that myself at the time to ask for

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:22,830
help and ask questions I always look for

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,320
people I already know so that was

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,630
another reason for us to have working in

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,640
open source diversity because we want to

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,290
create a safe place or everyone who is

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,020
starting can look for help to get

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,630
started in open source so these numbers

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:40,520
these facts they really show that this

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:46,380
is really important this is just a fact

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:49,910
thank you so two years ago in October we

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:53,880
thought about what we could do to help

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:55,470
people from underrepresented groups join

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,250
open source projects and open source

00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:01,320
projects diversify and so we came up

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,410
with doing a hackathon we called it

00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,420
opens first ladies back then and we

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,240
invited different open source projects

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,020
we had libre office next cloud media

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,910
wiki

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:17,820
and others come and join us and we had

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:22,080
participants and they were we had a

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:25,649
whole day where they got basically

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,980
personally mentored and and this worked

00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:30,779
out so well that they both groups asked

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,040
us if we could continue this in some way

00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:36,930
and so what we did afterwards is we

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,580
created a meet-up it's now called open

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,459
source diversity because open source

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:45,029
ladies was a bit restricting and that's

00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:49,410
not what we wanted and we meet up once a

00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:52,529
month in Berlin and anyone with the open

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,029
source project can come and get help on

00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,709
how to diversify it people who are just

00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,600
interested in joining or contributing to

00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:00,630
something have a space where they can

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,680
talk to someone directly and get

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:08,370
involved in a in like a in an in a low

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,510
barrier easy way yeah that's our goal

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,250
with that and we're not the only ones

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,050
with these initiatives in Bangalore

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,420
India there's a group called

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,160
diversifying open source and they do

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,579
something similar where they help

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,829
encourage open source projects

00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:26,190
timi Metaverse and help people join them

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:28,920
and there are mozilla does monthly calls

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,020
in about diversity and inclusion and

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,000
open source projects so you can just

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:36,360
join there and talk about codes of

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,520
conduct or how to make your event more

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:43,320
inclusive and there's other initiatives

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,390
that you probably know and two of them

00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,459
are rails girls Summer of Code in

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,959
outreach e they're both projects which

00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:51,810
are similar to a google Summer of Code

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,149
which help diversity in open source so

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:57,600
you should consider participating there

00:12:54,149 --> 00:13:00,360
as an organization or donating or yeah

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,500
just spreading the word mainly it's it's

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,360
very cool like with next load for

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,490
example we participate there often and

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,480
it's really super cool like the the

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:11,940
participants we get from that and

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,740
there's four conferences there's there's

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,920
two good resources one is called speak

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,560
adenine or org it's a platform for women

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,209
speakers where you can register and you

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,310
can if you organize the conference you

00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:25,110
can find women speakers and

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,600
four participants there's diversity

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:31,110
tickets where you as a conference can

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,700
submit your event and as a person from

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,680
an underrepresented group you can you

00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,960
can look through the events and see

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,670
where there's an event for example which

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,310
offers reduced tickets or tickets for

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:45,240
free or accommodation and travel support

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:48,900
yeah so should support your submitter

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,390
and that if you organize any events and

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,750
because we were collecting all these

00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,430
resources and yeah some are easier to

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,620
find some are more difficult to find we

00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:01,140
decided to make it a website it's called

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,240
open source diversity org and you can go

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,100
there and you see for example

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,380
contributor covenant up for grabs your

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,480
first PR and the other ones that we

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,610
mentioned are also on there and yeah

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,850
we're kind of making it as kind of a hub

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:17,970
for the open source diversity and

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,070
inclusion people to communicate and to

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,800
share their their knowledge and to just

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:26,400
like strengthen that movement basically

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:30,150
because for example also as a designer

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:34,050
because I'm also as a designer a person

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:36,810
who's not or where there's originally

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:41,240
not that many people in coming source

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:45,600
community I see that both and diversity

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:51,060
where-where-where the open source

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:53,040
community behind so in comparison to

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,780
proprietary project so those two are

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,670
really some important things that we

00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,410
have to invest in now if we don't want

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,710
to lag behind like five ten years from

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:04,940
now so yeah that's basically it thank

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,940
you and join our community

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,540
[Applause]

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,860
[Music]

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,920
yeah thank you very much are there any

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:26,510
questions from the audience just raise a

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:28,970
hand uh no thank you great topic and

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,050
great discussion I was wondering if you

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,960
could provide a little bit more

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:35,480
information about the success of the

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,330
renamed from open source ladies to open

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,910
source diversity I know a number of

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,280
smaller groups who are also thinking

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,620
about renaming theirs as well for the

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,320
same reasons as you but there is

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,440
concerns from their membership that it

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,240
will either dilute their message because

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,180
they're not focusing on a specific you

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,490
know disadvantaged group or

00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:02,480
disenfranchised group or it will

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:04,070
encourage infiltration from non

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,490
Desirables so I was just wondering what

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,560
your your background experience was um

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,690
we don't have any non desirable to be

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,170
diverse everyone should be able to

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:17,390
participate we just want to create a

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:23,360
like a welcoming space for people who

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:27,110
are you yeah I'm usually like we pointed

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:30,770
out in the github survey maybe encounter

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:35,390
more rudeness or this kind of behavior

00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:37,430
and we we often got like messages from

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,870
people who maybe felt that didn't belong

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,070
in this underrepresented group and asked

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,450
if they could join because they were

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,800
working on something I wanted to put

00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,560
support the initiative and of course

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,660
they can so we wanted to open up the

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:52,880
name because it was never just aimed at

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:54,500
one specific group but yeah just to

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,150
compliment so you just switch the name

00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,390
right it's very recent so I don't have

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:01,880
numbers yet and but yeah that's what

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,530
Charlie said so we just want to make

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,310
sure it's clear the message that is for

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:09,320
everyone not only women and the non

00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:13,250
desirable people I believe I guess you

00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:17,120
meant like people who are might be

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:20,170
sexist or I guess I say but yeah I mean

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,180
so far we didn't have anybody experience

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,900
so I so far didn't ever think any really

00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,630
bad experience

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:31,250
but we should keep eye on make sure the

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:33,860
community is healthy right um yeah I

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,320
don't know if he meant like what Kant

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,360
said before like the white male from the

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,860
Northern Hemisphere in a sense those are

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,650
also welcome what who's not welcome

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:45,890
obviously rude people that yeah that's

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:49,900
what kamila was trying to say yeah but I

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,900
guess that should go for every community

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,690
okay thank you again thank you

00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,970
