hi

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,760
so um let's get started we're going to

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,840
be talking in this session

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:17,039
about various various patterns that we

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,080
have found useful and a bit about the

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
patterns project

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,760
and then we're also going to talk about

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,359
some things that

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,599
aren't patterns yet but we'd like to

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,760
come find some patterns to solve them i

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,760
hope

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,519
and i've just captured a picture for

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,519
twitter let's get going

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
wait you should have announced it before

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,440
so um

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,840
daniel hello i think i think you've been

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,840
around the longest of this merry band

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,120
what is it what what is your single

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,440
favorite pattern if you had to pick one

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,600
um so a pattern by the way

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,239
just as an interaction right it's a set

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
of proven solutions to existing problems

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,159
and

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,439
then there is this community at the

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,119
inner source commons which is inner

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,680
source patterns

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,880
and my favorite one and there are there

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,560
are several of them

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,400
indeed i have the list now in front of

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,479
me i would say after

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
certain experiences with different

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,479
companies and so on

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,520
i would go for the trusted committer

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,439
because this

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,360
role is so so important like having

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,960
first people that they only have free

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,159
taxes and then others that they have

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,079
read and write access

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,000
that's that's important because then the

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,960
trusted committer is the one

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,920
helping to to have this inner source way

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,079
of working

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
in the right way proposing ways of

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,479
working

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,680
style guides uh mentoring people

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,360
newcomers uh helping them to you know

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
learn how to do properly called review

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,280
etc so trusted committer

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,000
that's my one excellent

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,240
thank you so much i usually take that

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
one

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,560
okay russ do you have a favorite pattern

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
yeah thanks denise and uh i'll do my

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,920
best uh pirate talk since i don't have

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,440
the pirate attire

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,319
uh so uh our uh denise me favorite

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,319
pattern

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,599
uh be the inner source portal pattern

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,000
uh all right so

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,239
uh the the inner source portal uh

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,400
pattern is about

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,400
discoverability uh i i love it

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,080
uh because uh what the inner source

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,040
portal pattern says

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,519
is to create a centralized listing of

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
all

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
uh inner source projects of the company

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,400
that people can opt into

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,239
oftentimes by checking in some metadata

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
into their code repository

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,200
uh indicating that that this repository

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,920
is open for inner source contributions

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,599
and then through an automated process

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,080
all the repositories that

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,080
check that in can be displayed in a nice

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,800
a nice ui

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,480
for discovery it's so important because

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
for inner source to have the impact that

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,519
we want it to have

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,800
we need to enable people that don't

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,280
already know each other

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,360
to find each other where they have some

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,680
shared concern around a shared project

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,599
and the inner source portal pattern has

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,680
worked at multiple companies

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,440
for that discovery and there's even

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
recently in the inner source commons

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,680
there's been a company that is

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,519
open sourced uh their implementation of

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,120
inner source portal which is also

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:35,280
very exciting so the inner source portal

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,280
pattern be me favorite pattern denise

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,640
good job all right

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,920
wolfgang you got a pattern in mind ah

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,000
russ your pattern is not a feeble one

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,000
but i have to spy with capitan

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,560
favorite pattern be the trusted

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,879
committer as well

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,319
simply because it well i don't know

00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,280
they're all important but i think this

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,080
one is

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,640
it's the central role i have to admit we

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,720
call it

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,959
at daimler we call it maintainer um

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,159
it's basically the same thing i know you

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,599
can talk about

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,280
what to call it but yeah i mean it

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,639
you know these people are responsible

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,639
for the repository they

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,840
reject or or uh accept

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,160
the contributions they have to talk to

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,040
people they have to you know be nice if

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,800
they reject

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,080
one you know welcome all contributions

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,840
right ross

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,390
and uh so yeah i'll follow with

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,520
capitan

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:44,080
[Laughter]

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,880
okay um and i'm gonna talk about one

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,000
myself

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,639
and i i'm gonna go a different way

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,720
um i think my favorite pattern and it's

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,759
because it's been so useful to me in my

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,120
career

00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,160
is what we call outside in marketing

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,320
so outside in marketing is the idea

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,440
that sometimes when you're a change

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,639
agent

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,960
it's hard enough just to explain this

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,720
desired state and get people to see the

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,479
vision you're talking about

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,759
almost always you are dodging

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,639
cannonballs

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,680
right i always tell the story about

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,840
being in sun

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,000
when open source was a new thing and

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,479
somebody tried to fire me every quarter

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,240
i managed to survive for six years but i

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,840
got really good at avoiding those

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,080
cannonballs right

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,600
one of the ways that i got around that

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,880
was essentially

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,080
by taking my career into my own hands

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,680
and getting the public to

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,759
show son how

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,000
what the way they were messaging the way

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,039
they were thinking about the future

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,080
was not what people wanted to hear

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,600
it wasn't satisfying the market so there

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,639
was a shift going on

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,479
in those years around trying to get

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,160
the the message that you gave first of

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,520
all not to be segmented

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,440
because the internet means that

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,800
everybody can see every message that

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,039
you're giving

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,039
and if they're not exactly in sync it's

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,880
kind of embarrassing but that was

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,560
that was new news to most of the

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,919
marketers that were working at sun at

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,680
that time

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,000
in the case of me i got very adept

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,520
at accurately stating whatever the

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,120
corporate policy was

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,280
and then i would take a step to the

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,240
right or left on the stage

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,160
and i would say but this is what i think

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,840
and what i thought was not always in

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,000
perfect agreement with whatever the

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,319
market plan was

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
and then i'd go back and circle back in

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,000
my talk

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,280
and re-emphasize that they have reasons

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,400
for their position

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,240
but it gave this it gave the internal

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,680
people an opportunity to see the

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
different reaction

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,160
that the massage message versus an

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,360
authentic message from a practitioner

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,639
how those two landed in people's ears

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,160
it's always better to have the public

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,840
or the audience tell the company

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,759
rather than you having to carry that

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,400
message as an individual because you are

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,720
a target

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,919
it's easy to target you it's much harder

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,120
to target

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,919
everybody else right but it does take a

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,759
certain kind

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,560
of risk appetite

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,360
to pull this off um and so i'm just

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,000
gonna say

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,560
it's it's one of those caveat patterns

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,599
uh that

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,720
that maybe isn't for everyone

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:34,639
yeah we should call you captain

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,639
cannonball dodging cooper

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,360
children in america play this game

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,000
called dodgeball

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,759
at least we used to did you play it russ

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,280
oh yeah dodgeball is great

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,400
yeah dodgeball's a real game they have

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,879
these nice rubber cannon balls

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,479
yeah the kids throw at each other well

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,520
the best dodge ball is played on

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,520
trampolines

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,960
and sometimes when you're a change agent

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,919
and as a company that's kind of what it

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,000
feels like you're you're

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,680
not only dodgeball but dodgeball on on

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,240
trampolines and uh

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,800
yeah i think what you say is is is true

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,840
but i've

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,360
i've found uh like you that the the

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,280
rewards are

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,440
are worth it in being a and being a

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,280
change agent it was a real inner

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,120
satisfaction i think it's one of the

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,800
things that draws me to

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,160
inner source is it's not only a

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,400
wonderful way to

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,360
get things done it's a wonderful way to

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,599
live as a person

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,440
like i'm living in my career at least

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,199
eight hours a day if not more and so are

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,240
all my peers it's a significant portion

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,240
of our life

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
and inner source is just a way to take

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
that portion of our life and

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,599
make it so much happier through uh

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,279
enabling and empowering

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,080
individual engineers you know through

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,680
being able to cross contribute it's

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
it's just a wonderful thing so it's

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
worth the cannonball dodging that it

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,959
that it may bring

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,760
i agree this is this authenticity once

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,959
you've had it

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,680
you can't go back and and open says that

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,519
too

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,959
uh once engineers have really worked in

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,440
open source they don't want to go back

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,800
to working in the in the salt mines

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,440
right right so right right and that's a

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,680
good thing

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,959
because you get better contribution out

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,480
of them

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:15,760
yeah so excellent all right

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,839
so now let's talk a bit more about

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,080
um challenges which was going to be our

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,880
second thing to talk about

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,880
so um tell me mateys

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,200
what's the hardest thing you've had to

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
deal with in in

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,440
trying to implement inner source uh

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,480
either at somebody's company

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,279
or at your own company and we'll go the

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,080
other way

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,080
well if you're first

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,519
well i'm trying to think what was the

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
hardest

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,800
because that i tell you there are many

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,160
shallows

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,839
and uh i said that in my talk many legal

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,760
shallows you know because i mean see on

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,680
the one side you know

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,120
legal people need to make sure that

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,839
everything is okay

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,800
and they have to that's their job but

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,920
they shouldn't

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,720
you know prevent innovation and now

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,360
engineers

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,279
want to drive forward innovation but

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
they can't do that at the

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,040
expense of the company you know to

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,760
threaten the company so it's always a

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,720
sort of

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,680
a struggle back and forth you know and

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,240
um

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,600
so i have learned a lot of things about

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,160
legal issues

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,120
that i wasn't aware of existed of tax

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,680
issues

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,720
right um you know transfer pricing and

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,480
taxes

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,000
and uh i think our legal and governance

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,200
people have learned a lot about

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,480
engineers you know because at the very

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,800
beginning of our

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,399
open source journey they they you know

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,240
this is kind of funny because the you

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,839
know the legal people said

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,560
you want to do what you want to give

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,519
away

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,360
software for free that we you know

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,560
created in our company

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,120
on our dime you want to give that away

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,160
for free

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,800
you you're not serious right and uh

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,959
then you know we they had nothing to do

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,360
with open source before you had no idea

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,760
right

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,920
right and so we explained it to them we

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,279
sat down and talked and explained to

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,760
them

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,600
you know and after what i said so you're

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,240
actually serious right you really want

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,240
to do this

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,360
and and so yes but then you know then

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,720
they understood the reasons why

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,000
so so i'll say this i guess

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,600
getting the you know the former

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,480
old world and old world thinking

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,120
getting that towards the new thinking

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,600
the open

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,440
and inner source way of thinking as that

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,320
i think was the hardest part to overcome

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,320
at first

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,399
you know and in inner source as well

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,720
because formally you know project teams

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,279
were

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,160
isolated we're doing and you cannot see

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,800
our code

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,240
right and we're not helping you to write

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,360
your code and you know that kind of

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,720
thinking

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,480
i think all details aside but that was

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,399
the hardest part to overcome to get the

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,200
mind check mind

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,519
the change in mindset going to start

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,600
that path

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,519
yeah that totally resonates with me

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,839
i'm and i'm betting with the rest of the

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,360
panel

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,279
that's thank you that's a really good

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,240
one okay

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,560
um let's see let's get daniel to speak

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,480
second

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,200
oh so then i go next so definitely

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,519
with with uh wolfgang like legal and

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,920
taxes that's that's kind of a really

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,560
new world a new pirate world that we

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,920
need to

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,399
deal with and do some hacking there and

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,959
it's about converting right the lawyers

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,399
and all the legal stuff and

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,480
they are blockers from blockers to

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,440
facilitators right so how how to move

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,959
them from uh

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,120
no no you are not doing this to

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,880
something like well you are

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,600
helping the organization to move forward

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,639
so how how can we work all together

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,000
um what i've seen is that once you

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,320
remove this

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,079
barrier from the discussion the budget

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,360
or the money or the taxes or so then

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,279
things are much much

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,959
simpler just one thing uh but but i

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,720
would go for for another challenge and

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,639
and this is this is basically based on

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,079
experience talking to people at the at

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,680
the inner source common right

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:32,959
and and this is about when companies

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,320
are ready to go to start an inner source

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,440
journey and

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,519
and these these needs of uh

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,480
alignment from the chief level right

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,240
from people

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,519
uh uh after making decisions and driving

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,079
the organization to

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,959
to the right path and then at the same

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,120
time

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,720
developers that they feel that they

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,880
should be working in a different way

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,120
with with other type of tools

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,040
processes and so on so the first time i

00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,839
heard about this and that was very very

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
true was by

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,600
denise and celina and some more people

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,320
from the from the community right

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,199
it's it's the so-called air cover on

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,199
ground cover

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,839
so we need both worlds she has to keep

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,480
advancing things right so we need

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,639
but then he said before right about the

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,320
outside marketing so it's about you need

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,920
certain support from the

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,839
from the upper management but then at

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,320
the same time you need

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,040
ambassadors that that help drive all of

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,440
this

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,040
um and i would like to to bring perhaps

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,120
kind of a new pattern which is

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,000
not not only outside marketing but

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,560
inside marketing with the goal of

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,639
giving the talk and the the states to

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,320
people the people within the corporation

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,519
saying hey we are doing this we are

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,760
working in this way

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,199
and this is our view of how we should be

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,720
working right

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,760
and that's another challenge which is

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,040
and then i will talk about the

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,160
challenges here

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,519
if you love me which is uh

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,120
being afraid of failing sometimes

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,880
failing is not something that can happen

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,399
in certain corporations

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,800
and that's something that we need all to

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,560
learn because if we are trying to foster

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,000
innovation for instance with inner

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,000
source

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,279
we need to allow people to fail at some

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,360
point because they

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,040
we we will learn probably faster if we

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,639
are all failing right at some point

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,800
so that's my thing

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,720
yeah it's hard and this is this is

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,519
something that's very hard to explain to

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,760
management

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,519
but it we have seen it at inner source

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,839
commons that if you're willing to

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,440
share your failures with the rest of the

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,000
inner source community

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,839
everybody benefits and you know i've

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,600
told you guys many times that one of my

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,880
dreams for inner source commons was that

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,560
it would trick

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,399
companies that weren't yet doing open

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,480
source into doing that

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,600
through the means of intersource because

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,160
except for

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,839
you know github gitlab and atlassian

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,920
it's nobody's secret sauce

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,120
it should be everybody's everybody's

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,560
common practice

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,680
right and um that one of the things that

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,320
we really believe in

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,240
is sharing both successes and failures

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,199
and that's why we have anti-patterns

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,800
in the pattern repository as well so

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,160
thank you very much for that daniel

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,600
now russ you got one uh yeah i have

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,320
several uh challenges and i i think it's

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,519
in the same

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,199
uh uh a thrust of what we heard from

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,680
wolf earlier uh but expanded a little

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,880
bit

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,519
i think within a corporation uh usually

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
there's

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,440
uh certain people that are responsible

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
for one aspect of that corporation

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,000
running well

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,000
and wolf you gave one of them which is

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,920
you know tax and and legal

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,079
and that person's job is to make sure

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,480
that the you know tax and legal

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,199
things work well you know so as they

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,519
pursue

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,959
their job they're wondering how does

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,040
inner source relate to this

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,199
and it's a model that's unfamiliar it

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,600
immediately raises questions

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,279
and it's it's something that's new that

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,800
you know hasn't necessarily proven out

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,839
on a large scale that they've been able

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,560
to see before

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,240
and i see that that same aspect happen

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,399
in other areas where people are

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,360
responsible for one singular part of the

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,839
company

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,720
and the the two that i'll i'll talk

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,039
about our

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,880
security and then uh you know our

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,039
functional business leaders

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,959
and when when you bring a concept like

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,600
inner source it talks about

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,079
you know broad collaboration people some

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,880
degree

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,600
kind of you know having some some agency

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
about

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,439
about where they spend their time and

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,520
where their code goes as a functional

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,039
business leader you know i'm rightfully

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,240
i might rightfully wonder how is that

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,480
going to affect my ability to deliver

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,400
what my technology org is committed to

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,200
the to the business

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
and that's a challenge i'm still working

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,919
on

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,799
on overcoming you know i'm aiming to

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,039
show

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,200
through data that we can prove you know

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,360
correlation and causation between inner

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,400
source behavior and then throughput

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,200
of business deliverables but uh thus far

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,840
the the growth that i've had has been uh

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,320
more in

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,039
kind of people that feel it in their gut

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,360
or there's

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,280
enough anecdotes or stories of how this

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,799
is helpful that people kind of get it

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,559
and make space for that

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,160
and that's taken the efforts that i'm at

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,440
you know a long way you know i work

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,440
you know literally with thousands of

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,240
people that are engaged in

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,360
in collaborative behavior at nike and

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,480
inner source

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,200
but to really kind of have it kind of

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,720
take over

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,240
and be the way that normal work happens

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,559
you know reaching that scale i think is

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,280
going to require a greater

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,000
ability to articulate uh and articulate

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,400
through data

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,080
and not just anecdote and testimonial

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,720
you know the of the benefits that we all

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,760
feel of

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,760
of inner source so there's that and then

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,880
uh security i think is interesting too

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,799
you know we've had

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,480
conversations it's like you know what

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,080
you want everyone at the company to be

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,600
able to see this the source code

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,160
you know what is that you know

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,160
you know secure by default it says okay

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,000
we should have principal least privilege

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,520
who really needs to see it and when i

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,240
come back and say well everyone needs to

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,960
see it

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,919
you know of course uh there's a you know

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,080
really

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,360
uh and uh when you think about someone

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,919
whose job it is to

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,520
to keep assets of the company secure i

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,080
think they're rightfully wondering

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,039
how inner source plays plays against

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,360
that so in

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,120
in both of those i think in addition to

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,160
tax it's it's interesting when you have

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,240
someone that's

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,360
responsible for a singular part of the

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,120
business

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,440
and then intersource comes in they're

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,160
wondering how inner sorts relates to it

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,160
and since inner source is so so

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,520
fundamental so transformative which is

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,840
why it's so powerful

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,720
it also means it touches up against all

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,799
of these people

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,720
in their particular area and those are

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,160
two uh where i think there's been a

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,520
challenge but also clear

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,919
uh clear ways ways forward

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,880
yeah so you guys picked really good ones

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,080
good challenges

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,120
um i will say that i mean i'm older than

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,919
all of you i've been

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,520
in this industry a long time now and

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,960
what i can see

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,039
is a decided trend

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,039
in the direction i think the whole

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,559
industry works in pendulums some of you

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,200
heard my pendulum theory

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,720
we go to extremes right centralized

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,000
decentralized as

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,440
a common one but there are others

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,120
and one of them is we place

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,120
the power in the hands of the makers

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,880
where we place the power in the hands of

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,280
the bean counters

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,720
and i'm i'm using that people who work

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,440
as lawyers and accountants

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,679
you know that sounds pejorative but i'm

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,760
just trying to come up with a way to say

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,120
not the people actually directly making

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,400
the stuff

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,360
that all of the back office and i think

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,760
to the extent

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,640
that we go in the industry to an extreme

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,520
in the direction

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,960
of of allowing administration to rule

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,080
how things are done

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,240
we kill off a lot of the joy of doing

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,159
the work

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,320
i had the privilege to work for both

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,679
apple and sun microsystems

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,360
both of those companies were more than

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,720
willing to innovate

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,400
more than willing to come up with

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,559
interesting new

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,760
and then figure out how to make it a

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,480
business

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,640
and i also worked for intel who had a

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,840
lot of resources a lot of smart people

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,559
and a lot of ways to look at innovation

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,679
but

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,679
nine times out of ten they would take an

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,080
innovative idea

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,919
to understand it they would explore it

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,080
but they would never actually go

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,080
into the business of doing that work

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,120
because they were so nervous about

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,559
triggering antitrust and if you look at

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,320
intel today

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,559
they spent a lot of time focusing on a

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,960
very narrow expertise which is they are

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,080
not they have now lost the plot

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,120
a big company like that right so

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,679
i think that companies do well to try to

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,280
allow

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,240
innovation and not stifle it and allow

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,120
original thought and in pushing forward

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
against

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,880
the desire for everything to all the

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,600
beans to be counted

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,760
um tim o'reilly said it to us 20 years

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,640
ago when open source was new he said

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,559
the secret to happiness is create more

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,799
value than you monetize

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,480
leave some stuff on the table give

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,640
people an opportunity

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,720
to go there especially the really

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,919
creative people in your company

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,080
and i mean that's that's what may

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,080
we're we're not cogs in a wheel

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,159
engineers are not cogs in a wheel

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,200
we're painters we're artists we're

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,120
pirates

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,120
we need to be able to squash and buckle

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,480
and that is frightening to some people

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,559
but what the triumph of open source

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,159
has companies that would not normally

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,080
look in this direction

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,760
trying to figure out how to walk that

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,880
plank if you will

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:51,120
between business as usual

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,159
and losing any hope of future

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,960
you know growth right

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,120
and i think that um more and more we've

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,520
seen the rising tide of inner source

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,880
it's clearly on people's minds and we

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,080
have an opportunity

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,000
to help some of us some of the poor

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,000
lovers that are working in these salt

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
mines to get on the boats with us

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:23,840
right so thank you guys i think that

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:23,840
we're just about out of time

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,320
