thank you thank you very much how are

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,880
you all

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,000
uh hope you are all safe sound at home

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,080
and i'm really glad and happy to be here

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,279
to give this this introduction to

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,359
two inner source so this is part of a

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,439
two hour session so i hope you you enjoy

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,279
this and well

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,560
hope you have some really great great

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,160
questions

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
so let's start from the very beginning

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,559
what is inner source

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
so the basic definition here is that

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,040
inner source is the use of open source

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,640
best practices uh for software

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,559
development within the confines of an

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,879
organization so it's about bringing

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,039
all of this way of working internally i

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,120
mean externally in open source in terms

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,120
of cultural approach processes

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,320
tools etc into the way software is

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,440
developed internally

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,600
at corporations and why is this

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,480
uh why is this necessary why is this

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
inner source

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,640
so important nowadays so the point is

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,559
that if we think about how large

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,119
corporations are working

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,280
nowadays this is this is what we see

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,960
those are silos and and basically what

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,840
happens is that we have silos of

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
development

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,240
styles of knowledge that are seen once

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,520
and again in different geographical

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,600
distributions right

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,200
so basically large corporations are

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
producing once and again the same

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,880
software

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,880
or pretty similar software um if we look

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,560
around and we see okay who else is

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
dealing with this issue basically open

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,799
source communities open source projects

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,479
have been producing really great quality

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,439
software for the last years

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,920
and so this is where large corporations

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,600
should learn from right

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,280
some benefits um so if we have more eyes

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,040
looking at the code basically we are

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,640
spreading the knowledge of what what

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
else others are doing

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
we can increase the code quality because

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,520
we are going through certain code review

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,280
processes

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,119
or we are having some continuous

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,399
integration or even continuous delivery

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,240
right

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,520
of course if there are more people

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,200
joining we are

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,840
scaling our our teams we are scaling our

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,119
uh development teams we are decreasing

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
our time to market

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,360
first because we are faster doing

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
development we have more hands and then

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,480
we have more eyes having a

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,800
having a look at it then it's all about

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,840
innovation so developers let's say are

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,319
empowered

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,000
to to try things to fail it's very

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
important to fail indeed to see

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,239
hey what's going on here i i would like

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,480
to try this new technology which is

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,680
uh really useful to solve this problem

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,400
and disorder right

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
and somehow we are in that way

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
decreasing the development and

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,000
maintenance cost because we are

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,680
doing things as automating stuff we are

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
automating processes right so we are

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,239
using the tools that we are used to

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,760
to manage in in open source and of

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,800
course if we have

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,080
uh developers solving problems if we

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
have developers

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
dealing with engineering and perhaps

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,200
even forgetting about bureaucracy and

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,800
paperwork

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,959
we have higher engagement right

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,720
that's from the organization point of

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,000
view employees benefits

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,040
um we won't have only people dealing

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
with technology

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,319
in a daily basis we don't have we don't

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,360
want to have people that are just

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
executing right

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,040
we want people to think about what they

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
are doing and in this way we are

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,080
increasing the

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,000
let's say that option of other skills

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,640
soft skills perhaps because

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,280
developers need to focus on teaching

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
others

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,440
developers need to spend certain time

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,200
building even internal communities and

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,680
so on so there are other skills right

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,879
that

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,920
we can uh we can improve ourselves as

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,599
engineers

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,000
we we will have more dynamic

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,920
environments again we go for the

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
for this idea of innovation as we are

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,360
letting others to innovate

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,120
we are just trying things right and we

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
are developers we we like to solve

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,400
problems so

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,480
we reach a point in time where we are

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,239
empowering ourselves to do things

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,760
right so we are allowing developers to

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,080
to make those decisions and

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,360
hey stop here inner source is not open

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,000
source and

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
yeah that's true but let's keep going in

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,920
the talk

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,519
so there are similar principles so we

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
are talking about a cultural change

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,200
right so we

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
we are moving from ways of developing

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,400
and producing knowledge

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,680
that we are hiding something and then i

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,239
have i have certain

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,720
certain power right into a model where

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,919
if we

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,600
share knowledge then we can increase our

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,120
merits in front of the rest of the

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,919
people so we are we are

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,040
we are walking that path and somehow and

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,199
for this we need

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
uh we need certain improvements right so

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
we need to

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,720
have open communication and if we have

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,479
this open communication that means a

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,240
certain level of transparency because

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,080
that communication

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,520
can be reached out by anyone in the

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,240
community um

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,919
if we have uh that transparency we'll

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,720
see that there is certain collaboration

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,800
right so

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,639
people have opinions and people as they

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,600
have opinions they will go to the main

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,600
list to the

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
uh any communication channel we have

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,080
internally will say hey

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,240
i have this idea here what if right if

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,560
we start fostering this collaboration

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
then we are what we are doing in the end

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,759
is creating communities and then at the

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
very end we have this concept of

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,280
meritocracy

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,880
this is not this is not my idea this is

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,080
probably something that sounds familiar

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,400
to you which is

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,960
based on the apache way and by the

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,960
apache silver foundation of course

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,800
and this is something that open source

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,720
is used to work in certain ways but

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,479
internal development or corporations

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,080
they are not that used to working this

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,320
way

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,720
so we have certain principles and then

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,199
we have our own path

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
and this is a really kind of quick piece

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,880
of advice right

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,720
so we may we may deal with tools we may

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,639
deal with processes we may deal with

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,560
people and culture in general

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,759
but the the general path or recommended

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,919
path is to start

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,960
first with people and culture just

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,680
because they are

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,120
uh they don't feel comfortable perhaps

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,360
because people don't feel

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,319
empowered to do certain things and then

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
once we

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
all think that we are behaving in a

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,360
certain

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,960
in a certain culture way then we can

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
start dealing with the process improving

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,600
the process

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,000
starting with code review processes how

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,400
to review each other you know

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,240
these things make us may bring certain

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,400
friction into development teams

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,360
and that's why it's so important to

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,680
first

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,360
think hey we are doing this all together

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
we are a team we need to move forward

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
right and then at the very end we have

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
the tools

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,120
so technology is probably the first

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,440
thing we think of but

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,039
probably is kind of the very last thing

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,160
that we need to think of when dealing

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,759
with inner source

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,440
and in general when working in open

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,400
source right open source is about people

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,680
it's not

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,280
it's about technology as we are

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,039
producing some piece of software right

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,479
but it's mainly about communities and

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,120
people like creating networks and so on

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,800
um so now let's go up to this point

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,319
let's imagine the following scenario so

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,800
let's imagine that we have all of the

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,800
developers in a corporation

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
and they all know how to produce how to

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,400
collaborate

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,560
internally in in this first case but in

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,400
a collaborative way using modern tools

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
code review continuous integration etc

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,960
etc and

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,720
they all feel comfortable so they are

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,360
working in a more open source way

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,360
how far are we now to effectively

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,240
contribute to open source so this is how

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,520
i see this

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
this is probably uh

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,360
we are really really close just a click

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,800
away to say and now we can produce open

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,639
source because if we think how open

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,360
source is produced nowadays

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
um at least internally in corporations

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
we need to go

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,160
third we need to go through uh certain

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,160
steps like security legal marketing et

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,319
cetera et cetera but what if we have

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,479
the source code the community the people

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,440
with the necessary skills ready to go

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,720
so we are this close if if we have inner

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,720
source right

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,120
um so inner source is not easy it's

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,680
mainly a cultural change as i mentioned

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,960
but we are not alone so please go to the

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,120
inner source commands

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,639
uh the goal here in the community and

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,160
this is an open community we are working

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,199
in an open source way

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,960
um we are producing pieces of knowledge

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,560
that you can you can reuse there is a

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,759
youtube channel we have some links at

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,840
the end

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,280
so we are we are establishing a body of

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,960
knowledge and we are educating

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,400
individuals commercial and non-profit

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,080
organizations

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,840
about the successful adoption of inner

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,639
sources best practices so this is the

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,879
mission of the

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,000
of the of the foundation let's say and

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,800
then there is one rule

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,759
only one rule and this means that and

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,520
this is why

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,440
the reason for this is that we try to

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,479
create safe environments so the

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,840
goal is we all meet there as a coming

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
from different companies but we don't

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,320
like bad prayers right so

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,560
chat from house rule is well i can use

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,560
that information but i cannot say

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,240
who said what so in that way we are

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,240
creating this safe environment where

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
we all feel comfortable sharing

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,440
information

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,160
some uh preferences there are some

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,320
documents that you can you can use there

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,279
are some books at the

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,440
innersourcecommons.org
