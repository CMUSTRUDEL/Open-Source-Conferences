Title: #FOSSBack: Wolfgang Gehring - The FOSS Manifesto at Daimler TSS
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 - InnerSource Track
Description: 
	Investing in Open Source Software means to go beyond simply using it – it means to become an active member of the Open Source community. But how do we get there as a whole IT company? We decided that if we are going to take Open Source seriously, this needs to become deeply ingrained in the company’s and its employees’ “DNA” and in the way in which we create software.

This is why and how we created the TSS FOSS Manifesto. The Manifesto is a set of guidelines which send our employees on their Open Source mission while having the company back them up. It is now a key pillar in how we become part of the Open Source movement, and we thus would like to share it with the rest of the world. In this talk, I want to present our Manifesto, the therein contained principles to drive forward the cultural change at Daimler TSS (and actually, perhaps all of Daimler), and their importance for modern IT companies.

	00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,160
thank you matey paul

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,200
ahoy and welcome ye developers and

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,400
sailors of

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,119
inner and open source

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,760
i sure hope you'll be fine and things

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,439
are just

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,480
jolly roger i kind of miss the times

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,960
when us pirates just had eye patches

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,160
meh so i would like to share a story

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,239
with you

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,520
a tale of adventure of treasure

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,440
and betrayal so

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,280
it goes like this here once upon a time

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,480
a fine crew of software developers

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,800
they be working for daimler tss which is

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,480
a

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,239
100 ships boat

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,719
you know an i.t subsidiary of daimler

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,800
who in turn is a builder of most

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,600
formidable vessels which

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,600
roam the waters of the world

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,000
well mostly land actually but

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,799
let's not need to pick here okay

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
so these developers they lived quite

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,400
happily

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,520
and were successful in their endeavors

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,799
to hide

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,159
and find again nuggets of

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,200
gold in their programs

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,439
for many years these developers had been

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,119
roaming the waters which were close to

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,000
their home port

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,159
successfully and their bounties were

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,079
handsome

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:46,159
but they grew more and more inquisitive

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:49,360
as is a pirate developer's duty

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,720
and they became more and more

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,799
anxious to go out and explore

00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,320
the seven seas of inner source

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,320
and open source

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,960
well okay the two seas

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,479
really but they're really really

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,039
vast seas so they kind of should count

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,080
as

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,080
seven okay

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:22,080
however there were many barriers

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,480
in their ways to these seas the seas can

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
be

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,280
treacherous and full of legal

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,120
shallows were they even

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,720
allowed to sail these waters

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,480
what are the rules of engagement

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,680
you know even pirates have walls and

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,720
a code of honor okay

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,840
and what would the pirates high command

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,200
and supreme

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,680
admiralty say to this

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,400
so they set out on their journey to

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,440
answer these questions

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
and um i'm going to cut a bit short here

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,239
because this is

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,480
actually kind of a long story in itself

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,280
so in the end the high command was

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,159
convinced

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,800
that it was the right thing to do and in

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,080
the best

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,440
interest of everyone to indeed

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,599
sail the seas of inner source and open

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,879
source

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,319
and they got together and sealed

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:30,239
the deal they wrote up on the

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:33,200
finest parchment a letter of mark

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,760
that would lay the foundation of all

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,760
inner

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,799
and open source explorations to come

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,760
they called it the foss

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,760
manifesto

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,720
a jester once called it the manifosto

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,840
it's actually not so bad i kind of like

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,280
it so

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,799
light shown upon this fine document

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,319
when it was signed and sealed

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,680
and i happen to have it here

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,920
with me and i would like to show it to

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,920
you

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,239
you see when you introduce new rules

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,239
the challenge is that you want everyone

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,880
to know about it

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,080
and so it is a good idea to take these

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,840
new rules

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,080
to the market square of your pirates

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,360
nest a

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,199
company and read them

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:39,360
out loud so

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:43,730
let's open it and

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,879
let's see

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,879
[Music]

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:57,040
so let's see um i'm going to deviate

00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,880
from the pirate team here for a moment

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04,479
our dimer tss foss manifesto

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,280
has three parts to it uh the first one

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,680
here

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,120
is a preamble in order to sort of

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,320
set the stage to give the manifesto

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,039
a solemn note and to show

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,479
that the high command you know the board

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,680
of management

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,479
uh and our internal foss

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,000
competence group hearing called uh the

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,479
house of foss

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,720
you know that's sort of like uh the foss

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,520
programs office if you will

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,840
uh that these are fully committed to the

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,039
foss

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,840
manifesto it

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,520
also states the goals the overall goals

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
of the manifesto for example that we

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
want to be

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,919
active members of the open source

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,919
community

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,680
so i'm going to not going to read it out

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,120
word by word to you because i guess you

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,080
can read it for yourself

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,800
so if um by the looks of it if this

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,600
looks a little bit similar to you

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,280
then uh perhaps you have seen and read

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,960
the treaty on the european union the

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,400
lisbon treaty on the european union

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,160
i mean who hasn't right um this is

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,160
a little bit similar just you know from

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,600
the big wording

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,639
but make no mistake the purpose of the

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,440
preamble is

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:24,400
not just to be pretty words um

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
a change a big change in it in a company

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,479
requires

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,639
well time for one right

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,880
and uh the bigger the company the more

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,400
time it requires

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,199
and for two a change is always most

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,400
successful

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,840
if it is supported by senior management

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,560
and by the crew if it if only the crew

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,960
wanted

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
then it may be difficult to get it

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,000
through

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,000
and if only senior management wanted

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,400
they may have the power to sort of push

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,319
it but if the people are not convinced

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,800
it probably won't be very successful

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,560
right okay so that's why the preamble

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,120
here is important and that's why it

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,599
shows

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,319
look this comes from the people at the

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,360
base

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,880
and by management is fully backed up by

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,400
management and they support it as well

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,800
all right preamble now

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,759
the next two parts are the company's

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,960
principles

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:27,280
and the employees principles so

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,919
here first the company principles

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,560
so a lot of times our employees are

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,440
still a bit

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,440
uncertain if they are allowed to have

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,199
their open source their own open source

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,120
projects

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,680
if they are allowed to contribute to

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,840
other open source projects

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,919
and if they can do inner source as well

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,240
with you know parts of the company that

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,680
are

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,599
somewhere completely different somewhere

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,759
else different department

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,199
because that hasn't always been the case

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,919
that you were allowed to do open source

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,599
event source

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,240
for the past so for various reasons

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,280
right so the intention of the company

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
principles here

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,879
is not only to show the employees that

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,080
they're indeed

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,800
allowed to do it but actually

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,919
sends them on a mission to do exactly

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
that

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,440
so uh let's take a closer look

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,319
the first principle encourages employees

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,599
to use

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:23,199
contribute to and create projects

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,960
both in inner and open source endeavors

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:30,000
now a lot of times

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,599
employees will tell you yeah that's all

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,039
fine and well but i have to work

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,120
productively in my customer project

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,159
i don't have the time to work on open

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,120
oriented source

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,560
on site right even though it may be

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,120
related to my work

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,920
so it is the purpose of principle number

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
two here

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,600
to let the employees know that it

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,839
actually is okay for them

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,560
to take the time to work on such

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,040
projects as well

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,240
now principle number three lets the

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,720
employees know

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
that they are supposed to learn and grow

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,800
with foss

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,080
take the time to do so you know attend

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,399
online courses or

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,760
real real courses when that is possible

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
again

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,200
for example attend conferences and um

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,320
even

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,560
give a talk perhaps right so

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,760
principle number four strives to promote

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,000
visibility

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,399
for example through active membership

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,200
and participation in

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,240
open source foundations so at daimler

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,120
tss

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,880
we are for example founding member of

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,959
the eclipse foundation europe

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,399
yay which you know i think is really

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,040
cool it's really cool that the eclipse

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
foundation has moved to europe for one

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,080
and it's really cool that we got the

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,640
opportunity to be

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,600
a part of it from the beginning as

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,680
founding members

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,800
awesome so we're also a member of the

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,399
linux foundation

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,360
and a couple more so and now

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,880
lastly principle number five is to state

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,600
that we shall support

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,040
our mothership daimler in its foss

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,680
endeavors as well

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,920
you know that is sort of our main

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,440
purpose why we exist right as diamond

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,120
tss as a

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,200
its subsidiary is to support tyler

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,480
so these are the company principles

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,920
let's go one further

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,959
look at the principles from an employee

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,160
point of view so they basically ask of

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,880
an employee to become

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,519
more active in the foss world and to

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,279
think

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,839
foss first so principle number one

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,000
says please look for alternatives in

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,160
inner and open source first

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,399
before you write code for which there

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,360
already is a nice solution out there

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,800
that is not necessary wasting time

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,480
reinventing the wheel right

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,200
number two says please be active in

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,720
inner source and number three likewise

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,839
please be active in

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,600
open source so that's the what i said

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,000
you know it sends them on a mission to

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,320
do

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,519
exactly that please you know you're all

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,600
you're allowed to

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
and so please go ahead and do it all

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,240
right

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,480
and number four lastly is sort of

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:24,079
a mini code of conduct please be nice

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,200
don't be evil as a certain company

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,160
put it years and years ago so

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,160
uh yeah we all we do have a you know

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,560
much more elaborate code of conduct that

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,920
is

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,839
more detailed uh but this here is just

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,079
very condensed be nice behave

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,399
responsibly okay

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:47,440
so to sum it up

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,240
we hope that our foss manifesto and its

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,000
principles

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,560
will help to facilitate the cultural

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,920
change in daimler tss

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,959
from a formerly we develop our own code

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,160
company

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,519
towards an open and inner source
