Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 - InnerSource Track
Description: 
	InnerSource is a fantastic way to collaborate and produce software. Join Russ Rutledge, Director of Community and InnerSource at Nike, as he explores how Nike’s culture of “Just Do It” impacts their approach to InnerSource. Russ will share their collaboration maturity model that gives a “glide path” towards InnerSource and the rules they use to introduce and incentivise new behaviours for broad adoption.
