Title: #FOSSBackstage: Russ Rutledge - Opt-in InnerSource at Scale
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 - InnerSource Track
Description: 
	InnerSource is a fantastic way to collaborate and produce software. Join Russ Rutledge, Director of Community and InnerSource at Nike, as he explores how Nike’s culture of “Just Do It” impacts their approach to InnerSource. Russ will share their collaboration maturity model that gives a “glide path” towards InnerSource and the rules they use to introduce and incentivise new behaviours for broad adoption.

	00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,640
hey everyone

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,720
really glad to be with you here today

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
i'm so glad for the introduction that uh

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,559
daniel gave to

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,200
inner source uh especially uh to his

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,759
emphasis

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,240
on starting with people and culture

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,920
first

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,840
so i'm going to talk about efforts that

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,039
we've had at nike and getting people to

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,480
opt in to intersource

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,519
behavior at scale across the company so

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,720
my role at nike is i am the director of

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,519
developer

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,079
of developer collaboration so our goal

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,320
is to

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
make it easy for ad hoc scaled

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,960
peer-to-peer

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,320
interaction and collaboration to happen

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
across the company

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,399
we think our agile org does a very good

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
job within a particular

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,399
business train within a particular

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,399
product at organizing development

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,760
but we have needs that span across

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,160
multiple release trains

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,000
multiple business units where the same

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,480
problems keep popping up over and over

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,239
again

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
and there's no dedicated team that's

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,559
going to solve those for everyone

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,239
so without some broad system for

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,680
developers collaborating together

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,680
people are going to be stuck solving the

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,920
same problems over and over again

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,760
within their organizational silos uh

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
there's one example of this

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,119
a lot of teams at the company use

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,520
kubernetes and containers

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,479
to manage their deployed solutions there

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,479
are certain uh

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,920
challenges and things that teams need to

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,200
figure out about running kubernetes

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,759
successfully

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,640
in one of the cloud providers that nike

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,000
uses

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,439
we don't want that to be figured out

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
over and over again but we'd like to

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,159
make it very easy for engineers to come

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,640
together

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,880
to share ideas best practices and

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,920
working code and solutions

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,880
all across the company so that's the the

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,799
goal of my

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,479
my team is to enable that for all types

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,479
of shared problems

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,520
problems that happen and we see inner

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,680
source as

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,640
one of the highest most skilled most

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,000
mature ways

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,840
that we can enable that kind of

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
knowledge sharing so what i'm gonna do

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
is talk about how we

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,200
evangelize those practices within the

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,759
culture that we have at nike

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,399
which is very much a culture of just do

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,560
it

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,600
so at nike this is more than a marketing

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
slogan that we

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,600
share with athletes and consumers inside

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,959
the company is also

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,360
permeates the way that software

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,440
development happens software teams are

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,920
largely free to choose their own tooling

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,200
to choose their own development

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
processes

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,120
which is both a blessing and then a

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,879
challenge in getting folks to

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,640
adopt intersource way of working at

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,040
scale on the one hand

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,080
teams are free to engage in inner source

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,640
software

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,080
to work together to collaborate but then

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,080
on the other hand there's no kind of

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,480
overarching guiding structure that we

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
can enforce from above to to make sure

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,319
it happens

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,480
so what we've had to do is we've had to

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,319
learn a lot about people and culture

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,400
just as much or more than inner source

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,959
in order to get this to be successful

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,959
so we've learned how to tap into the

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,879
inborn motivations that people

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,480
have already have and then to direct

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,720
those toward an inner source

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,000
way of working we've learned about

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,000
social change

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
about culture and group dynamics and how

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,680
they worked and learned how to position

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,760
inner source and the way we train people

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,239
on innosource to tap into those

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,400
natural motivators and natural lines of

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,480
up leveling that people already have

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,440
with this approach myself and the small

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,200
team that i work with

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,280
have been able to have a very big effect

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
at enabling collaboration inner sorts at

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
scale

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
even without organizational authority or

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,000
hierarchy

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,440
in order to do so so let me explain how

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,319
that works

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,760
what we found is that inner source is

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,480
just one behavior

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,080
on a broad continuum or a maturity model

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,760
of collaborative behavior

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,760
and what i'm going to share with you is

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,799
three dimensions of collaborative

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,720
behavior

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
on which we can plot inner source

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,560
there's more dimensions

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
than this but these are just the three

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,360
key ones

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,760
and all of these dimensions that i'll

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,200
explain to you refer to the way that a

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,920
person or a team

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,680
interacts or collaborates on some shared

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,200
solution with others that are not on

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,159
their same scrum team

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,280
not a part of their same agile agile org

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,000
something saying i think it'll become

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,120
clear as i

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,959
give some examples so one dimension or

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,959
aspect of how people collaborate

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
is what we call the artifact that people

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,680
collaborate on

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,200
and our idea with inner source is that

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
people are going to collaborate on code

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
they're going to collaborate

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,280
on working solutions i gave the example

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,280
of

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,199
a kubernetes before may there's some

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,240
shared way of managing

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,720
clusters of kubernetes or shared

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,479
shared containers in the cloud at nike

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,240
where we can bottle up solutions and

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,600
as code and contribute in an inner

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,759
source fashion that's what we want

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,960
people to do that's the ideal

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,600
another dimension of our aspect of

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,440
maturity

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
and how people collaborate together is

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
what we call the criticality of the

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
thing

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,280
they're collaborating on and our ideal

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
is that people are unblocked

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
in their mainline daily work through

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,400
inner source

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,160
when i have a problem that's on my

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,560
roadmap and there's some something i

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,960
need

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,000
some dependency that needs to be updated

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,320
that i as an engineer

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,320
at the company feel enabled to go and

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,160
contribute that to the solution to the

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,720
the project or product wherever that

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,960
made to be and that's the ideal

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,039
uh the last dimension it will cause

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,000
organizationally with whom do i feel

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,639
enabled to collaborate

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,680
this way and our ideal is that anyone at

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,560
the company

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
is my collaborative partner uh in in

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,520
some sort of

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,120
inner source solution so this is the

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,080
ideal this is where we want to achieve

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,120
this is where

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,840
we work to get to every day but we find

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,960
that that's

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,600
uh actually very difficult it requires

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,039
a lot of skill to have people take their

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,440
main line daily

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,560
coding and get it done with anyone else

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,880
across the company

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
there's a lot of shared culture a lot of

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,199
shared mindset that needs to happen to

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,960
get there

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
and it's difficult for people to jump

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,240
all the way in for them to jump

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
all the way to the right on this

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,080
maturity model and so

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,080
we've identified mostly through

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,240
observation behaviors that

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,720
are a little further to the left on the

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,479
model a little easier to engage in

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,720
require a little less skill a little

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,520
more entry level but nonetheless

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,800
our point of preparation for behaviors

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,479
that are further on the right you know

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,840
where we'd like to see kind of toward

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,520
full inner source

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,000
uh furthermore we see if we can get

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,680
people engaging further to the left

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
they'll start naturally up leveling

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,680
themselves along these three dimensions

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,080
until we get closer and closer to that

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,479
right most behavior that we want to see

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,840
so these dimensions this maturity model

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,720
isn't something that we made up it's

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,360
something that we've

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,600
observed that we saw happening and as

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,720
we've articulated it and begin to use it

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,880
and intentionally try

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,240
to up level people along these three

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,039
dimensions of maturity

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,039
uh it yields a very a very easy up

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,560
leveling it's very natural for people

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,160
and this is played out all around the

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,360
company and as i've shared this at

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,120
conferences like this one

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,479
it's rung true for others as well so we

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
believe it to be true and it's been very

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,080
useful for us

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,919
so let's let's go ahead and talk then

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,919
about some of these

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,400
preparatory points of maturity that

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,639
allow us to up level folks gradually

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,479
toward the right first of all on that

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,639
top dimension

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,319
which is the artifact that people

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,080
produce when they're collaborating

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,080
and we'd love for code and working

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,240
solutions to be collaborated everywhere

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,440
on everywhere but further to the left

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,440
one way people can start

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,120
is to just get them talking with people

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,599
that are on their team

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,120
sharing ideas is a powerful way to get

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,919
started and it makes sense it's very

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,440
difficult

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,960
to have the idea that i'm going to code

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,479
a solution with someone if i don't even

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,880
have a habit of talking

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,199
so one example the thing that we do here

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,840
is in addition to enabling inner source

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,880
my group the company enables a broad

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,960
robust

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,639
series of open community meetups

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,000
happening inside the company

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,160
every week there are now hundreds of

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,880
engineers that come together

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,919
to talk and to collaborate on all kinds

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,720
of shared uh

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,160
shared concerns share tech technologies

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,919
in the example i gave her earlier

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,000
there's a kubernetes group that meets

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,599
together just to share best practices

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
gotchas that they're finding there are

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,560
similar groups that do so around other

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,680
shared concerns like

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
accessibility or or observability we

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
find that

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,000
this is a common entry point that can

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,360
get a lot of people thinking in a

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,440
collaborative mindset

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,120
that get them thinking that it's okay

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,560
for me to work with and to get good

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
ideas from other folks and that gets

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,120
them ready for code collaboration

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,879
later on now as a as a midpoint

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,319
between talking with other people and

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,319
coding with them

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,840
we also find it useful to encourage

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,720
people to co-produce

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,680
pieces of writing or documentation this

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
can look like

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,400
if if contributing code to a project is

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,840
too much maybe somebody can

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,080
contribute an update to the user

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,919
documentation uh some of our talking

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,159
groups that it that i mentioned

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,240
with behavior further on the left

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,279
there's a an api standards group that

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,279
meets regularly

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,880
we're able to help them move from just

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,680
talking about api standards to

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,839
documenting

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,680
them together and documenting them in a

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,839
git repository and markdown

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,680
where they submit pull requests for

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,600
proposed updates to the standard and go

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,279
through a pull request process to

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,880
approve those there's another one of

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,120
those describing how we do

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
permissions in our aws accounts again

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,160
people submit pull requests to this

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,080
documentation from all over

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,600
it's not exactly working on code

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,959
together but you can see

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,839
through going through the pull request

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,360
workflow the shared co-creation workflow

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,040
again we're building that muscle and we

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
see a lot of people as they go from talk

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,680
and then docs

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,200
they naturally want to start coding

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,160
together i mean you get a bunch of

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
engineers together

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
writing about what they're going to do

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,240
talking about what we're going to do

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,760
it's almost inevitable people are going

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
to start coding together so we see

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,560
people

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,480
voluntarily like opt in to intersource

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,800
behavior if we can just get them started

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,320
along this dimension of maturity all

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,760
right so that's one

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,519
let's go to the next one and talk about

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,279
the criticality of

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,880
what people are collaborating on and

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,360
we'd like mainline daily work to get

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,800
done

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,240
uh but that can be tough it takes a lot

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,880
of skill how does that balance out with

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,440
my

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,160
sprints uh what does that mean for my uh

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,080
my uh

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,360
safe agile commitments or what my

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
product owner think

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,839
so just to get people started they can

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,480
start on some kind of side project

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,760
this could be things like a hackathon or

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
innovation time

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,279
we had one group at nike that built a

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,279
mobile app to give people an alert when

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,320
there's free catering available when a

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,880
meeting was over

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,560
for example just a project for fun but

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,160
again the collaborative muscle this idea

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,839
that i can work on code with people who

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,640
aren't on my team

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,560
builds that builds that mindset and

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,399
really leads people for this middle step

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,399
where's where where most folks get

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,240
started on shared coding projects

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,760
which is what i'll call a support

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,640
project okay

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,560
so a support project is something that

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,000
is critical to me getting my main line

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,399
daily work done

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,279
but it's not in and of itself my main

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,600
line work

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,480
let me give an example so at nike

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,040
probably like at your

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,959
your company there's there are many

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,440
teams that produce some kind of api

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,320
service okay for you know for some

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,680
business domain

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,839
and that api service needs to be

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,920
deployed out to the cloud so that

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,079
process of deployment that deployment

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,200
pipeline the quality checks uh setting

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,839
up observability

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,680
and moderate uh monitoring all of that

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,519
deployment process

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,200
can be a shared project that multiple

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,959
api services use

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,720
that deployment pipeline is what i'd

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,959
call a support project

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
it's critical to me getting my job done

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,480
around my api service

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,800
i have to have to deploy it right but it

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,640
is not in and of itself my api service

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,519
it's just something that supports that

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,079
and again around deployment pipelines we

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,640
have a rich ecosystem of people

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,160
contributing fixes updates enhancements

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,000
to shared deployment pipelines

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,320
they can be used by dozens or hundreds

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,440
of projects within the company

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,480
in the inner source commons there are a

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,040
lot of a lot of stories of

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,640
companies of folks getting a real start

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,600
to something valuable around inner

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,680
source

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
through these deployment pipelines or

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,200
devops projects

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,120
me is how i got my start in intersource

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,680
i was a team lead

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,360
doing a website deployment and we had a

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,959
shared deployment pipeline for nike's

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,160
websites it was used by a handful of

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,839
websites at first

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,440
and that ended up growing to the point

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,040
where uh dozens and then hundreds of

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,399
websites throughout the company ended up

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,040
ended up using it

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,920
so that's that support project

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,760
criticality

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,680
and again that builds the muscle where

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,200
people can then start working on their

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,800
main line daily work in a resource

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,560
fashion you know maybe if i was at api

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,920
service all of a sudden i realized

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,480
i can do more than just contribute to

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,079
someone else's deployment uh pipeline i

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,839
might take in pull requests for new

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,360
features in the api if i can't deliver

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,880
them my consumers can

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,519
can update that and then i'm doing inner

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,800
source on my main line project

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,880
organizationally that bottom dimension

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,000
the easiest thing to start with is with

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,320
sibling teams

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
within just some some small cross team

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,079
efforts usually within my same

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,800
organizational structure my same agile

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,360
my same structure my same release train

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,200
the daniel had talked previously about

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,320
the culture that's involved

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,680
with sibling teams they're closer to

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,519
being under one

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,880
one leader one way of working so the

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,639
culture is a little closer

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,320
there's probably some assumed norms that

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,240
make it easier to collaborate

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,480
uh an organizational leader can set

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,000
aside social space or time

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
in order for people to engage in inner

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,839
source that's a little easier

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,040
in the middle is engaging with other

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,959
business units

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,160
a little more difficult because there's

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,720
not necessarily

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,279
any shared culture or one single leader

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,440
that can

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,959
sanction or give space to this activity

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
and then kind of all the way across the

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,240
companies is the most

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,320
uh most difficult but also yields the

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,519
highest rewards and again for me this is

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,600
how my path

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,360
went with running that shared deployment

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,839
pipeline that i told you about

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,440
it started out with myself and then

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,000
three other teams that were all hosting

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,160
websites

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,360
in the nike.com domain we had one thing

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,320
that worked for the four of us and i

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,040
kind of thought it was going to end

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,480
there

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,320
but all of a sudden some of our other

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,839
consumer websites also wanted in other

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,519
parts of nike.com

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,760
so we expanded to that middle middle

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,360
level where you know all across

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,120
different business units in our area

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
they're using it and then eventually

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,360
this became used for our internal

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,279
websites our partner and b2b websites so

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
we reach that cross company phase

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,399
and for me and my project each of these

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,240
phases can across team the cross

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,079
business unit and then cross company

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,160
they all took about about six months or

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,160
so so each so there's some time

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,920
needed to up level but this maturity

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,399
model fit

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,199
maternity model fit and fit fit very

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,040
well

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,800
and this is the way even now where my

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,560
full-time job is teaching intersours

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,320
teaching collaboration among teams

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,480
we find this very useful and what we'll

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,560
do is when we're engaging with

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,399
a new person or a new team or new

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,560
organization and want to help

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,720
teach and move them toward inner source

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,920
through consultation and conversation

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,839
we'll take a little bit of a mental

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,680
inventory at where people are at

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,959
and maybe mentally put a check mark on

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,680
each of these dimensions

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,560
like this is about how this team or

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,839
person or org

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,120
tends to collaborate today and then

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,279
moving them toward inner source

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,800
involves taking into one of these and

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,639
then sliding it

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,560
sliding it to the right sliding it more

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,800
toward inner source

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,320
now the beauty of this model is that

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,320
each of these dimensions

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,519
can be up leveled on its own

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,440
independently of the

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,279
the others these aren't necessarily

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
coupled but we can take any one of these

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,040
sliders basically and try to try to up

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,959
level it toward the right

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,079
what it does is let people move toward

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,800
inner source in

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,760
little gradual baby steps rather than

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,000
having them have to

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,199
like jump all the way to the right i've

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,079
heard as i've been talking with people

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,639
in the industry

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,079
uh stories where an intersource advocate

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,839
might try to teach people

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,519
uh behavior all the way on the right we

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,560
need to collaborate on on all of our

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,320
mainline

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,399
coding projects with people all across

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,920
the company and it's difficult

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,680
folks that are talking to you may not

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
have the the skill or experience

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
necessary

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,360
and i've heard at times unfortunately

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
people kind of throw up their hands and

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,839
say

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,759
oh you know they just weren't ready for

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,199
it i guess it's just not going to work

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,800
that's a shame because they may not have

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,360
been ready to jump all the way to the

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,959
end

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,720
but but if you figure out where people

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,440
are at and invite them to

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,839
just take one step forward they can do

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,880
that

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
and then you can invite them to take

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,720
another step forward and often again

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,639
they'll get the idea and start uploading

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,120
themselves along these lines of maturity

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,199
so it works very very well

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
now when we invite people to take the

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,160
next step

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,279
this is a social change and a cultural

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,120
change

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,800
as much or really much more than a

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,240
process or technical change

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,920
and so we've learned a lot about group

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,320
dynamics and how culture change

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,040
works at scale they're summarized very

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
well in

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,000
in this book in this manual how behavior

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,079
spreads by dr damon sintola

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,120
this is an academic work and what dr

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,920
cintola

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,800
has done and gone in and proven and

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,079
demonstrated

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,560
very very academically how behavior

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,880
change

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,000
happens in large social structures

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,639
including an enterprise

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,720
or a corporation his basic thesis is

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,600
that there's two ways to describe

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,680
how things spread in a social network

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,639
and he likens it to the spread of

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,000
a virus or a contagion he calls it a

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,000
simple contagion versus

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,199
a complex contagion okay simple or

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,839
complex

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,360
let me explain a simple contagion i

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,720
think we can all understand because

00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
we're actually all living in the midst

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,519
of a

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
this giant simple contagion right now

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,439
which is the coronavirus

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,880
the the spread of a simple contagion is

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,000
that one person who is

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,079
infected with it can spread it to others

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,600
just by coming into contact with them

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,199
and unfortunately for all of us

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,039
uh you know this is how the coronavirus

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,000
spreads so depending on where you are in

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,199
the world you're probably stuck

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,039
at home uh i know i am and uh it's not

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,400
just a kind of a viral agent like the

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,880
one we're in right now that spreads this

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,959
way

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,559
uh dr cintola has shown that information

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,600
can spread this way in a company like

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,600
someone at the center

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,320
uh maybe a director as indicated in this

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,000
graph can communicate to their managers

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,520
the managers are connected with people

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,720
on the teams that are that are then

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,240
connected to each other

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,919
and then it spreads so there's some like

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,559
new initiative represented by this new

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,039
color

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,480
uh tell the managers the managers got it

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,320
tell the people on the teams

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,760
the teams have got it and you're done

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,400
now one

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,919
uh one kind of fallacy or pitfall around

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
inner source or culture change

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,200
is assuming that a change in behavior is

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,120
going to spread the same way

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,960
okay i've seen people try to do this

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,480
where the leader will say

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,919
okay there's this new initiative we're

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,520
going to change something about the way

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,440
we work

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,679
you know we're going to you know do tdd

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,320
or okrs or you know some kind of

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,760
behavior or process or culture change

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,600
and that's the way it's that's the way

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,760
it's gonna be and uh

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,679
it it does not spread this way this

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,880
change in behavior but what do people do

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,320
uh if you're like me you've probably

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,440
seen this several times and the thing

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,760
that people do

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,559
um again kind of when that new new

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
behavior

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,840
is evidenced by that new colors

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,160
communicated thing that people do is

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,200
they sit and watch and they see is it

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,039
actually going to happen

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,640
is anyone going to start doing it and

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,320
what they're doing is what dr

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,600
santola called is a complex contagion

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,720
model spread

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,720
in a complex contagion one point of

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,240
interaction with someone who's who is

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,559
infected with the new behavior

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,280
is not enough to cause the behavior to

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,760
spread

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,360
but each person needs multiple points of

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
reinforcement from those that they're

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,080
connected to

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,919
socially in order to feel like this new

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,679
behavior is something they want to adopt

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,200
so when that announcement comes out from

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,799
the um

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,840
you know from some central location hey

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,320
we're going to change the way we do

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,679
things

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,360
people stop and they look and they're

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,640
looking around them to see

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,080
is it actually going to happen and they

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,799
watch to see if people around them are

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
doing it

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,919
i hope that's something you've observed

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,640
i know i have many times they're

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,360
exhibiting

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,960
this complex contagion model of spread

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,240
they need multiple points of

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,000
reinforcement

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,600
so what we do at nike anytime we're

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,160
inviting someone to up level

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,679
along that collaboration maturity model

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,280
inviting a person inviting a team

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,960
inviting an org to up level

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,400
we intentionally set it up so that we

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,360
know they have multiple points of

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,280
reinforcement

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,440
that demonstrate that that new behavior

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
is a good one here's how we do it

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,480
when we're targeting a particular org

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,559
we'll identify

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,520
highly connected people that can act as

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,720
reinforcers for many many others

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,160
and they are the evangelists they get

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,559
invited to be the evangelist for that

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,600
new

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,039
that new behavior um uh these highly

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,840
connected people get invited to be the

00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,600
evangelists

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,159
and will pull together the evangelists

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,840
regularly in an evangelist council

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,640
this allows these evangelists to

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,760
reinforce each other in the new behavior

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
since there's nobody in their

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,799
organizations yet that can act as

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,120
reinforcers

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,320
so with us and the leader at the center

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,720
and the evangelists

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,760
embedded and spread throughout the teams

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
we can then

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,600
communicate the new desired behavior

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,960
that's moving more toward

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,120
toward intercept source on those

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,840
dimensions we can communicate that

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,360
uh to the to people in the organizations

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,400
and they have those multiple points of

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,799
reinforcement

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,880
so they can adopt the new behavior those

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,400
people can then act as reinforcers for

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
the next set of folks that adopt a new

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,440
behavior

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,480
and so on and the the behavior keeps on

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,600
on spreading

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,320
okay so this idea

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,320
of intentional reinforcement this

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,080
complex contagion model of spreading

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,679
we've encapsulated it in an easy to

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,600
understand and remember way

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,679
that we'll call the two two one uh rule

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,360
uh let me explain how this works uh when

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,280
we want to go into an organization

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,400
up level them toward inner source invite

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,640
them to take the next step

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,440
along that maturity model you know maybe

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
they need to start

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,120
attending the open meetups or maybe they

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,280
need to start opening up their

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,000
repositories whatever the next step is

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,039
we'll make sure to that everyone here is

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,039
two times

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,120
from their vertical management chain

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,880
that this new behavior is desirable

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,440
usually from their vice president and

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,280
then their senior director in all hands

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,600
we'll also intentionally set it up so

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,600
they hear two times from their peers

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,679
these are the evangelists that this new

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,559
behavior is good and desired we'll bring

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,799
in the evangelists

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,240
speak it in all hands or the evangelists

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,480
will get into the

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,360
newsletter or the mailing list for this

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,360
organization

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,720
so they're hearing two times vertically

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,919
two times horizontally

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,400
that this new behavior is good and

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,080
desired we'll also stack the deck

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,679
and make sure there's some prominent

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,240
project in the organization

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,880
that adopts the new behavior new

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,280
behavior

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,320
and is successful we had an example of

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,320
this where

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,679
in one organization where we presented

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,480
on on the value

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,520
of uh sharing and marketing projects

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,080
internally

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,240
we had one project that uh presented in

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,720
uh one of our user forums in meetups

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,559
that project was able to for several

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,600
months in a row get a new customer every

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,440
single month

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,960
uh internally within the company through

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,480
these presentations they eventually

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,480
doubled their average

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,080
rate of adoption for their tool that

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,919
they were sharing so that was our

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,559
shining example and we made sure that

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,720
everyone

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,720
knew about that shining example in

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,039
addition to receiving those social

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,600
points of reinforcement so that two two

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,600
one rule again two vertical leaders two

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,880
horizontal influencers and one

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
successful project

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,880
has worked consistently to change

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,159
behavior even though we don't have

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,919
organizational

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,240
authority we can have that influence

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,600
broadly throughout the company

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,120
now in ideating kind of what behaviors

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,200
make sense what things we should be

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,799
suggesting as daniel mentioned we found

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
it very useful to work within the inner

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,120
source commons

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,120
there's a lot of resources there for

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,799
ideas within the inner source commons

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,320
there's a series of video

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,919
and written training segments around

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,320
intersource called the learning path

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,200
you can find them at this short url

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,200
there's an open

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,880
slack channel that you can join this url

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,159
where you can bounce ideas off of other

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
inner source practitioners

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,760
we found that very useful in getting

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,400
ideas and then also there's documented

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,159
patterns

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,520
uh for such and such a challenge that

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,679
you may have at the company

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,520
here's a pattern that that multiple

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,320
people in that situation have done in

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,480
other companies

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,000
that have worked out successfully so all

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,159
these things uh give us

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,240
give us ideas uh when we're stuck trying

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,120
to uplevel a particular org along the

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,799
maturity model

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,480
and then we can roll it out with the

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,240
with the two two one plan

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,840
uh so with that thanks so much you can

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,799
find me on the intersource common slack

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:51,840
i'm happy to take

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:51,840
a personal email

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,159
