at large serve from                                new thinking perspective                                big data has a lot to do with open                                source technologies because we need free                                and stable and open environments for the                                Internet itself and big data means                                making available big amount of content                                for the users or the corporates are ever                                and I'm very happy and proud to be one                                of the organizers of golden passwords                                having this very very important across                                teams here at Berlin dealing with this                                big data and discussing new developments                                and discussing about what will be next                                year's password                                when you're thinking is from Bella and                                the crew is from Berlin the guys and                                girls from the communities who started                                three years ago with the Berlin basket                                and very small come together was about                                                                                                       invited to say hey come to Berlin and                                have a look                                now three years later we were in a                                situation that Berlin is kind of a                                start-up happens it's a it's a harbor                                for creatives in the technology field                                from all over the world I talked to                                people from I don't know from Romania                                from Australia from the US thinking                                about moving to Berlin because it's in                                such an inspiring and creative                                environment but to come and having an                                interesting job in technology and having                                a good life with a very huge variety of                                cultural and inspiring issues so I think                                there are two different subjects are                                coming together depending it as you have                                the creative atmosphere and quite                                central situation in Europe and you have                                this at this tech hub situation that                                many companies are moving here we see                                companies are coming we have nice                                co-working spaces a lot of                                infrastructure just to come as a single                                developer or as a group or as a company                                and come here or even just find here                                others to start a business so it's not                                only the starting point of Putin Berlin                                buzzwords is it would be the choice to                                come here because it's fitting very good                                together                                yeah well we have now about                                         than                                                                    a critical point for a conference that                                working together on a level that                                everybody nearly sees everybody at at a                                time getting getting getting harder so                                we have to discuss if it shall get                                bigger so we have them maybe a thousand                                or more people coming to the conference                                I would say yes and we should think                                about new topics on this big table with                                big data issue like for example                                visualization how this big data thing                                comes to the customer come through them                                to the businessman who are not so deep                                into numbers and in the technique from                                the technical side they weren't more a                                little bit I candy so this can be a                                development that how can how can be this                                data cute I just come back from from                                another event we are starting to in two                                days it's called the D my is a very big                                Design Festival so I think one way for                                the next year's could be how can we                                combine these design issues which are                                very big in Berlin too and this big data                                and content driven communities to have                                new products to have new visualizations                                there could be way and as an organizer                                of the Republic of which is a very big                                 social media conference I could also                                 imagine that there can be more content                                 driven tracks so thinking about what are                                 we doing with this infrastructure and                                 having best practices and not only from                                 the very technology technology driven                                 view as we have it at the moment more to                                 the the people who are dealing with with                                 the data in                                 in in their businesses so there are many                                 there's a big variety of opportunities                                 we have and I think we are strong enough                                 with this team and with this spirit we                                 have at Berlin battles that a lot of                                 people also will join so I think there                                 is a high potential for there is a high                                 potential for making it even better than                                 now                                 but we have maybe one one-third of the                                 participants in this year's I'm coming                                 more or less from the from the                                 university backgrounds are youngsters                                 just starting dealing with this                                 technology field we have to develop a                                 conference and it will say a develop                                 conference from the beginners to experts                                 to really the senior experts there are                                 talks which are already also marked in                                 our schedule so that everybody can find                                 the the right content for himself                                 everybody who is interested in open                                 source based scalability search and                                 store technology is a natural visitor of                                 burnin buzzwords because nowhere else in                                 Europe you can meet so many people from                                 so many different open-source projects                                 dealing with that and it's not already a                                 must but maybe it becomes a mass to be                                 involving bastards                                 cutting-edge so thinking about what the                                 next this is always a challenge for the                                 the team who is creating the program we                                 have always a call for participation so                                 everybody can join and submit a talk                                 this year we have a new format that this                                 the talks are quite short mainly short                                 about                                                              variety so don't hesitate to send some                                 some talk idea because we have not                                 enough time slots to present interesting                                 projects and it still will be a mixture                                 of talks from companies talks from from                                 the caller for participation and from                                 the creation team in thinking about what                                 are the very special important contents                                 we want to present to the to the                                 visitors                                 that's a question you should maybe also                                 ask all our partners this year we are                                 the first time sold out with our                                 sponsorship packages that's a good sign                                 for for us that we we hit on the right                                 place because a lot of companies this                                 year came to us and said okay we want to                                 be partner off of the land passport                                 because we can meet the people from the                                 open-source community there and it's not                                 only meeting the developers and meeting                                 the new technologies it's also been an                                 enabler as a partner for platform like                                 passwords where developers meet and new                                 developers new developments can can                                 start so you're not only come for for                                 hiring people and finding new stuff                                 you're also building with us the                                 platform for new developments in the                                 future between companies so this is                                 quite interesting for parties                                 from for me as a non developer it's a I                                 think the visitors are quite satisfied                                 with the with the contents they get I'm                                 looking forward to the feedback to the                                 beginner and the expert sessions how                                 that work out if it really fits the                                 interests of the people but I see when I                                 look at Twitter or when I talk to people                                 people are very happy to be in Berlin                                 meeting each other is kind of a reunion                                 meeting for for the projects so it's                                 what something what new thinking is                                 always trying to be an enabler to be in                                 a platform and yeah I think it works out                                 very good this year and we are complete                                 packed I think we have to find another                                 location axiom
