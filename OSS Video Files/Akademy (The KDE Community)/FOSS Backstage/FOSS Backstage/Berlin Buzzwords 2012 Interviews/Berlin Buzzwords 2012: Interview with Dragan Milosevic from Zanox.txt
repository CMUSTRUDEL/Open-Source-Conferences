	                              hi my name is dragon and I am working                               for an ox                               in San ox I'm responsible for big data                               and there I am senior Hadoop                               architecture                               big data for me is something that you                               cannot process on a single machine that                               means it's not necessary huge amount of                               data that you cannot store on a single                                machine but if you're not able to                                process that in a given time frame then                                it's a big data for me                                my speech was up                                what we are doing sonics with Hadoop and                                generally we are doing reporting stuff                                that we are using Hadoop to process the                                data and then we are using new sim cloud                                in order to deliver the process data to                                users in real time                                consumers are                                either publishers or advertisers and it                                means that those are the users that are                                in either generating the the sales leads                                Gleeks views and Sonics is responsible                                to provide aggregated information to                                them that they can exactly see how                                they're performing                                yeah yeah and that's a exactly one                                project and that illustrative I Hadoop                                is very important for us and in general                                we are struggling before we start to use                                Hadoop to provide some additional value                                to our customers such as grouping or                                related clicks with the sale and by                                using Hadoop way it was not a problem to                                process and billions of of clicks and to                                provide information that our customers                                can see and that was the click that was                                last click before sale but also in the                                same chain I had the following five or                                six clicks that were contributing and                                with that information they are able to                                optimize their campaigns not only to the                                last winning clicks but also to the                                clicks that are in the chain and that                                they're also contributing that were                                invisible without Hadoop                                well I know that in my company we be                                tried and really a lot of different                                stuff of it Hadoop and because you                                cannot do everything at the same time                                and we are trying right now for example                                to find small startups that are going to                                use Hadoop and machine learning for                                improving our product offers for example                                because offers are something that our                                customers are sending us and those                                offers are in multiple formats they are                                not structured or semi-structured best                                and you have to apply sophisticated                                machine learning techniques to                                consolidate those offers and we are in                                sanh oxen                                we did some experiments it mahout for                                example but we are realizing that it's a                                hard job to do and we are searching for                                startups actually it means we are we are                                right now in a process of finding a                                startup that is willing able to help us                                concerning an other                                no squirrel solutions and Sonics we have                                experience with HBase because HBase was                                was an in Hadoop ecosystem and because                                we have more than                                                   with Hadoop oh I remember that we tried                                HBase four years ago that was a time                                where HBase was simply a trial and not                                something that was very useful and right                                now we are quite successful using HBase                                with load error distribution                                additionally we have also an Cassandra                                because in the beginning we afraid that                                HBase is performant enough performant                                enough for us and we have also Cassandra                                small Cassandra cluster that means we                                really believe in noise coil                                technologies                                well I'm sure that we are                                third because the investing in in Hadoop                                and NoSQL on time and we started in                                     to to use Hadoop and we started                                productively to use Hadoop at the end of                                                                                                      that are coming to us we see exponential                                growth in the data in the amount of data                                but we see the tau infrastructure is                                scaling simply by putting more machines                                and currently we have no problem in                                handling up to half of a terabyte of                                 data daily that means I see a happy                                 future for channels                                 I think that Berlin buzzwords is a great                                 conference and first time then I thought                                 it was too late for me because I was I                                 had a planned holiday and I said to                                 myself next time I'm going to give a                                 talk on that conference and I see how                                 the conference is growing and how                                 conference is attracting a lot of                                 talented speakers and I think that next                                 year we are going definitely to have                                 more than a thousand participants you're                                 welcome
