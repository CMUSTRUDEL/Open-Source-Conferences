	                              so my name is Nicolas Pig Oberg I'm a                               software engineer with Facebook in New                               York right now I've spent the past                               two-and-a-half years working with                               Facebook on the HBase solutions HBase                               the no sequel database and I've been                               rolling it out for a very helping roll                               it out for various deployments within                               Facebook                                yeah so my presentation today was on                                multi-tenancy and multi-tenant                                applications within Facebook so with                                HBase so it was really going from this                                problem of you have this no sequel                                solution that's great you've launched it                                to one product that's amazing everybody                                has done that so how do you expand from                                there how do you keep on adding new                                applications how do you know when you're                                going to fast or how do you know when                                you're going to slow and how can you                                make this work how can you take a system                                that's like no sequel that's at the edge                                and how can you make it something that's                                pervasive and part of culture like my                                sequel                                I think when you start talking about Big                                Data we're living in an Internet world                                where everybody can be connected and                                where the the information that people                                have is greater than a single machine                                and so to be able to analyze it you need                                tools that can operate on multiple                                machines and that can operate                                efficiently we're getting to an age                                where np-complete doesn't matter anymore                                a linear algorithm can't scale at a                                certain level and that's what Big Data                                means me                                I think a lot of great technologies                                around HBase with the no sequels type                                solutions around eventual consistency                                around cross data center basically                                various ways of modeling around graph                                databases I'm interested at the                                different ways that we can visualize                                Facebook is done a great job of                                visualizing connections between friends                                in between places and I think those sort                                of relationships and expounding upon                                those sort of relationships in the                                future will end up influencing Big Data                                I think there's a mixture of we're                                really wanting to make products that                                impact users and so instead of trying to                                develop big data platforms for a                                theoretical product we're trying to                                utilize the existing technologies to                                create something that users enjoy and                                users like and users find value of and                                after we see that they have found value                                we want to go back and see how we can                                make a Big Data solution that optimizes                                that and that handles that in a more                                productive way for the user                                there's definitely multiple approaches                                that you could take there I think other                                major companies like Yelp have shown                                about sort of taste graph and different                                ways of viewing sort of the                                relationships of people I think Facebook                                has done a great job of seeing that                                people want to be more open and                                connected and people want to converse                                with each other I think there's also                                various other ways of viewing the                                connections that we have with our                                outside world and I think that's                                definitely an emerging market of what                                sort of connections do people have and                                how can we model those connections and                                present it back to the user in a way                                that's valuable for them not just in a                                way that is an interesting picture                                I think there's lots of great                                opportunities in the big data space                                there's been a lot of great startups                                like in Silicon Valley and in New York                                that have been focused on solving the                                big data problem for the average                                developer and I think we're going to get                                the next wave of visualizations and if                                you can be on top of what a very useful                                visualization is recognizing when it                                comes you know you look at a company                                like Facebook and I think one of the                                greatest things that we've done is that                                we haven't just built a product but                                we've had other companies that have been                                 able to build on top of us and make                                 great success stories and there's still                                 situations like that with Facebook and                                 there'll be other companies that will                                 come along that people will be able to                                 utilize their view of the world to                                 enhance users experience                                 your your guess is as good as mine I                                 think the important part for me as a                                 software engineer is really focusing on                                 how can I make this scale how can I make                                 the next generation I think you need a                                 good balance between being able to                                 visualize the future and being able to                                 see if you can pragmatically actually                                 make the future work like I said you                                 when you were getting in this big data                                 solution where a linear algorithm                                 doesn't matter anymore                                 like how do you get sublinear how do you                                 think sublinear how do you program for                                 that how do you make the infrastructure                                 around that I think these are all good                                 questions to be asking                                 ha                                 Facebook is hiring all the great                                 developers that we can we're definitely                                 hiring now in New York and in San                                 Francisco I think the best thing is to                                 really be solid on your fundamental                                 solid on understanding those different                                 data structures that are in the world                                 and how they all intermix together I                                 tend to have conversations with people                                 that when they they can recognize the                                 patterns in the world and the patterns                                 that occur in computing and in everyday                                 life I think that's just part of                                 Facebook is is realizing that it is a                                 social graph in addition to being social                                 connections and real really being able                                 to look at life and friendships in the                                 patterns that actually matter for                                 computers                                 this is a great conference there's a                                 wide variety of talks here I noticed                                 there's a very sort of unique scene here                                 every place I've gone has had different                                 focuses and different like centers of                                 specialization and Berlin here has a                                 great tech community and has a lot of                                 support behind here and they have a lot                                 of novel solutions around here that are                                 not able to be found in other areas I                                 think it's good to take advantage of the                                 great tech centers that you have in the                                 various parts of our world
