	                              my name is Leslie Hawthorne and I'm                               currently on the Community Action and                               impact segment of the open source and                               standards team in Red Hat                               I work in the community management space                               and I've been involved in the open                               source community for about six years now                               as a community manager and I've been a                               happy user of Foss for about ten years                                so my topic was cultivating community                                how to make your project blossom and we                                talked a bit about what community is                                what community isn't how to look at your                                community through the lens of a                                community as a garden so a group of                                disparate plants or disparate people who                                come together to make a beautiful whole                                that is self supporting and self                                sustaining so and then also best                                practices sort of through the lens of                                community as garden so things like                                making sure that you well define your                                landscape to make sure that it's clear                                to people how you've structured your                                project what your goals are what you're                                trying to achieve and what they can                                expect if they come into your community                                and would like to contribute and then I                                think that my other favorite point for                                my talk is talking about the importance                                of plucking out your weeds in your                                garden making sure that you keep your                                community healthy and happy by                                encouraging folks who may not be well                                aligned with your mission and goals to                                seek seek their quest elsewhere                                so my opinion on big data is probably                                not as lost as a lot of the other folks                                here since I'm not an engineer but                                generally speaking I think it's we're                                living in very exciting times now right                                there is so much more data being                                generated by folks and being able to use                                that data to make the world a better                                place I think is being incredibly                                compelling you know what Twitter is                                getting like                                                         we're able to model things like spread                                of disease we're able to model things                                like climate change we're able to model                                all kinds of information which before                                was largely you know done by researchers                                with very small sets of data and now                                we're able to get much more conclusive                                proofs of you know changes that are                                happening in our wider world and then                                using that information to make better                                decisions for policy and for you know                                all of our users and developers our                                projects as well                                so readout is involved in the big day                                because                                to go through their sponsorship of the                                Gluster project cluster is but the                                community and a product and cluster was                                acquired by red hot late last year and                                so now the Gluster                                codebase is presented to the world as                                where I had enterprise storage so we                                find that users are really excited about                                lustre for being able to sort of tame                                their unstructured Big Data                                um there are ones that I am particularly                                excited about in specific but I know                                that there are a lot of folks who are                                doing some really compelling work here I                                have to give a shout out to the Cloudera                                folks just because I know some of their                                founders but yeah I'm not I'm not                                necessarily the world's biggest expert                                on big data                                there's a lot of things this is an                                incredibly vibrant community ever I've                                had more interesting talks in the                                hallway track than I've had at                                conferences two or three times the size                                everyone is very welcoming everyone is                                really passionate about what they're                                working on you know you can overhear                                various conversations going on to people                                like really getting down into it like                                switching laptops back and forth the                                same no no it's like this no no it's                                like this so this is a really great                                place to come if you really actually                                want to learn something and be very                                hands-on in your particular topic area                                and Berlin is a great city this is my                                first time here this actually my first                                 time in Germany so a really beautiful                                 place to be and folks are just super                                 passionate here which is great so often                                 I go to larger conferences and it's much                                 more focused on kind of the de rigueur                                 of business which is very important but                                 this is much more physical more                                 community-oriented much more grassroots                                 very very opening and welcoming                                 I think that we're just gonna keep                                 seeing more and more compelling use                                 cases for understanding human behavior                                 and also like scientific data biological                                 data etc my own personal passion as I                                 said was talking about like you know hey                                 community is a garden right so as you                                 can imagine I really and excited about                                 stuff has to do with plants and there is                                 an unbelievable amount of data on                                 Biological data on plants and on botany                                 in general that right now is is just                                 kind of sitting on computers under                                 people's desks at universities and isn't                                 being very widely used so what I'm                                 hoping that we'll see what the Big Data                                 movement is all that data is going to be                                 collected it's gonna be aggregated it's                                 giving much more widely useful for the                                 world                                 well let's see a beautiful city you get                                 treated really well and you get to talk                                 to a bunch of really cool people who are                                 really excited about what you're talking                                 about and who come up and ask you great                                 questions and really want to learn from                                 you so you should totally be here
