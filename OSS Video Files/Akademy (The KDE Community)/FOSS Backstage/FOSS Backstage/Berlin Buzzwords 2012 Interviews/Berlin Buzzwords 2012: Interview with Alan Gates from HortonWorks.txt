	                              so I'm Alan gates I'm one of the                               founders of Hortonworks which is a                               startup that works on Hadoop we do a lot                               of the development behind to do and                               related projects such as pig and some of                               the others and I've been involved in                               Hadoop related projects for about five                               years now I started with pig five years                               ago and then the last couple years I've                                been working on H catalog                                so I think there's multiple dimensions                                of bigness in big data right obviously                                one of them is just large size right                                collecting everything what they call                                web-scale now everybody you know that's                                pretty obvious everyone sees that one                                pretty quickly I think the other things                                the other bigness things about big data                                is the complexity of the data that                                people are capturing data now that's                                much richer than they used to or maybe                                it would be more fair to say there with                                a big data tools available now it's                                easier to maintain that richness right                                you don't end up having to flatten the                                data out and keep it in some relational                                relational schema you can retain the                                structure of the data as it comes in and                                then finally I think there's a big nests                                in the in the complexity of the                                processing with these new tools people                                are processing data in ways that would                                have been hard with the last generation                                of data tools right there's ability to                                do data model building and graph                                traversal type operations and other new                                algorithms that were just a lot harder                                with a previous set of tools so I think                                all those dimensions add up to the                                bigness of Big Data                                so I mean big data is emerging in a                                number of different ways right I mean we                                see it in the new city sorry no sequel                                data stores that are focused on a lot                                more on scale and on not having all the                                heavyweight nosotras we see it in big                                systems like Hadoop that are doing batch                                data processing over very vast scales                                and we see a lot of innovation and those                                both those fields are changing and                                growing very quickly I mean there's I                                read about a new no sequel store it                                seems like you know every few months                                there's a new one comes out painted some                                new use case Hadoop itself is growing a                                lot expanding beyond its origins in the                                MapReduce world to more different types                                of processing of data so I think there's                                a lot of innovation going on there for                                whatever your use case is                                sure so I mean obviously there's my                                startup important works we do we do                                Hadoop stuff there's you know other                                startups that are doing you know big                                data stuff Tenjin comes to mind with                                their they do a lot of work on MongoDB                                great what else that that's the only one                                that comes to mind up top my head back                                it's a great conference                                really enjoyed my time so far I mean                                Berlin's a wonderful city it's I've                                enjoyed coming here and then the talks                                have been high-quality so far and I've                                been enjoying                                I did i I've met people I knew from                                online right so being part of a new for                                a long time I've been part of the Apache                                foundation for a while now so there's                                lots of European members of the Apache                                that I've certainly seen any you know                                met an email and but I've never met face                                to face so that's been great
