	                              so thank you for having me here it's                               really nice to see all these people                               coming also in Berlin I'm Cassie come                               i'm from fish market in the netherlands                               last week we had our flesh Mackers                               festival in Amsterdam which was really                               wonderful and I hope that you will have                               the same experience here as well                               unfortunately I have to say that ad                                until May or is not here today because                                he is expecting his third child this                                week so that was a good excuse to stay                                home I will tell you something today                                about the five years of fresh makers in                                which we built a platform for innovator                                from large companies state-of-the-art                                bureaus knowledge institutions and                                government and I share some lessons                                learned and tell you a bit of how we did                                that well the five years ago fleas                                markers were started by adding tilma                                your and Susanna camps in                                              started well from from the motivation                                that they saw in in large companies the                                need for gaining more knowledge about                                Nov innovation and especially seeing in                                these large companies the people who                                were working on innovation the real                                innovators with an entrepreneurial                                spirit also called intrapreneurs and                                well this is the people that have                                high-risk projects work on really big                                things get things done that other people                                often can't but they also have low                                budgets and for these people we want to                                we wanted to start this platform to be                                able to share knowledge meet peers and                                share their projects and experiences and                                what that's well that's how it began we                                started with organizing networking                                events for innovation managers                                and what we specifically chose was a                                personal approach this is really one of                                our strengths all the innovation                                managers are members in our network and                                many others we know them personally we                                speak to them quite a lot so we really                                know what's what's going on and one of                                the other usps is that we use powerful                                tool tools and formats such as the                                presentation in                                                      forces you as a speaker to really                                densely tell your story and really get                                to the core so people in the audience                                get to know your quickly get to know                                your challenges and and it's often                                really quickly about the content and not                                so much about the small talk which is I                                think really valuable for everyone and                                in                                                                  also incorporated communication                                marketing managers human research                                managers NIT managers because we also                                saw the need for for innovation and                                change in that in that area and what                                were our results well we organized a                                strong community we have a strong brand                                we organized a lot of successful events                                and we are really open and transparent                                so we share what we do with others at                                the moment we estimated around ten                                percent of our target group knows about                                risk markers or has been active in a                                network or still is exit in the network                                we have a database of over                                       followers and attract more than                                    unique visitors to our website every day                                and the base of of the community is a                                strong amount of                                                        from which five to six hundred people                                are active in in the network on the                                yearly basis and we talked to them a lot                                so we really know what's going on and                                that's why we became a sparing partner                                for a lot of organizations and companies                                as well and of course we also drew                                intern                                like you're sitting here we worked with                                new thinking on fresh macaroni which                                well is it's really great and and this                                is well with the results how do we go on                                of course we want to grow and expand the                                network further we are at the moment                                experimenting with new membership models                                because our old membership model was                                members pay a fixed fee a year and and                                if you want to go to an event you have                                to pay but well we we realized we didn't                                get our full potential with that so now                                 we introduce the freemium model and we                                 already get really good at them really                                 good results with that so we really hope                                 to grow the network both in the                                 Netherlands and here and what we would                                 really like to do is also go to other                                 countries to start a fish market network                                 so if you know anyone in other Western                                 European countries who would like to                                 build up something like this you're most                                 welcome thank you very much
