	                              Thank You charlie and we're welcome                               thank you everybody for joining                               joining this talk last work at as a                               software engineer at way comp in the                               Netherlands and last year we did a                               project around the field searches and I                               thought it would be nice to share the                               results we got so what's the way camp                               they compass a Dutch online e-commerce                                store we have a lot of customers a lot                                of visitors we ship a lot of packages                                per year then we also have a lot of                                different products and a lot of                                different brands so as any e-commerce                                store we have a website where you can                                search for items in the search bar but                                sometimes you end up with no results and                                the this was how last year was our                                search results failed search results                                page and this is what we call a field                                search when there are no search results                                and if you can see it's quite boring                                it's empty and unfortunately a lot of                                customers also ended their journey here                                so we wanted to improve upon that so how                                did we approach it                                well first we sat down and looked okay                                what could be the reason that customers                                end up on this on this page so for                                instance could be that we don't have the                                product or the brand and could be that                                we have the product but we cannot find                                it or the product is sold out or it's                                not released yet like the newest iPhone                                people are already searching for it but                                nobody has it in stock yet we saw that                                the most reason most common reason was                                that we don't have the product or the                                brand and after that we have the product                                but you cannot find it so this was the                                main focus of our project and we tackle                                this project from two different size                                improving the search and improving the                                field search page so here on the Left                                this you can see improving the search                                part and this is mainly to make learn to                                lower the chance that you                                end up on this field search page so this                                is basically relevance engineering and                                that's what we did                                so this is an example of something that                                we could improve in this way people are                                looking for laptop who's who says the                                Dutch word for sleeve unfortunately we                                have them in the system as a laptop                                sleeve so this is something we can                                improve well there are a lot of moving                                parts in in the search query before you                                get to the search results and there's a                                stemmer that's a de compound or there's                                we have synonyms we are indexing                                products we have an intensity                                recognition we have redirects in place                                to certain pages and so where to start                                what we did was we took the top thousand                                of field searches of the land of the                                previous three months and set down with                                the content team and really went line by                                line so okay what is the reason that                                this turned up - we have no search                                results and basically be improved in                                this way all of these different moving                                parts a little bit and but then you can                                still of course still end up on the                                field search page so what we did there                                was ok can we find ways to increase the                                conversion in the sessions with the                                field search so this is how it was I'm                                looking for daily paper and I'm having                                an empty search page and but now we have                                an following that's here it goes ok so I                                look for something this is a bearish and                                so at least this is already improved we                                still say sorry we cannot find what you                                were looking for but we now show at                                least a recommender so this is the last                                few the last few items and we also added                                some links to the categories but for                                certain search phrases we around                                      believe                                we can improve so we had the previous                                example of Bailey paper this is a                                popular brand but unfortunately we don't                                sell it but thankfully we have customers                                that were not satisfied with no as an                                answer and we sat down together with                                data science and they came up with an                                alternative search phrase recommender so                                that's what you can see here so these                                 are enough customers while we're looking                                 for daily paper ended up also searching                                 for something else then this will be                                 added to the alternative search phrases                                 and similarly we have alternatives                                 search results so this is also                                 recommended based on daily paper                                 so maybe customers that were searching                                 for daily paper ended up buying these                                 products and if enough customers do that                                 then apparently there's a link between                                 this daily paper brands which we don't                                 have and these items and you can see you                                 can give some examples that it works                                 pretty well Francis the be nosy is a                                 brand of colorful children's clothes and                                 this brand we don't have but we do sell                                 colorful children's clothes so this is                                 pretty nice some more examples rain cape                                 we don't have that we have done but we                                 have them as rain poncho or rain jacket                                 so I think our customer will be                                 satisfied for ending up with this field                                 search page and another example could be                                 epic socks it's also a brand this time                                 of colorful socks we also don't have                                 that but we do have colorful socks and                                 then we share these                                 so this is what I wanted to tell you if                                 I show you and if you want to know more                                 about maybe a little bit about the                                 algorithms feel free to ask me in the                                 chat or later in the social and but for                                 now please stay safe and thank you                                 fantastic thank you very much purpose do                                 we have any questions I'm just going to                                 hop into the history now oh here we go                                 yes we have a question from Andrew how                                 do you know what's related to the brand                                 that you do not sell well for instance                                 that that the daily paper one there's                                 other customers that also were searching                                 for daily paper but they ended up                                 searching for other things too a brand                                 that also sells hoodies and if you know                                 if a customer's do that then you and                                 then you did and ends up as a                                 recommendation so in that way we we are                                 confident that there's a link between                                 those big brand and those search phrases                                 so you're crowdsourcing as links                                 effectively between the brain yes yeah                                 fantastic thank you do we have any other                                 questions for Philippa sir shall we move
