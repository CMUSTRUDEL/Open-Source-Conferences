	                              [Music]                               so hello everyone my name is mark gala                               I am from Microsoft and I'm an open                               software lead for Microsoft and my job                               is to work with governments and                               organizations to help them release the                               power of data that's held within their                               organizations so today I'm going to talk                               to you about open data and the business                                potential of open data of course coming                                from Microsoft I'm going to talk about                                technology but I'm not really going to                                go into technology in too much detail                                and my where I'm coming from about                                technology is really how we can use                                technology to unleash the business value                                of open data I will allow some time at                                the end for questions so I'll make sure                                that you guys if there's things that you                                need me to clarify as we go along I'll                                make sure that we have time at the end                                for you to ask me questions I just like                                to thank the the organizers and mirko in                                particular for inviting us to present at                                this event it's it's been a great event                                with lots of different things going on                                and I I hope you enjoy this session as                                well so before I get into detail about                                the business potential for open data I                                kind of want to set the scene I know                                many of you here are familiar with open                                data concepts and open government                                initiatives and it's interesting that                                we're already starting to see some clear                                evidence of business value coming out of                                open government and open data                                initiatives worldwide and this this                                value the value of course has occurs                                differently depending upon who were                                looking at who we're talking about from                                a citizen perspective citizens really                                want better services right they want to                                be engaged by the government in ways                                that suit them rather than the way that                                government decides it's convenient for                                them to engage citizens for government                                workers government workers wants acts                                to date out they want to know understand                                how best to improve government and how                                to deliver better citizen services and                                for leaders of course leaders want to                                connect with the citizens and                                communities more broadly you know in                                broader ways more inclusive ways and                                ways that really drive innovation into                                the economy so this is kind of the                                backdrop for the potential for open data                                and open government initiatives while                                this is happening we're also seeing                                changes and opportunities arising out of                                technology development consumers of                                course now have a variety of different                                devices they have mobile devices PCs                                Android devices iOS devices it's and                                citizens are expecting to be engaged the                                way they want to be engaged the way it's                                convenient for them in addition to this                                we're seeing a massive explosion of                                available data you think about it                                data is now hitting us every day in a                                variety of different ways and                                particularly when we look at the amount                                of data that can potentially be shared                                by governments and when we look at                                things like big data that's coming out                                of science research the academic the                                academic world there is a ton and                                growing amounts of data that can                                potentially drive business value in the                                economy also we see a rise in the                                availability of cloud computing cloud                                computing is driving down the cost of                                being able to develop new applications                                and services and cloud computing is also                                driving the ability to use a variety of                                different devices access devices                                different types of software different                                types of hardware even so because of                                this backdrop we see worldwide many many                                open government initiatives and open                                data projects occurring we see them                                occurring in different countries in                                different regions we see them occurring                                in developed nations and emerging                                markets it's very interesting I was                                recently working with the World Bank and                                the World Bank are actually tying some                                of their investment funding to countries                                that are demonstrate                                 their ability to exploit open data for                                 business value so it's interesting that                                 we're starting to see some of these in                                 ties with investment and economic                                 activity even at national level in some                                 countries of course open data is                                 occurring at a federal level or national                                 level top down as we say so that would                                 be the case in the UK and the USA for                                 example but in other countries we're                                 seeing it occur from the bottom up where                                 there isn't a national policy or maybe                                 not a mature national policy around open                                 data and what we see is that cities and                                 states are actually driving the thinking                                 and driving the adoption of open data in                                 their countries and the reason for this                                 is quite simple if you think about it                                 open data becomes more meaningful                                 meaningful meaningful to us as                                 individuals when it has local relevance                                 so if I give you a very simple example                                 if we take say like flu virus so if we                                 look at statistics around flu virus a                                 nation may publicize that there are so                                 many cases of flu virus or occurring or                                 growing at a national level well this is                                 interesting and obviously we be                                 concerned and we hope the government is                                 doing something about the flu virus but                                 if we now know that there are                                          of flu virus in the school district when                                 my children go to school now I can take                                 action as an individual this means                                 something to me as an individual and so                                 this is why we often see city data and                                 local data becoming more frank frankly                                 more interesting and more exciting to us                                 as individuals and we see a lot of                                 applications and services being                                 developed around that data one of the                                 other things that we're seeing from a                                 technology perspective is of course an                                 important some reliance on open data                                 standards open standards and one of the                                 ones I'm going to talk to you today is                                 something called OData which is really                                 enabling cloud platforms to make it very                                 easy to get data into cloud platforms in                                 a very open way and to get it out of                                 cloud platforms in a very open way so                                 let's look at some examples of business                                 value this is the open business track                                 after all and I think that's what you                                 really interested in his okay great but                                 what is what are we seeing in terms of                                 business value for open data we're                                 already seeing some examples I mean this                                 is a very difficult subject there is no                                 clear answers to all of this today but                                 we already seen some evidence and some                                 examples of how business value is being                                 driven out of the use of open data there                                 are studies of course the Australian                                 Bureau of Statistics have done studies                                 which show that the economic value of                                 open data in Australia is worth around                                                                                                    should say at a cost of around less than                                                                                                          an interesting ratio I'm going to talk a                                 bit more detail about this in a second                                 another example of course many of you                                 will be familiar with the European                                 Commission that's done a study on public                                 sector information reuse of psi in                                 across the EU and the stated value the                                 economic value of that data is around                                    billion euros in Canada they discovered                                 that by using open data for fraud                                 detection of charities they could                                 potentially realize the saving to the                                 government and to the taxpayer of around                                                                                                     simply done what they did was they rated                                 charities in terms of charitable                                 contributions from highest to lowest and                                 it turned out that the top two charities                                 on the list nobody ever heard of so                                 there was a fraudulent activity being                                 can be incurring here and this was                                 realized through the publishing of open                                 data and of course a very well-known                                 example the apps for apps for democracy                                 competition that was done by Washington                                 DC the city of Washington DC they had an                                 apps for an apps development competition                                 using their open datasets which                                 generated                                                               of                                                                  value to the city of these applications                                 was around                                                             the outlay cost for them was only                                    thousand dollars so again another                                 example of business value being driven                                 out of the publishing of open data so                                 some other examples we can see there                                 have been various surveys and studies                                 done in different countries and I'm not                                 going to go into this chart in detail                                 but what I want to draw your attention                                 to is that the business value of dates                                 are changes depending upon the nature of                                 the data itself so if we look here you                                 will see that in particular geospatial                                 data GIS data data that has mapping and                                 location information in it in particular                                 has a rich of out tends to have a richer                                 value than say traditional government                                 data maybe government data about                                 government facilities or budgeting                                 things like that and the reason this is                                 very interesting is there's two reasons                                 first of all it talks back to this point                                 about value ratio you remember in the                                 earlier slide I said that the Australian                                 Bureau of Statistics have done studies                                 that show the ratio of value to cost                                 with open data is around five to one                                 when you look at geospatial data GIS                                 data that goes up to actually greater                                 than twenty to one ratio so that's why                                 that's interesting is depending o can                                 the value can vary depending upon the                                 data type but the second reason this is                                 interesting is because it also talks to                                 the point about governments being able                                 to make money out of open data and I                                 know for some of you this might be kind                                 of counterintuitive you might be                                 thinking well surely all open data has                                 to be free and of course there's a                                 there's an argument to say that that                                 should be the case what I would say                                 though is that you can have open data                                 and you can have free open data of                                 course but I would also say that what it                                 does is it enables governments to be                                 more legitimate about the situations                                 where they can charge a fee for a data                                 service that they're actually providing                                 and these two in my opinion are not                                 mutually exclusive so what I mean by                                 that is today I mean we're being shared                                 data is being provided to us by the                                 government every day so today in Canada                                 if I want to get a building permit one                                 way I can do that is I can go into my                                 local town hall and I can go to the city                                 clerk and they can print out a form and                                 they give me a building permit based on                                 some criteria of course and they get                                 charged a fee for that and that fee                                 really is a processing fee it doesn't                                 really add value to the process per se                                 it's just enable that Clark to give me a                                 bit of paper with a building permit on                                 it and yet if I share that data online                                 the government doesn't really need to                                 charge me for that right I'm a taxpayer                                 already you know there's an argument to                                 say I already have rights to that data                                 and so I think this this data value                                 concept creates a very interesting                                 discussion and kind of forces encourages                                 governments to be more legitimate about                                 where they're adding value to a service                                 on which basis they can legitimately                                 charge for that data so this is                                 something we're thinking about so as we                                 look at publishing of open data we're                                 also learning that just publishing open                                 data itself it's it's it's it's it's not                                 the end of the story and just walking                                 around today some of the other                                 presentations some of the work that's                                 being done in Germany Austria                                 Switzerland is very very impressive in                                 terms of setting up data portals open                                 data portals open data catalogs but if                                 we're really going to realize the                                 business value of open data just                                 publishing in a catalog it's one                                 activity but it's it's we need to do                                 more than this and if you look at this                                 diagram what we're kind of illustrating                                 here is that open data is an important                                 part of an overall government                                 information architecture and it's                                 important that data is shared in a way                                 that it's open of course that goes                                 without saying but also that we can take                                 data from different sources various                                 operational systems perhaps various                                 external sources we can provide data in                                 a way that it's easy to mash up and that                                 it's easy to consume by citizens with                                 different access devices and different                                 access methods but also by developers to                                 build new data and services with that                                 new app new applications and services                                 with that data because if we just share                                 data in a catalog and nobody uses it or                                 no applications or services are built                                 with it then we're not reason realizing                                 the business value of that data okay so                                 we're going to talk a bit more about                                 that as we go through this this                                 presentation so now it's it's an                                 opportune moment for us to talk about                                 cloud because given that we're saying                                 well we want to release                                 we want to enable business value out of                                 open data we can look at different types                                 of technology but a real enabling                                 technology that's out there today are                                 cloud platforms cloud platforms are                                 ideal for encouraging or enabling the                                 business value and business potential of                                 open data why is this first of all                                 clouds are highly scalable cloud                                 platforms are highly scalable you can                                 start low you can start with small                                 amounts of data you can increase the                                 amount of data and the amount of                                 transactions related to your data in a                                 very scalable way but still in a very                                 cost-effective way and I'm going to give                                 you some examples of this as we go                                 through secondly the the entry cost the                                 cloud is is minimal I mean and I mean                                 minimal it's almost zero we have we've                                 worked with customers in small cities in                                 North America where they've built new                                 open data portals in a couple of days                                 and they're running their entire open                                 data catalog for less than                                               month just to give you an idea so cloud                                 is very affordable very cost effective                                 start small scale up to high thirdly                                 cloud is very open so the cloud                                 platforms enable you to put bring data                                 in in from various sources in various                                 formats various standards and it's very                                 easy to get data out of the cloud in a                                 very open way independent of the access                                 device browser or whatever it might be                                 so let me give you one example of this                                 concept of scalability in the cloud one                                 application that's been developed some                                 of you may be familiar with it this was                                 an application service developed in                                 conjunction with the European                                 Environment Agency and it's called eye                                 on earth and what I on earth does I on                                 earth enables the publishing of air air                                 quality water quality and noise quality                                 data across the European Union and                                 what's very interesting about this                                 application is it make it makes it very                                 easy to connect with citizens and to                                 enable citizens to vote and to assess                                 the quality of that data                                 and the way they do this is with a very                                 simple SMS enabled device so why would                                 they do that well you can imagine if the                                 European Environment Agency is                                 publishing this data they are using                                 citizens to tell them if this data is                                 accurate or not is is the water quality                                 accurate or not where I am so what's                                 great about this is the government                                 saying okay all the government agency in                                 this case is saying here we think the                                 water quality at this location is X we                                 think it's good but the citizen can                                 actually vote or rate the quality of the                                 data at that location by saying well I'm                                 there what is this location on here it's                                 it looks like it's all Czech Republic in                                 this particular example I'm actually at                                 that location and I can tell you that                                 the water quality is bad and so they're                                 using crowdsourcing to help them                                 understand about the quality of water                                 air and noise in a particular area and                                 whether or not they need to do something                                 about that it might be a data issue of                                 course but it might be a genuine water                                 quality issue and so this is a way that                                 the European Environment Agency are                                 engaging citizens in helping them                                 improve the overall quality of their                                 service in the UK I'm sure many of you                                 are familiar with daily gov UK data UK                                 runs on the front end runs on the seek                                 an open source portal I'm sure many of                                 you are familiar with it but the back                                 end for whether data runs on Windows                                 Azure which is a which is a cloud                                 computing platform which is the cloud                                 computing platform from Microsoft and                                 the reason that they chose Azure was                                 because of the sheer volume of data and                                 transactions that's going through this                                 weather data this is national weather                                 data that's updated appley and published                                 to date or gov you K so you can imagine                                 how big and how heavy that data is plus                                 it potentially can be accessed by all                                 the citizens across the UK and frankly                                 the world so this is a great another                                 great example of how cloud computing can                                 provide scale and accessibility and                                 openness at very very low cost another                                 example I want to give you is a                                 campaigning open data with social media                                 this is a great way again to to provide                                 that citizen engagement you know early                                 on we talked about this is why one of                                 the reasons open data is being published                                 is to make the connection with the                                 citizens to to to engage citizens in                                 making the service or the the provision                                 that the government is making easier or                                 better quality so what we're seeing is                                 that open data applications and open                                 data services are being combined with                                 social media to make a better connection                                 with the citizens and to reach more                                 citizens to broader inclusion more                                 inclusive of different types of citizen                                 groups so this is an example of an                                 application called flood alerts on                                 Facebook and what this application does                                 is it just gives you a warning about                                 where floods may be occurring in the UK                                 and again if you think about the access                                 that people would have through Facebook                                 and through other devices you want to                                 make sure that this service is provided                                 independent of that access cloud compute                                 it let cloud computing lends itself very                                 well to these open scenarios and of                                 course mobile apps I'm sure many of you                                 are using mobile apps already with open                                 data if we put data in the cloud we can                                 develop apps or encourage the                                 development of apps on Android on iOS on                                 Windows                                                               for Windows                                                       developed for mobile uses based on that                                 data.gov data that I mentioned earlier                                 on so let me give you some facts and                                 figures about some of these applications                                 just again to bring home the scalability                                 of this data and how cloud really                                 enables this data to be used for                                 business value so first of all that                                 weather data that I mentioned earlier on                                 there are about                                                          that are updated per hour the cloud is                                 ideal for enabling this to happen at of                                 in a very cost-effective and open way                                 for Transport for London they share near                                 real-time dates are about the London                                 Underground trains this is the number                                 one most popular open data solution                                 across Europe and it gets about                                     million hits per day                                 all kinds of mobile applications running                                 on different operating systems this data                                 is stored in the cloud and again this is                                 an ideal example of why you would put                                 this data in the cloud making it                                 available to different types of services                                 and many many citizens across the                                 country and potentially across Europe                                 just to give you an idea when Transport                                 for London implemented this service it                                 actually represented a cost saving for                                 them from an infrastructure point of                                 view of around                                                        I'm going to talk a little bit about the                                 technology here but actually instead of                                 talking about and I'm going to give you                                 a quick demo so Microsoft have a couple                                 of offerings that enable data to be                                 published in the cloud one is called the                                 open government data initiative or OGD I                                 some of you may have heard of it some of                                 you may even be working with it o GDI                                 is basically an open API that sits on                                 the cloud it makes it very easy to get                                 data into the cloud and it makes it very                                 easy to get data out of the cloud the                                 data component of ng di is basically                                 enables you to set up a self-service                                 open data portal on the windows azure                                 system and you can put data in in a                                 variety of formats and you can get data                                 out in a variety of formats the data lab                                 code we make available as open source                                 available on github so it's a free open                                 source solution I know that may be a                                 surprise to you because I'm speaking                                 from Microsoft so I'll say it again it's                                 a free open source solution available                                 from Microsoft enabling you to easily                                 get data into the cloud and out of the                                 cloud this is an example of the the                                 interface but I'd like to actually show                                 you this because there's a couple of                                 really cool features that really talk to                                 this open aspect very well would you                                 guys like to see a demo rather than you                                 sitting up here talking about it yes                                 great so just party                                 I switch out here                                 okay so what we're looking at here this                                 is the interface of the OG di which is                                 this open API so one of the things I can                                 do I can switch the language here so                                 I'll switch it over to German and I'm                                 just going to pick I'm gonna pick a data                                 source here just kind of at random by                                 the way those of you who like to see the                                 Microsoft guys squirm when they're doing                                 a demo in case the demo goes wrong this                                 could be the bit that will really                                 entertain you so we'll see how it goes                                 what I'm going to do is I'm going to                                 pick let's see we'll pick an Austrian                                 example                                 and I'll just pick so I'm just going to                                 filter on one of the Austrian data sets                                 so I'm just going to pick one of these                                 and we'll have a look inside the data so                                 what you're looking at here this is a                                 portal set up for the with European                                 Union data by the way                                 so this Web the web interface the frame                                 that you see on the outside this is                                 running in a traditional web                                 infrastructure so it's hosted on premise                                 it's in a typical it's a typical web                                 application this component here the API                                 that you're seeing is actually running                                 in the cloud so what you can see is that                                 the cloud and your regular web                                 infrastructure are very seamless so the                                 fact that this data is hosted in the                                 cloud and running in the cloud we don't                                 know we don't really care it's very                                 seamless so what you're seeing here is                                 we're looking into the data set so this                                 is just a snapshot of the data set if                                 I'm a citizen I can use this to browse                                 the data if I'm a developer I can use it                                 to check it's the data that I'm really                                 interested in but I want to show you a                                 feature of this that really demonstrates                                 the openness of the cloud platform                                 so here you can see a developer                                 interface and what this does is it not                                 only publishes the data for citizens but                                 it also enables drives it drives the the                                 the publishing of the code for different                                 app different developer tools so if I                                 click on the drop down here you can see                                 there's some ASP code so this API                                 supports different development tools so                                 it's very independent of those                                 development tools so if I click on PHP                                 you will notice in a second that we can                                 generate code in different formats PHP                                 Python Ruby etc etc and what this means                                 is that the developer all they have to                                 do is to pick that code out of this API                                 and drop it straight into their                                 application and what's really good about                                 this is that it kind of addresses two                                 challenges that governments have when                                 they're publishing data one what format                                 and what standard do I need to publish                                 the data in number two how do I                                 encourage developers to take up this                                 data so this API really addresses that                                 middle ground of those challenges and                                 does both it it makes it easy for                                 governments to publish data in an open                                 way and it makes it easy for developers                                 to consume that data okay                                 so back to the presentation                                 another offering that Microsoft makes                                 available is something called data                                 market so you remember earlier on when I                                 said that using the cloud governments                                 have the opportunity to share open data                                 in a free way they also have the                                 opportunity to provide data to for                                 commercial use which enables them to                                 charge a fee for that data as I                                 mentioned earlier these things these two                                 things do not necessarily have to be                                 mutually exclusive it can be the same                                 data set stored in the cloud but I can                                 provide a free offering and I can                                 provide a commercial offering and again                                 our expectation is a commercial offering                                 would have some value-added service that                                 the government provides on top of it so                                 as a citizen or a developer I have the                                 choice I can take the free open data                                 offering if that's what I want the raw                                 source anonymized data or I can take the                                 commercial offering where the government                                 has provided some value-added service on                                 top of that data and again where we                                 commonly see these value-added services                                 in rich data like geospatial data where                                 they're doing mapping work with it                                 ordnance survey for example etc etc                                 there's many examples that around the                                 world where government agencies are                                 providing that data on a commercial                                 basis the other thing that's important                                 about this data is that it's easy to get                                 in and out of our existing                                 infrastructure so as we know many                                 government workers have different                                 productivity tools and so not only is it                                 important for us to get that data out in                                 an open way to citizens and developers                                 but we also want it to make it easy for                                 government analysts to use that data for                                 internal mashup purposes so again I'm                                 going to attempt to give you a quick                                 demo of how this can be done in a very                                 open way with the data that's available                                 in the cloud so again just bear with me                                 for a second                                 so what I have here is a data catalog                                 that was built by the Italian Ministry                                 of Health so again I'm just going around                                 these are real live open data sites so                                 I'm just going around from site to site                                 just to pick out data just again to show                                 you how easy this is and how open this                                 really is with the cloud computing                                 platform but what I'm going to do is I'm                                 going to do a very simple query here and                                 I want you to see what happens to the                                 UFL as I do that simple query                                 by the way my Italian isn't great so I'm                                 kind of working in the dark here so what                                 we've done there is either I've selected                                 a very simple query string and I've just                                 extracted the data out of this data set                                 which is equal to                                                      as a health data set and the code                                 represents something for the Italian                                 Ministry of Health I don't know what it                                 what it does but but what I wanted to                                 show you was that I can do a basic query                                 and notice what this API does it builds                                 that URL for me okay and if you remember                                 Tim berners-lee's criteria for open data                                 he says that obviously it's good for                                 governments to share data they get one                                 star for that they get two stars if they                                 share it in a proprietary format machine                                 readable they get three stars if they                                 share it in an open format and they get                                 four stars if they share it using open                                 you are eyes and that's what this is and                                 I want to show you give you one example                                 of why this is very powerful so what I'm                                 going to do is I'm going to copy that                                 you're all right that's all I'm going to                                 do                                 so now what I'm going to do is I'm going                                 to launch Excel and I'm going to launch                                 a feature of Excel called power pivot                                 and what power pivot and these one ables                                 me to do is it enables me to connect to                                 any open data feed and I'll just show                                 you how this works hopefully it's going                                 to work so at the top here for those of                                 you have used Excel                                                      a doubt free downloadable extension in                                 Excel                                                                 gets added to the the the menu bar at                                 the top this is the customer preview of                                 Excel                                                                  going to work let's see                                 so what i'm doing here is i'm using                                 powerpivot to access this Oh data feed                                 so again think of me as a business                                 analyst in this scenario I have no idea                                 what that what day - this format of what                                 format this data is in I have no idea                                 what the source data is in I'm just                                 using an open data standard to get this                                 data into my productivity tool                                 so this will probably take a little                                 while because it depends on the internet                                 connection and like I said hopefully                                 it's going to work so what I've just                                 done there is I've taken data out of an                                 open cloud repository and I have just                                 brought it in through an open data feed                                 into my productivity tool and this is                                 using an underlying protocol called                                 OData OData is a protocol that's jointly                                 developed by Microsoft IBM sa P Citrix                                 and other organizations and it enables                                 me to get data in and out of cloud and                                 in and out of other data set data                                 applications and service services in a                                 very open easy way so what you've just                                 seen is that I might as a data analyst I                                 can take data out of an open data                                 catalog in a very easy seamless open way                                 and I don't need to know what source                                 data it is I don't need to know what                                 format it is I can just use these open                                 data feeds to move data around                                 and that's what you saw                                 and that's what you see in this diagram                                 here but what I've done is rather than                                 talk to the slide I've just given you a                                 quick demo of that okay the other thing                                 we're seeing with open data and that it                                 is also enabled by this ability to mash                                 up data from different sources is that                                 government agencies are now using this                                 data and combining it with big data                                 sources and performance data from                                 different departments this is being used                                 internally for governments to provide                                 mashup applications and also dashboards                                 this one is from the city of Barcelona                                 that was recently developed so it                                 combines open data it combines internal                                 performance data and it combines sources                                 of big data together and again the cloud                                 is really really ideal at doing this so                                 with that I'm going to kind of wrap up                                 here and give her have open up for                                 questions                                 so really what we're talking about is                                 the is-is-is and having cloud in                                 enabling the business value of open data                                 enabling it to be realized the cloud                                 enables new innovative applications and                                 services to be built on those data sets                                 it enables data to be easily published                                 by governments in a very open way                                 independent of the access device or                                 software it enables new applications and                                 services themselves to be built in the                                 cloud at very low cost and yet it also                                 allows very high scalability big data                                 millions and millions of transactions                                 millions and millions of updates to                                 millions and millions of citizens and of                                 course it enables tremendous insight                                 both the government workers but also                                 citizens as well so I hope you enjoyed                                 that it was a quick tour through open                                 data from a Microsoft perspective and                                 I'll open up to the floor for questions                                 [Applause]                                 yes                                 thank you very much I was curious about                                 your revenue stream in your department                                 what what's gonna what's how do you make                                 money in your department working with                                 open government data how do I make money                                 personally so I think use your question                                 about how does Microsoft make money yeah                                 yeah so it's a good it's a good it's a                                 good question so quite frankly the way                                 Microsoft makes money out of this is by                                 data being hosted on our cloud platform                                 so you might think aha that's the catch                                 you know Microsoft is wants to make                                 money out of this well of course we're a                                 commercial organization that kind of                                 goes without saying however I want to                                 give you some examples of what kind of                                 revenues we're talking about so we've                                 done work with many different cities                                 many different government agencies                                 national state and city level and just                                 to give you an idea of the kind of costs                                 we're talking about the city of Berlin I                                 think the populations what about                                     million                                                                  so just to give you an idea and you                                 can't quote me on this but if I was to                                 estimate if we took all of the data that                                 the city of Berlin has and we hosted it                                 in the cloud the way I showed you the                                 way I demonstrated here it would cost                                 around                                                                  this method                                 so of course Microsoft has an interest                                 in this from a commercial point of view                                 but really it for us it's about cloud                                 adoption and getting different open                                 projects open source projects open data                                 projects running on our open cloud                                 platform more so than revenue and that's                                 kind of why I want to give you that                                 example thank you any other questions                                 yes                                 for me it seems to be too easy to get                                 into this solutions sorry                                 can you me okay for me it seems to be                                 too easy to get this solution because                                 normally in IT projects you have                                 aggregation of data we have difficult                                 processes there and the data quality                                 itself for big data is an enormous                                 problem so you mentioned that you get                                 revenues for billions from these                                 projects can you explain it in more                                 detail yeah so just to be just to                                 clarify I wasn't saying that the                                 Microsoft gets revenues of millions from                                 from this data                                 I guess it's potential that                                 organizations could get you know                                 obviously its potential for                                 organizations developers communities                                 citizen groups to get to get to monetize                                 the value of the data coming out of the                                 cloud okay but I think youyou mentioned                                 a couple of things there which I'll                                 address which I think I think is the nub                                 of your question so first of all you                                 were talking about the complexity of                                 getting data out of operational systems                                 so this would be done with traditional                                 kind of ETL tools extract transform load                                 tools but of course because of the                                 openness of the cloud because of the                                 open API capabilities it's relatively                                 easy to do that I'm trying to be careful                                 with my statements I don't wanna make it                                 sound like yeah you can do any data                                 anytime and but as I said with the with                                 the OData protocol as an example it's                                 it's it's deliberate design is to enable                                 data to be easily more easily published                                 into the cloud and more easily taken out                                 of the cloud but of course there will be                                 complexities getting data out of some                                 operational systems these complexities                                 are known and you know there's various                                 tools that you can and techniques you                                 can use to do that the second party I                                 think you mentioned big data of course                                 big data is a challenge because with the                                 volumes of data perhaps in a regular                                 updates feeding automated automatic                                 feeds that kind of thing and of course                                 this is where we see different                                 technologies working together in a way                                 to make that easy to happen so with                                 Microsoft's Windows Azure cloud platform                                 for example we will work very similarly                                 with hey do that that would be our one                                 way that we would get big data source                                 is in and out of our cloud platform and                                 again we can still use the Oh data                                 protocol to get that data out so from a                                 cloud point of view it almost doesn't                                 care because it scales so well let me                                 give you another example actually                                 quickly because I think it illustrates                                 this very well                                 okay so what you're looking at here and                                 this kind of hopefully this kind of                                 illustrates the the big data and                                 real-time nature of this this is a it's                                 a live train map of the London                                 Underground and if you watch the the                                 icons that are actually moving in                                 near-real-time and that this is using                                 that Transport for London data I showed                                 you earlier on so this interface is                                 built using Google Maps and I think it                                 uses some PHP code at the back end but                                 again showing the openness of the cloud                                 the backend data is being fed through                                 cloud through the windows azure platform                                 and you can see that there's a                                 tremendous amount of data that's being                                 generated at the backend here and you                                 can see that the the you know the                                 updates and the the the way the                                 application works in a very simple way                                 that update is almost seamless from an                                 end-user point of view so I think this                                 illustrates quite well how a simple                                 application can use near real-time data                                 that generated live through the                                 Transport for London API okay any other                                 questions                                 Nicko do you know what my question is                                 going to be I would like to hear how the                                 OData standard is developed especially                                 how the development process is governed                                 and if I could implement access to it                                 from a purely free software based                                 solution so let me take the second part                                 I mean it's an open protocol it's it's                                 currently up for open standards                                 ratification by the Oasis committee so                                 and again you know it's it's a                                 consortium of IBM Microsoft's sa P                                 Citrix as far as I'm concerned you could                                 use any free software or any open-source                                 technology to to access it and indeed if                                 you go on to OData org you will see many                                 examples of where that's been done as to                                 the development process it's it's just                                 Michelle it's a consortium of                                 organizations and we are developing the                                 protocol to be as open as we you know                                 practically can make it and you know                                 it's a collaborative process between                                 those different commercial organizations                                 and as I said we put it up for radical                                 open standards ratification with with                                 the Oasis committee so that's something                                 that's in progress it's made available                                 under the open specification promise                                 yeah okay thank you very much for                                 listening and I'm available if you guys                                 have any other follow-up questions but                                 thank you for staying awake                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]
