Publication date: 2020-02-21
Playlist: Summit of Newthinking #SON12
Description: 
	China is opening up to communicate to the rest of the world it's chinese culture in hopes that greater understanding can be formed between its 5,000 year history, and it's new found identity. Anina has the pleasure to be the first foreigner to work directly with the CHIC Fashion Expo to educate the fashion industry on how to use mobile technology in their retail business and brand building. What has been possible for her to achieve successfully in China was due to the ability to embrace a 360 degree point of view.

doing over there in the land of thatch                               huts they don't live in that touch by                               the way so I'm just gonna tell you a                                little bit about me run you through my                                philosophy and then get over there to                                demo some cool stuff so we can come                                together into the virtual world and                                travel a thousands of miles all the way                                to pay King so just a little bit about                                me I'm a fashion model and a tech                                entrepreneur and I'm really passionate                                about empowering women with technology                                so everything that I do in the media I                                am always trying my best to portray                                women and Technology in such an                                attractive way that other women will                                love to get involved because I believe                                that we need more women to design                                technology for women to suit our                                multitasking lifestyles I speak all over                                the world at technology conferences like                                open strategies today and I'm very                                honored to be here and thank you very                                much to the open strategies team for                                bringing me so that I can share with you                                my very very faraway world in this world                                there's the fashion industry which is                                growing incredibly rapidly yet as you                                know not many people out here really                                know what's happening in China so you                                may ask yourself why are you talking                                about China when this is a conference                                about openness China itself is                                surrounded by the incredible firewall                                which we have to jump over a tunnel                                through and even pay to get to youtube                                right well the thing is is that there's                                a lot that can be done in China because                                in many ways they're very open because                                they have eradicated their entire                                history in many ways the things that I'm                                doing over there I could never do over                                here and I'll share with you some of the                                incredible things that when the Chinese                                say yes it is like a force of Moses                                parting the Red Sea and absolutely                                everything falls into place with that                                decision so in some ways when you get                                that yes you better be ready to move so                                I'd like to speak all over the world and                                try to encourage people that get into                                technology I have a game called the Nina                                dress up where you can dress me up in                                the latest style it was an adventure in                                itself trying to get it all connected to                                the Chinese social media oftentimes you                                need licenses a company to get the api's                                I'm also speaking in the web and other                                conferences I'm always trying to show                                how the Chinese culture is really trying                                to reach out and open up and show its                                new face to the world so China is big                                you know you can't really like lump it                                together there are people in the north                                people in the South I've seen so many                                different shapes and sizes that I can                                actually start to tell them apart the                                market itself I deal with mobile                                technology is really exciting because I                                tell you by                                                             in the market is a force that people                                better be ready to take advantage of                                because they are ready and they are                                interactive                                the other interesting thing about China                                is that because it's an emerging market                                as you can see television everybody                                pretty much has one although I threw                                mine away recently                                um internet as you move away from the                                first tier cities out to the rural areas                                you see a sharp decline in internet                                usage it's because they literally                                haven't dug the cables and laid down the                                infrastructure for it so for this part                                what's very interesting is you see                                mobile shooting in a rapid way up and                                today as you well know there are many                                people who will never know the internet                                through a computer and they will only                                know the Internet through a mobile                                device and I just laugh at at newspapers                                magazines and radio at their just                                 miniscule reach and yet people think                                 they still have power China is a                                 fragmented market                                 you can't go at it with your iPhone and                                 Android only mentality if you really                                 want to have reach you have to have a                                 social and a cross-platform approach so                                 what is it that we're doing over there                                 right well part of the reason that I                                 went over there is because when I was                                 doing all of this stuff over here                                 I just kept meeting with people that                                 would be like in                                                     blogs to the fashion industry they were                                 like why do I need a blog and it took                                 like two hours to explain it let alone                                 that they had to do it from their mobile                                 phones then when I was live streaming                                 from the pits of all the Fashion Week's                                 I was constantly getting bouncers who                                 wanted to throw me out and said you do                                 not have professional equipment I said                                 it has a Carl Zeiss lens so everything                                 that I ever did over here just reach                                 deaf ears                                 most likely because I was really far in                                 advance so at one point I said I'm out                                 of here I'm going where everybody plays                                 with their phone they all have blogs and                                 hey                                 I'm gonna become China's number one top                                 four model so we have this awesome                                 platform it's called mobile magazines                                 that when I tried to introduce it in the                                 West people were like well why would I                                 want to ever have it work in a low-end                                 handset you know and what do you mean                                 it's not constantly connected to the                                 internet it's a one-time download well                                 it's a link a flier app what it doesn't                                 move and shake and flee around but yet                                 in Africa India China and in these                                 third-world markets for example like                                 Australia where the operators are                                 starting to charge you for every single                                 megabyte and you can be sure it's coming                                 here soon to your handset this platform                                 I'm really proud

  think oh it's too simple but simple is                                 great because it works you click and                                 there's nothing that like happens that

                              products so as they go out throughout                                 your distribution channels into the                                 rural areas of China you can collect                                 back to you all those new customers and                                 users and these                                                        can go to the mobile magazine website                                 and download their flyer and check out                                 their brand and go to their website and                                 check out their Weibo I would love you                                 to know them because they are                                 ready to reach out and they are open we                                 also have this application pre-installed                                 on all and nine handsets and you might                                 say nokia is dead but it's not I'm                                 getting eighty thousand unique visitors                                 clicking per week on my app and showing                                 fashion brands and the thing that I                                 think was again very simple news                                 lookbook and then when you're on the                                 brand and you connect to the social it                                 searches all the social media and shows                                 you what everybody is saying about that                                 brand but why because Chinese shoppers                                 will absolutely shop in that way first                                 they'll listen to what their peers are                                 saying then they'll look at the pictures                                 and they'll read the professional news                                 and based on those three criteria they                                 will then consider to check out your                                 brand of course we have our news and                                 we're launching that in Chinese in                                 French and German I think we really have                                 to get multi multilingual and don't                                 forget Chinese simplified and Chinese                                 traditional and also launching this                                 iPhone app has been an incredible feat                                 because I made a mistake and put it on                                 Google servers which like you can't get                                 it out of that stuff so if you want to                                 put your app into China it is definitely                                 going to cost you and it is definitely                                 not going to be easy so what about these                                 four different technologies that I think                                 are the lowest hanging fruits and I                                 can't understand why nobody is using                                 them daily                                 augmented reality QR codes NFC and a                                 peepees it still amazes me that today in                                 the fashion industry                                 three people don't have QRS hanging off                                 of everything so I've been working for                                 the past year together with the Chinese                                 government building large-scale                                 exhibitions during the Fashion Week's                                 this is an                                                             where you have four walls all of which                                 are like                                                                excuse me                                 it's                                                                     on each wall I've played with the idea                                 of one technology a hundred and ten                                 thousand people walked through my                                 exhibition and learned how mobile                                 technology can be implemented in their                                 business so what I really wanted to                                 bring you today but for many logistical                                 reasons that didn't work out                                 is the                                                               reality wall of the China fashion                                 industry I'm really proud to say that it                                 was an incredible feat which took about                                 a month of plowing through all this old                                 footage but even for myself learning how                                 the industry started and then watching                                 as you walk down and use the augmented                                 reality to travel through time and to                                 experience the massive growth I've                                 brought for you today a small sample of                                 that and I hope that you will enjoy to                                 journey with me through                                                  in addition to that we used QR codes and                                 I showed the Chinese fashion brands how                                 they could incorporate them into their                                 retail space I think that we could                                 really in the fashion industry use more                                 of that as I demonstrated earlier                                 hanging them on art hang tags issuing                                 them in our posters and then we showed                                 NFC technology and if see I think has a                                 lot of resonance with fabrics so we work                                 together with the esmad school                                 and we had a wall with all these new                                 super fabrics hanging off of it and you                                 could take the phone and touch it to the                                 fabric and then it would display the                                 name of the fabric the properties of                                 each individual fabric size and even                                 click to go to the website of the                                 designer so imagine with me for a moment                                 you like my dress but I can't remember                                 the name of the designer so why is there                                 no chip inside that you can touch to my                                 collar that tells you the name of the                                 designer the properties of the fabric                                 and links me to connect to their                                 ecommerce store one of the reasons I                                 discovered in Shanghai when we did                                 another one of these exhibitions is with                                 the NFC chip manufacturer he said oh I                                 could make a waterproof chip so I feel                                 that we need to get together on both                                 sides of the fence on the technology                                 side on the fashion side and just as as                                 new thinking are doing collide them                                 together in the massive atom reactor so                                 that we can move them forward because                                 the technology often doesn't know what                                 the fashion needs and the fashion can't                                 imagine what the technology can do for                                 them so back to the wall the beautiful                                 beautiful wall                                                     traveling through time it was really                                 something that I felt I really wanted to                                 share with you today we just completed a                                 second exhibition during that second                                 China Fashion Week in October for the                                 young fashion brands a little bit                                 smaller scale but nonetheless the young                                 brands are really open to use these                                 technologies they understand that their                                 customer is hungry for information                                 they're hungry for interactivity and                                 they want anything that will help them                                 open and share their story more                                 and I'm really proud to say that my QR                                 code hangs on the on the face of the                                 Polish Embassy I almost passed out when                                 I when I walked past it they used it for                                 their cultural cultural week and it got                                 in two days over                                                    several tweets on the social media scale                                 so that's sort of what I'm doing is                                 building this bridge between fashion and                                 technology and I find that there's more                                 open and available people to do things                                 in China and now I'd like to go and                                 switch over to my app and I'd like you                                 to hear for yourself I have videos and                                 I'd love you to hear what the people                                 themselves are saying                                 [Music]                                 together with the China fashion                                 government and they had the first                                 Fashion Show                                 I love looking at these really old                                 pictures because it really shows what I                                 think is lacking today the old of the                                 history of China melded together with                                 the new modern silhouette and also they                                 have a very rich heritage of ethnic                                 style                                 this is at the China world
