Description: 
	The session will discuss the DIT experiment run by A Headful of Bees artist collective that showed how an independent artist can bring people together to help record, design, promote and release their own album and accompanied documentary film without spending money and instead using only skill swapping, bartering and collaborative working, while at the same time connecting with audiences in new and innovative ways.

         some music so it's just gonna play in                               the background you can kind of see and                               hear it so I'm not doing a formal                               presentation this is a little informal                               talk and workshops so yeah I'll start                               this my name is Erica cart and I'm a                                musician and I'm a member of an artist                                collective based in Berlin called a head                                full of beads so we are musicians and                                filmmakers writers photographers and we                                got together about                                                    each other with our careers all of us                                really loved our art but none of us were                                making money enough to live on from it                                so can I just ask the question here are                                all of you artists are you yes any are                                you an artist are you a musician or                                photographer or no yes you can I can I                                ask a personal question yeah do you make                                all of your money from art                                [Music]                                [Music]                                hello my name is Martin and I make money                                only by events not only not by selling                                my music playing on not solely from your                                music too no I don't sell my music I                                give my music and the internet for free                                but I want people to pay if they are                                listening to my music and come to clubs                                and where I play my friends so we had a                                similar situation where yeah none of us                                were making money from our art and                                nobody that we talked to was making                                money from their art they all had jobs                                I'm a web designer myself so I pay my                                rent through web design and I do music                                because I love music and it's really                                what I want to do I would rather do                                music for my living and do some web                                design just for a bit of fun but I                                haven't figured out how to do that yet                                so we did this project in September                                called vit do it together and it was a                                way of challenging this idea of a DIY of                                musician or a DIY artist because nobody                                really does it themselves so we kind of                                changed this idea from DIY to do di t do                                it together and what we did is I had                                songs that I wanted to record a new                                album so I wanted to do an album in one                                week I wanted to record it I wanted to                                design the album I wanted to film the                                whole process I wanted to promote the                                album I wanted to do everything that you                                do to release an album as an independent                                artist in a professional way which you                                normally will take about nine months or                                year even and I wanted to do it all in a                                week and I wanted to do it not in a                                recording studio I wanted to do it in a                                public place because I like this idea of                                an open source music project so we did                                it in its place embedding called super                                mock and it's an old kaiser's super Bock                                and it's                                                                it's not designed to record music in at                                all so we thought great this is where we                                want to record because the challenge is                                this idea that you have to be in a                                recording studio and you have to have                                sound separation you have to be in a                                vocal booth to be able to sing and we                                thought well let's do it in an unusual                                place let's invite the audience in to                                watch us do this so anybody could come                                in there's a cafe in there maybe you can                                see in some of the pictures there's a                                cafe in there people are coming and                                going and we want to capture this kind                                of mood of and the sounds of everyday                                life that's happening while you're doing                                this creative process and we wanted to                                kind of pull back the curtain so people                                can see how it is you do record an album                                most people have no idea how you do this                                and we thought this would be kind of                                taking this open source idea that this                                would be a nice way of pulling back the                                curtain and saying this is how you                                record an album and one of the other                                aspects of it is normally for an                                independent musicians we spend anywhere                                between                                                           record and promote an album that's kind                                of an average and I've done that myself                                we normally never recover this money                                 that was spent if you have to sell a lot                                 of CDs to be able to to cover ten                                 thousand euros or seven thousand euros                                 you have to tour an awful lot to be able                                 to cover that and even touring sometimes                                 you go in more debt touring than you did                                 without touring so we thought this                                 business model that independent artists                                 are using is broken so the first thing                                 we wanted to do is can we do can we make                                 an album without spending any money what                                 if we tried to go the extreme and say we                                 won't spend any money at all and this is                                 what we did with this project without                                 half how can we do this so long story                                 short cuz we only have a half an hour we                                 got                                                               engineers mixing engineers mastering                                 engineers graphic designers cameramen                                 and women                                 photographers and we put them all in                                 this one creative space and we ran                                 workshops for all these different                                 aspects of the music business if you                                 will we had our own music industry                                 happening in this one room during to one                                 week and                                                              did this for free without spending any                                 money so we weren't sure if it was going                                 to work or not we called in an                                 experiment from the beginning in case we                                 didn't have an album at the end we only                                 had two songs okay well great we've                                 recorded two songs so we took a little                                 pressure off ourselves we set a goal                                 we'd really like to do an album in a                                 week but we because we called it an                                 experiment it's okay if it fails because                                 we learned from him failure also but it                                 didn't fail it worked                                 yeah so we were able to do this and we                                 released the album under a Creative                                 Commons license so anyone can download                                 it or share it a remix it or use it for                                 any purpose as long as they are not                                 making money out of it so quite a broad                                 Creative Commons license                                 so there was a couple of key things here                                 number one was learning to work                                 collectively we brought a hundred people                                 together to see can you work                                 collectively can you imagine                                             together who tend to have a lot of ego                                 and can be diva a lot of the times would                                 this work bringing a hundred of them                                 together to work on one project and the                                 interesting thing about it I believe                                 from my perspective because we didn't                                 because no one was being paid and                                 everyone knew this upfront because they                                 knew that it was a project that was more                                 about the idea and the experiment than                                 it was about making money                                 people came at it they joined this                                 project because they really believed in                                 it and they really were inspired by it                                 and interested in it and because no one                                 was making money for some reason the                                 atmosphere totally changed and it became                                 quite a people really worked well                                 together people were very relaxed it was                                 very calm there wasn't any drama and we                                 got an awful lot of work done in fact we                                 had the backing tracks for the entire                                 album recorded in two days which was                                 well above our plan so                                 a couple of key things that have that                                 made it work one was working                                 collectively experimenting what this                                 does this work and number two was this                                 idea of a sprint which was can you do                                 nine months or seven months of creative                                 work in a week and still have a high                                 quality product at the end and there's                                 been many experiments in this before                                 oftentimes around books maybe you've                                 heard of books prints where you get a                                 number of authors together writers                                 together and give them five days to                                 write a novel book and it is quite                                 amazing the quality of the book that                                 comes out of only five days so have you                                 done this okay would you like to you                                 have will come tell us now no this was                                 an inspiration I met someone who had                                 been on a team that did a book sprint                                 and she has to write see I'm setting                                 this up for you yeah I'm only here for                                 you so we were challenging this idea                                 that that you have to bleed and struggle                                 this is the only path to make great arts                                 we were trying to challenge this and say                                 well why do you have to do this why                                 can't you why can't you do art quickly                                 why can't why can't you just - this                                 energy that exists when you put creative                                 people in the room and make something                                 positive out of it in a quick way so                                 this was the second kind of pillar if                                 you will of di T which was the idea of                                 the Sprint and the third pillar of it                                 was this idea of openness was trying to                                 engage with the audience in a new way                                 normally the only way we get to engage                                 with audiences they either listen to our                                 music                                 or download our music or they come to a                                 concert which is great but everybody                                 does that so as you can see we invited                                 people in they watched it not only us                                 record but they watched all those and                                 they participated in workshops to to do                                 the CDs I'm just gonna have a few of                                 this CDs each of the CDs were handmade                                 by people who came in we had a stack of                                 magazines maybe                                                       glue and scissors and a couple computers                                 set up and people just came in and made                                 their their own and they put their names                                 inside of who the artist is so I'll just                                 throw a few things                                 [Music]                                 [Music]                                 you might see in this picture here some                                 some kids we had one school from mid to                                 the Berlin cosmopolitan school that sent                                 about                                                               around                                                                   one day and we got them to record a                                 backing track but we got them the                                 stomping clapping the in the basement in                                 this big echoey basement and we used we                                 looped this this track to one of our                                 songs so we were trying to again even                                 just engage teenagers and how you record                                 an album and they ended up making a                                 number of these CD covers as well so the                                 last kind of pillar of the of the idea                                 di T was trying to find a new business                                 model for independent artists trying to                                 I mean we're artists and yet we tend to                                 follow very rigid lines of how you're                                 supposed to do things you know you have                                 as a musician we have to go into a                                 studio we have to spend a lot of money                                 we have to hire a PR agent we have these                                 structures that we think we have to do                                 in order to be successful and the fact                                 is most of us aren't successful you know                                 only a small number of musicians or                                 artists are actually living and making                                 money off from their art so you know if                                 we're not the ones out there challenging                                 the norms or the structures of it who                                 will so this was just an experiment to                                 kind of take all these different ideas                                 that have been floating around I've gone                                 to many music conferences I've spoken                                 that music conferences I've been to IT                                 conferences and open source conferences                                 and there's a lot of great ideas out                                 there but we tried to just take all the                                 ideas that we thought were really cool                                 and throw it into one project and see                                 does it work what worked and what didn't                                 work                                 so at the end of it we have an album                                 which is pretty cool we have a film                                 that's just finished being edited and is                                 coming out in the first of the year and                                 we have this experience of having gone                                 through this week of very intense very                                 productive and creative process so                                 that's my story and we're halfway                                 through our sessions so I want to know                                 what you think and you know challenge me                                 on what I'm telling you up here and see                                 if you have any questions at all who                                 wants to be first your you're a musician                                 so what you and you you don't sell your                                 music you give it and give it away and                                 I'm gonna ask it back on the mic                                 recession                                 so yeah yes this idea of giving away                                 music for free or giving away your                                 product for free yeah in my opinion I I                                 don't want people to write first rate                                 them give money for my music get music                                 from everywhere that I I upload my music                                 on YouTube and everywhere you can listen                                 to it but in a reduced sentence and I                                 make this experience that I brought a                                 little tax on it on the video and sell                                 to all the people okay listen if you                                 want my music to to play them for other                                 events by the way I'm making electronic                                 music like techno music and I told them                                 okay if you want my music don't Don to                                 ask me and I will give you extra version                                 Android version so to quality and it                                 works I upload a video of a song of mine                                 and after two days I got it under and an                                 email from another artist who asked me                                 take a listen man I want this song maybe                                 I can play it and they say okay sure you                                 can play it I don't want I don't even                                 more money for that you play this song                                 on an event in Poland so for me it was                                 good just to see ok my music they people                                 liked it and so step by step first I                                 want the people to get to know about me                                 maybe one year in two years there's a                                 label press of vinyl CD from these                                 sources I don't want                                 with saying to me okay ten years I won't                                 make money of no music in ten years they                                 started right now this is the problem                                 take so many time to make people love                                 your music and play or pay for it so                                 again it's it's a it's this idea that                                 there's there's different ways to                                 approach getting your your product out                                 there your art out there he's doing it a                                 very different way I sell music as well                                 I've sold albums for years                                 I'm not against making money from my                                 music or selling albums we still don't                                 know what we're going to do with the CDs                                 like we we have many CDs and I don't                                 know we're still trying to figure it                                 some of these things out but the but the                                 point of the project was and we're                                 starting from a place where we're not                                                                                                         creative now with with what we do we                                 don't have this pressure to we have to                                 sell a thousand CDs in order to pay back                                 this money we're trying to approach it                                 as a small business we're trying to                                 approach this whole idea as a startup                                 company as it says with a ten year plan                                 to try to get our product if you don't                                 mind me calling                                 music product to get it out there and                                 trying to reach the widest audience as                                 possible                                 yes                                 [Music]                                 I really like the this project and like                                 a few things to say that I found really                                 positive but also to questions or                                 critics now the things that it's really                                 interesting is like this connection you                                 said it just do it together it's                                 something more than to do it yourself                                 that maybe it's a bit old now that                                 everything it's open and we can share                                 everything with with Internet so like I                                 think that if someone it's a musician                                 and he plays and he record the album at                                 the same time he is not a sound engineer                                 only can do the design of the album or                                 he can do cooking or promotion because                                 that's not his job so if we connect and                                 we like I'm a designer and I would like                                 to make the cover of my book that's                                 that's really great and if you think                                 what what you did we also make a more                                 professional work we share the                                 competence in every field and then we                                 can have a better fit but it was really                                 good but my critical question is how                                 this album you made it's real it's                                 really your album like your product as                                 an artist or it's more a project like                                 something you did for the community                                 like I know people made the cover of the                                 album but most of the people who made                                 the single cover maybe they didn't                                 listen to the album or didn't know you                                 as a person maybe they didn't like it                                 maybe they didn't like it yes so that's                                 what's the first thing the second thing                                 it's okay you did this thing because the                                 starting point was we are not making                                 money out of the music but did you make                                 money how does this project know so that                                 was just yes                                 to make some question today I just have                                 to think about how can we alright so                                 that's a that's a good question I'll                                 start with the second question and and                                 you can just lay it there                                 we didn't make money on this project yet                                 I mean this project is only two months                                 old we're not we're not ruling out the                                 idea that maybe at some point there                                 could be some money made from this                                 project the question is what we do with                                 it and I am the songwriter it's my music                                 and so it is my project but it was a                                 community project and the whole idea                                 that is that I made it with                                            so I think it would be a nightmare to                                 try to take any money that I made and                                 share it with a hundred people I don't                                 even know some of these people and some                                 of them just came in off the street and                                 and so I mean they walked by this place                                 was all glass in the front so people                                 would walk by the street and see people                                 making music and they'd come in and say                                 what are you doing I said well we're                                 making an album and it's all cool can I                                 help                                 it's a great do you sing right ok well                                 in about an hour work we've got a choir                                 we're putting together we put a little                                 notice out on Facebook at two o'clock                                 tomorrow we need a choir and about                                    people showed up so we had a choir some                                 of them sang really good some of them                                 didn't sing so good we put them in the                                 back and we taught them two parts real                                 quick did some vocal exercises with them                                 and they sang in there on the album man                                 but I think what we would do if we did                                 make any money from this project is we                                 would just put it in towards doing                                 another D IT project and just recycle                                 the money for whoever's project is we                                 didn't do this project to say here's a                                 new business model we did this project                                 to say that to start thinking about the                                 challenge all the different aspects of                                 the current business model which isn't                                 working and tried to find ways where                                 maybe it could work a little better so I                                 mean you're a designer yeah you're not a                                 designer sorry okay so I mean I mean                                 there were people who were doing design                                 on us who aren't designers you know and                                 there were people who were singing who                                 aren't singers and people who were                                 helping with the sound engineering who                                 aren't sound engineers and but they had                                 a they were excited about the project                                 and they put their heart and their                                 passion into it and it shows                                 [Music]                                 I think I'm not I'm not really good at                                 it but I organize concert in Italy and                                 also that lets a do-it-yourself level                                 but of course has to be do it together                                 because to organize a concert I need a                                 band and the band to play need someone                                 to organize a concert so yeah can I can                                 I ask are you a musician or you yeah why                                 not okay                                 [Music]                                 No thank you no I'm just a marketing guy                                 yeah do you have a question for me                                 because I okay as a marketing person is                                 this sound insane is this crazy                                 this is like the idea because I mean the                                 music industry I mean it's probably the                                 industry with the most problems actually                                 things start happening and for me I just                                 like independent music I'm not the pop                                 guy or the big hard rock whatever guy I                                 just like in depending and I like like                                 it's kind of project just you know                                 because comes from the heart and people                                 just want to really want to make music                                 and I want to make money in first and so                                 it's not weird                                 no and I think maybe it's also a good                                 way of distributing music which is                                 unknown because you got a community                                 which is always a good point to start to                                 go out and get the stuff like known so                                 thanks for that it does come from this                                 kind of this project that come from this                                 community where as I mentioned I'm in an                                 artist collective and one of the things                                 we have been doing is we've been hitting                                 roadblocks we've been hitting we've been                                 trying to do things in the music                                 industry and haven't been successful for                                 instance like even just booking a tour                                 which I tried to book a tour when when                                 my album before this came out and I had                                 a list of venues and I contacted them                                 and nobody came nobody said yes and I                                 contacted radio stations and people to                                 review the album and and no one said yes                                 in fact one radio station that does live                                 performance I thought oh I'd be perfect                                 for this you know and I contacted them                                 they said no your music doesn't really                                 fit with our program what am I doing                                 wrong I was doing this as myself you                                 know as the artist so we formed this                                 collective well even before we formed a                                 collective I just got a Google email                                 address I came up with this name a head                                 full of bees actually my wife did and I                                 stole it from her and I just did a                                 Google a head full of bees at Google                                 Mail com and I contacted all this list                                 again but I took on a new name I was a                                 booking agent now and I gave myself a                                 new name and I was with a head full of                                 bees booking agency and suddenly the                                 same people who told me no told me yes                                 and in particular the radio station that                                 said my music didn't fit their program                                 came back and said when can we book you                                 or when can we put this artist you know                                 for me this was a real eye-opener you                                 know it was all right you know I'm                                 they're not taking me serious as a as a                                 DIY artists you know they're looking for                                 they're trying to filter out the rubbish                                 and think well if you've got a booking                                 agent and you've got a manager and you                                 got a record label then you must be                                 pretty good so okay so we've we've                                 formed a record label we said we're a                                 record label                                 we formed a booking agency we said we're                                 a booking agency and we did all these                                 things then collectively based on this                                 idea that worse were stronger together                                 and and we did a tour where we traveled                                 mid fog Allegan height around germany                                 and austria so and we were we did                                 couchsurfing for our accommodation and                                 we kept the costs really really low and                                 we ended up making money                                 we also crowd funded the tour also we                                 ended up making money at the end of it                                 but yeah we realized and a lot of the                                 shows we did were house concerts so we                                 were performing in people's bones in my                                 concerts and so we started a run of von                                 Zimmer sofa salon concert series here in                                 Berlin and we've done one every month                                 for two two years there's been like                                    phone Sameer concert so there is this                                 alternative infrastructure out there I                                 [Music]                                 know it's a bit sad but venues or radio                                 station they receive thousands of emails                                 every day and of course I have to make a                                 good selection and usually like the the                                 email from the single artist are the                                 first one not taking really seriously                                 not because the music it's bad but                                 because for a single email you don't                                 understand if they if they already                                 played a lot of concerts so if they are                                 good at playing or yeah things like that                                 it was it was quite a lesson in                                 marketing you know even this my last                                 album I tried to get an article in exper                                 linner because I'm I'm not from here                                 obviously and I really tried hard to get                                 them to review my album and they didn't                                 but                                 okay they didn't review the album but                                 this album they've already done an                                 article on it but they did it in their                                 open source they did a whole piece on                                 open source and for them this was an                                 open source project so you know even                                 doing a project like this most of the                                 media that we have gotten for this                                 project has been from internet startup                                 magazines has been some open source                                 magazines we are speaking at a open                                 source project so I'm now taking my                                 music into places that would have never                                 gotten into before if I just gone myself                                 into a studio and recorded this little                                 album by myself so yeah every aspect of                                 it is is trying to challenge the                                 traditional ways of creative production                                 if you will you know like I always have                                 some emails from booking agency whatnot                                 you know they are making they don't put                                 links to a place where I can listen to                                 the music or they put PDF of five pages                                 to describe one single artist because                                 they don't have marketing strategies                                 maybe witches are also needed hopefully                                 this is another thing hopefully brought                                 so many people together because we're                                 not very good at doing all these little                                 things and hopefully everyone has                                 something that they're good at and was                                 able to bring to it if you want to                                 listen to the album or download the                                 album or share it or remix it to do what
