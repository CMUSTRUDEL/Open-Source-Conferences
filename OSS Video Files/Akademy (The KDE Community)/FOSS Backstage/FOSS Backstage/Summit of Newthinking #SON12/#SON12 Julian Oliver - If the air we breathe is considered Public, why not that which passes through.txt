	Full title: If the air we breathe is considered Public, why not that which passes through it?

In this talk Julian will discuss the Commons in the context of a City's unseen telecommunications infrastructure. Interventions by artists and critical engineers will be introduced that explore the techno-political complexities of wireless communication, revealing a need to rethink our traditional delimitations of Public and Private.

       yourself speak so it's literally like                               being in a bit of a vacuum but um                               nonetheless I'm going to try and make                               this this work I'm Julian Oliver I'm                               from New Zealand I'm living here in                               Berlin this talk will be in English                                unless of course you'd like to hear a                                three-year-old speaking German about the                                public space private space to Commons                                and wireless technology so in the event                                you probably don't want to hear a                                three-year-old speak on those topics I                                will speak in English                                my talk was initially given this sort of                                rather posh title I mean it's got the                                classic sort of academic you know : in                                the middle where you make a statement                                but then you you rephrase a little Rhian                                body it in some way so it used to be                                this Urbanek exploits rethinking the                                Commons in an age of wireless                                communication and Judah were very                                fortuitous mess up with with with Verena                                one of the organizers the first line of                                my talk description was actually taken                                as the title which is if the air we                                breathe is considered public then why                                not that which passes through it and I                                think this this is actually in many ways                                a better frame for the talk but I've got                                to be talking about about about this in                                the context of the electromagnetic                                spectrum of spectra of of                                telecommunications infrastructure and                                wireless communications technologies                                when I'm talking about the Commons the                                Commons I'm obviously talking about a                                very very complex thing that comprises                                both public and will includes both                                public and private elements and it is                                quite awkward to to neatly summarized                                the Commons                                you know historically one can never                                speak about it as a singular thing the                                Commons has evolved immensely over the                                over the years even now we struggle a                                lot to define the Commons especially as                                even though the Commons include both a                                material domain and a and a cultural                                domain what what includes culture has                                has been radically reshaped if you like                                by the advent of digital computing and                                and computer networking so yeah it's got                                cultural and material domains but just                                to start talking about the cultural                                domain I mean one for instance can can                                consider language in all the world's                                languages as themselves being very much                                a part of this thing that we refer to as                                the Commons we all have a right of                                access to learn a language to study a                                language to even speak a language there                                are no languages at least that I'm aware                                of that that one isn't actually allowed                                to freely engage and study and learn and                                redistribute and even possibly                                contribute to in fact it's it's a very                                early form of source code like a think                                of language by very virtue of the fact                                that it that it evolves through use in                                even productively through misuse I mean                                Shakespeare is said to have invented                                some                                                                 words like strange and weird and beard                                head and advertising we're all invented                                by Shakespeare so language is something                                that we have right access to as much as                                read access but we can we you know                                borrowing from a sort of computer                                computer science terminology we have the                                rights to to read that code and also                                right back into it Wikipedia is of                                course very much a part of now what we                                would understand to be the cultural                                Commons and it's a significant                                contribution to if you like the the the                                the Commons and not just the as an                                archive of common knowledge but                                knowledge that can be written to and it                                is there's undoubtedly a massive is ask                                for a massive if reinvestigation rethink                                of of the of the cultural Commons in                                that regard I mean public libraries have                                often fulfilled a role as                                as a as a guarded body of knowledge that                                that sort of needed it's it's it's it's                                 right of access but but to be able to of                                 course I mean it's very fashionable                                 democratize the the authoring process is                                 undoubtedly significant the Linux kernel                                 is another good example of of the                                 Commons in a cultural domain that starts                                 to get a bit tricky because again we see                                 a very early example of of the Commons                                 sort of creeping over into the technical                                 sphere this is something that that is                                 maybe not quite as clearly delimited in                                 historically as it is presently now                                 where we have a common code base one                                 which is so of such vast importance to                                 to infrastructure to the running of                                 power stations to you know that the                                 Future Combat Systems to to you know                                 what your router runs to the domain of                                 smartphones and even my laptop but yeah                                 this is also similarly a cultural common                                 object if you like if we can possibly                                 call it that television in the context                                 of broadcasting is also considered to be                                 part of the cultural Commons so we have                                 this interesting interesting phenomenon                                 phenomenon of of of television towers                                 broadcasting content that we all have a                                 right to read we don't have a right to                                 author but we have a right to read and                                 that's um that's something that that                                 even with the advent of people having to                                 pay a broadcasting fee or being asked to                                 pay a broadcasting fee even though that                                 that that broadcast itself is privately                                 owned it's it's publicly shared at least                                 it's publicly accessible so again that                                 one can't talk about the Commons as just                                 merely the the private sphere and the                                 public sphere as we start getting into                                 spectra and the electromagnetic domain                                 things get really quite weird almost as                                 weird as this man vogner Magnus works                                 out for instance also seem to be and I                                 mean this man's got such an amazing                                 faces you can really see like like                                 Valkyries riding out of his face I mean                                 there's the this man's face looks like                                 his music is incredible                                 but um if magma is a really good example                                 of of someone whose work is considered                                 to be now a sort of a public treasure                                 it's a gift that's a publicly owned                                 cultural object or set of objects in                                 fact anything after                                                 January the                                     like for instance Virginia Wolf's                                 writings and it's or anything previous                                 to January                                                              similarly in the public domain it's in                                 its in the cultural Commons now where                                 are the widows of stuff end up it ends                                 up traditionally in book form as we saw                                 before with televisions or manuscripts                                 as far as vagueness concerned orchestral                                 works that might have a public outcome                                 but it's increasingly in the up on on                                 hard disks of course and Wikipedia is                                 naturally I'm a good example of hard to                                 have hard s to hard disk in to end                                 distribution of this of this cultural                                 common material but moving into the                                 material domain therefore we will                                 probably be most familiar with the                                 Commons in the context of something like                                 a park this is the beautiful park behind                                 my my studio and home actually and this                                 is housing Heide Park here and now here                                 in Berlin and it's just it's a really                                 computable park I love this park and and                                 I love it and I celebrate and I really                                 do I must say like the way that that                                 that Berlin is actually celebrate this                                 as a Commons I mean even the way that                                 they sort of distribute themselves with                                 these sort of equidistant metric or                                 something like this the self sorting                                 algorithm of like I'm not going to piss                                 you off and you're not going to piss me                                 off we're just going to keep our dogs                                 not looking each other's mouths or asses                                 you know it's certain distances I love                                 hanging out in this park a park is a                                 place whereby we are we are allowed to                                 to enjoy and share the enjoyment of that                                 Park but similarly we're not allowed to                                 chop a tree down for instance we're not                                 allowed to to start a huge fire when                                 allowed to even dig a hole we're not                                 allowed to do these things in in this                                 common in this common space                                 and that already represents quite a                                 shift from the very early origins of the                                 Commons as it was as it was found if we                                 found that if you like in European                                 history whereby one was a commoner one                                 had access or right of access to common                                 land you could you could chop down a                                 tree you could use the land you could                                 even you know milk your goats on that                                 land and graze them or whatever one                                 thing however that does stick with any                                 definition of the Commons is that the                                 Commons cannot be commodified or s                                 otherwise it wouldn't be the Commons it                                 would be entirely privatized and of                                 course when we when we start looking at                                 that in public space things also get a                                 bit weird we've got this phenomenon of                                 advertising creeping up onto the onto                                 the surfaces of their Commons but not                                 actually in the Commons themselves so                                 much but with with advertising in                                 smartphones things do start to get get a                                 bit more complex there this is                                 Piccadilly Circus and in the UK in                                 London and and now the the value of this                                 Commons has actually become I guess it's                                 it's inflated furthermore by virtue of                                 the fact that the advertising has become                                 a spectacle so people are actually                                 literally going to this place to enjoy                                 the to bask and the neon light of this                                 as a kind of a yeah as an animated                                 surface                                 [Music]                                 but then we have we have these weird                                 places like the arcades that that water                                 Benjamin wrote a lot about these are                                 differently public spaces one is in them                                 in a public sense but because they have                                 this little enclosure over the top of                                 sorts                                 they almost represent the fact that they                                 are in fact semi privatized you can't                                 for instance and in the arcades of Paris                                 pick up your violin and start playing                                 you can't for instance hand out flyers                                 with with with without certain paperwork                                 you know taken care of                                 these are regulated spaces they're sort                                 of semi common or hybrid spaces I would                                 argue that in fact the the arcades and                                 what we often refer to as open open                                 shopping malls are in fact a better                                 metaphor for understanding how the                                 Internet is also a kind of a semi                                 privatized hybrid hybrid Commons another                                 good example of a of something that is                                 that has the outward appearances of a                                 Commons but but it's absolutely the                                 opposite just to again constructively or                                 productively complexify this thing that                                 we call the Commons is the the the foyer                                 of a hotel you know you might have                                 people from many many different cultures                                 hanging out doing all the kinds of                                 things one would assume that they could                                 possibly do even in a in a very overly                                 well mannered maybe town square but it                                 is absolutely a private a private domain                                 increasingly cities are taking a taking                                 on these projects this is I think it's                                 in Suzu and in China we have this huge                                 outdoor shopping malls surrounded by                                 just this incrustation of of commission                                 flats of residential you know projects                                 and and so the the idea is you literally                                 put this you know UFO in the middle of                                 all of it and and you wrap it up you put                                 parks in it but you ensure that the                                 entire experience is guarded and                                 controlled steered regulated and                                 maintained in fact it's just just                                 because it doesn't                                 even that doesn't have a roof on it does                                 not mean at all and is not an entirely                                 privately governed place there's a                                 project that kicked off in                                             the appetizer which wrote about three                                 and a half thousand lines of C code to                                 get this thing off the ground just so it                                 could run on these binoculars starts                                 that when you're walking around the                                 streets with these these retro                                 futuristic looking binoculars you see                                 you see artwork instead of advertising                                 say literally replacing on the fly in                                 real time advertising with with artwork                                 made by the people in that area and and                                 this is a project that's been shown at                                 all all around the world now but we                                 found that that even going into certain                                 open-air shopping malls around the world                                 and using this this this work of                                 augmented reality I call an improved                                 reality we get policemen or members of                                 the public coming up and telling us that                                 we can't manipulate our own cognition we                                 can't we can't actually look at the                                 advertisements and see art instead                                 because that would be denying the                                 advertisers their right to manipulate                                 our experience of public place so I mean                                 that's getting a bit away from the the                                 topic at hand but but just just again                                 talk about the how the how the networked                                 and digital domain is deeply complexify                                 another standing for public private in                                 the comments no this will this open a                                 shopping mall here in China it hasn't                                 been built yet if it has been built and                                 it looks like that then the world really                                 is becoming a                                                      itself I mean the air itself is is that                                 is that privatized I mean we understand                                 the air to be almost the very wrote                                 atomic Platonic even the nominative                                 thing of all in a substrate of this                                 thing we call the Commons that the air                                 we breathe is undoubtedly and and under                                 Ghosh oblique instead of public but the                                 the air itself was already a site for a                                 tremendous number of different                                 competitive forces and influences                                 overlapping the public and the private                                 again if I'm back in that Park and I'm                                 breathing that air I can even be by                                 myself on that park bench and breathing                                 it but the air is being used the air is                                 being used for instance for insect and                                 animal communications this this moth                                 here this male moth can actually smell                                 and using an electrochemical process                                 female moth pheromones about three                                 kilometres away so it is that the                                 antenna on this moth actually are a part                                 of it of a very sophisticated long-range                                 communication service structure within                                 this within the species we are hearing                                 and what we are not hearing bird call                                 and insect call all the time but                                 nonetheless we're very much submerged in                                 a substrate which is being used for                                 wireless communication looking at it                                 from the perspective of spectra we see                                 for instance the FM and an AM in                                 microwave I'll be talking a lot about                                 microwave is more within the realm of                                 what would understand to be modern human                                 implementations of of communications                                 infrastructure long radio waves there in                                 the yeah and the you know the the very                                 very low frequencies are typically used                                 for like naval and police etc etcetera                                 army stuff so what can I hear when I'm                                 actually in that part myself I mean I                                 can hear birds and six and dogs and I                                 can hear those incessant infernal                                 hippies trying to play African drums all                                 the time I can't hear them unfortunately                                 but but these these these things are                                 within a very very narrow window of of                                 experience I mean air pressure as being                                 you it changes in air pressures what my                                 eardrum is registering when I'm hearing                                 those on those hippies singing on                                 namasivaya or whatever the name of their                                 moon goddesses but um but nonetheless                                 you know radio and and Woollett                                 as as a as a human with a pair of ears I                                 am I'm a broadcast receiver I'm                                 receiving broadcasts right it doesn't                                 matter for instance if someone is as                                 whispering to the person next to them or                                 they are shouting from the other end of                                 the park                                 I'm omen amariah which this hippie was                                 shouting other day yeah happy sorry I'll                                 stop gonna have it heavy but yeah the it                                 doesn't matter that once it has left the                                 mouth once it has left the the                                 instruments or whatever it is it is in                                 the air from the perspective of my                                 eardrum it is merely a broadcast                                 receiver on the on the on the very                                 physical level it is not making a                                 distinction between should I have heard                                 that or not and I will be I'll be                                 talking a lot about about them oh yeah                                 that wiretapping and eavesdropping in in                                 a second I could augment my experience                                 in that Park by actually pulling out a                                 radio I could pull out a radio and set                                 it on the grass and I could listen to                                 the news sports results I could tune                                 into a you know musical program or                                 something like that I'm extending one                                 could more fashionably say augmenting my                                 my experience and at the moment I'm                                 doing that I am I'm already stepping                                 outside of other realm of what as you                                 know overtly apparent to my foot to my                                 organic infrastructure and I'm extending                                 it into the technical domain what's                                 interesting about about radios from the                                 perspective of broadcasters again                                 they're generally privately owned                                 corporations that have paid for the                                 right to broadcast within a particular                                 range of spectra in a particular region                                 so it can be a private enterprise that                                 has a public broadcast outcome                                 I can't however also take something like                                 like a smartphone out of my pocket and                                 further augment into into other domains                                 I can move into the ADA                                              communication specification space which                                 is effectively microwave                                                gigahertz when I'm working with                                     gigahertz                                                              effectively in the same range that your                                 microwave oven is at home as a test for                                 instance you can try and connect to the                                 internet while you're cooking a pumpkin                                 and your microwave while using your                                 wireless network at home that the                                 microwave will be absolutely dominating                                 that that that part of the of the of the                                 of the spectra your phone is capable of                                 doing that if you're using one of these                                 intelligent phones but GSM and Europe is                                 typically it's typically                                             megahertz                                 it's                                                                    that's that's a further further                                 extension but what i'm doing work with                                 them but with these two different things                                 is is quite different with the ada                                     wireless networking functionality on my                                 phone i'm doing something very similar                                 to what radio is doing already I am I'm                                 in a I'm in a kind of a near field                                 broadcast potential as a receiver                                 I can't hear wireless packets in from                                 someone's router five kilometers away                                 generally I've only got line-of-sight at                                 best of a couple of hundred meters but                                 for GSM I'm joining a much broader                                 network that that the cellular network                                 that it will immediately extend                                 immediately extend and just one hop the                                 reach of my phone to to a vast variety                                 of other of other                                 about the communication spaces of course                                 with with a gateway on that wireless                                 network I can reach the internet as well                                 but nonetheless typically people are                                 used to just seeing this they rip they                                 realize that this actually relates to                                 their phone but the idea of a with zone                                 is very much like a kind of a radio Zone                                 in fact technically speaking the the                                 wireless device on an on a on a                                 smartphone or in a laptop or a tablet                                 computer is technically it's a it's a                                 radio device it's a ADA to a live and                                 specification is a radio specification                                 this is on a on an iPhone                                           where the vs. where the the wireless                                 nickers and in the purple part that's                                 actually where the chip is on an iPhone                                                                                                          communications right through to to talk                                 to radio and television and then into                                 the wireless domain as I say                                     gigahertz typically as what we use when                                 we're using wireless networks and the                                 GSM the world has very much become a                                 cable I mean right now in this room                                 estimate right now there's room P and                                 G's gifs jpegs emails HTML fragments are                                 passing through our very body at at this                                 at this very moment we are we're a part                                 of the cable we're a part of the                                 transmission material I'm just going to                                 pop out of here and just show you very                                 quickly                                 just how much one can actually see                                 this is for instance just a quick basic                                 packet dump of what's what's happening                                 in this environment a tremendous amount                                 of traffic anything that looks garbled                                 will probably be encrypted or gzip                                 compressed or it will just be binary                                 binary button binary data blobs but                                 right now you have on the left you have                                 you have a formatted hex hex dump and on                                 the right you have you have ascii output                                 I can take that hex directly and turn it                                 straight back into into the into the                                 actual data itself as intended I'm going                                 to show you a little project I did that                                 that does that in a second but that's                                 passing through us right now                                 our bodies are no barrier for for this                                 for the movement of the stuff our bodies                                 are not very aware part of the cable and                                 there's a little project I did just as                                 that this is a sketch for a little                                 exhibition we had in our studio and                                 vices                                                                wanted to I wanted to create a bridge if                                 you like between the domain of                                 television and and wireless as as a as a                                 public broadcast in other words when                                 people are using your phones for                                 wireless network and your laptops and                                 wireless and networking and stuff you                                 you are when you're sending an email                                 you're practically sending it in                                 broadcast and I wanted to kind of                                 communicate that we don't have an                                 intimate relationship with with the BBC                                 we don't have an intimate relationship                                 with with with even a friend on the                                 other side of the world to which you are                                 sending an email there are many many                                 computers involved along the way we'll                                 talk a bit about that but that anyone                                 else in that immediate environment can                                 tune in their radio and listen to to                                 what you're doing and and I'm a big fan                                 of beautiful old televisions and I grew                                 up in New Zealand and in a very rural                                 place so we're a sort of a bit behind                                 with the TVs we had really old TVs and                                 I've got you know but a sentimental                                 attachment to old TVs and it's very sad                                 here in Germany to see these beautiful                                 old old old machines these devices these                                 broadcast receivers sitting in                                 in in second-hand markets flow marks and                                 stuff like that with no one to broadcast                                 to them because the whole analog                                 television thing is is over it's done                                 unless you are digitally capable as a                                 television you you have no one to talk                                 to effectively so what I wanted to do                                 was to taken the analog TV format and                                 and and and and and give it give it a                                 new broadcast station what I've done is                                 I've made it such that every wireless                                 device in its environment becomes its                                 television tower                                 [Music]                                 need some audio though does need some                                 sound                                 as the where's the Mexico I see rounds                                 [Music]                                 yeah for sounds                                 yeah it's just a very very simple little                                 sketch and it's relatively bad                                 documentation having the chance to                                 document it properly but I'm doing a                                 whole range of these I'm doing about                                    old TVs each of which have a tiny little                                 parasite computer in them with a little                                 wireless network interface that is                                 listening in monitor mode it can hear                                 any anything in the ear that is not                                 effectively encrypted and of course I                                 can actually join an encrypted Network                                 and hear all that too but the idea is to                                 just again to give these beautiful old                                 analog televisions a TV tower again and                                 the absence of them so back over to here                                 on that notes                                 so um yeah we have already this idea                                 we've uncovered what we've covered of                                 the of the Commons as being a complex                                 mix of the of the public and and the                                 private but in in the domain of air of                                 air itself this thing that we understand                                 to be absolutely public it's already                                 totally infused with with with with                                 private public contradictions it's an                                 air is a very good example of the public                                 in the private and the private in the                                 public so how do how do wireless                                 networks into plate with the commons a                                 classic example is this sort of this you                                 know I guess kind of mobile office and                                 home you know mobile office Mecca                                 Sanko berholtz where I think anyone now                                 that comes into Berlin with the with the                                 with a recent Mac has to go there first                                 one of us is one of us man exactly no                                 I'm and it's it's it's a messy place                                 when I was first diagnosed I could not                                 believe just just the the the the sheer                                 density of computer users and their this                                 seamless blend of coffee focaccia and                                 and and Facebook and Facebook should                                 just buy it                                 Logan's not mrs. lovely place really low                                 place and the owners really nice and                                 he's been really good good to us and                                 we've been in there we've been playing                                 around that's quite remarkable you'll be                                 you'll be doing some you know you'll be                                 synthesizing audio or impact streams or                                 images just playing around on a on an                                 open network in a cafe now importantly                                 it's an open network but is that network                                 really public I mean I I don't have to                                 necessarily go inside there and sit down                                 buy a coffee to use it in fact I've even                                 gone to some global holes sat down and                                 and and and not bought a coffee and used                                 it but what if I'm using that network or                                 even misusing that network from outside                                 the the very territory that's delimited                                 by the physical constraints of song                                 clover Holtz what happens if I'm outside                                 in a white van you know using this using                                 the service now when I'm inside I'm very                                 much sort of inside the domain of what                                 is understood to be a private space but                                 I'm using a network which which is given                                 as a as a as a as a service but it's not                                 strictly a public service if I'm if I'm                                 reconstructing people's webpages as they                                 are browsing or something like that or                                 I'm looking at the images that they are                                 that they are you know downloading or                                 uploading or whatever when I'm on this                                 network am I am i eavesdropping or am i                                 listening this is a very interesting                                 question given the fact that again all                                 I'm doing is putting my card into                                 maximal hearing mode that's what a                                 monitor mode is in the in the in the                                 information security space when we're                                 talking about wireless networking and                                 and packet capture I'm really opening my                                 ears it's the equivalent of me lying                                 down in the park and closing my eyes and                                 trying to hear everything that everyone                                 is saying but that puts me in a very                                 very difficult sort of legal territory                                 immediately even though on a technical                                 level                                 I'm only fully using the technology                                 that's been given to me but in a in the                                 sense of the Commons I'm stepping on                                 several toes we like to think of                                 encryption as a kind of a boundary wall                                 we think of we think of um you know                                 these keys like WPA keys that we were                                 used to seeing when we're setting up a                                 wireless router at home or or when were                                 typing in you know passwords and bits                                 and pieces WEP keys pretty easy to break                                 in and in just a few minutes really but                                 but the browser log on or paper use we                                 also think it offers a kind of a wall                                 but this is something that is very very                                 easily in many many cases gotten around                                 but but the encryption itself becomes it                                 becomes a kind of a physical wall of                                 sorts or at least that's imagined that                                 way as though it was made of brick and                                 concrete and said no dammit you know                                 this is this is where this is where our                                 our enterprise ends you know it stops                                 here you can't get inside this building                                 and you can't get inside this network                                 but what if I'm to for instance go into                                 a into a cafe that does have an                                 encrypted network and I buy a cup of                                 coffee for a couple of bucks I get the                                 key I drink my coffee                                 I am I terrorized people on Facebook I                                 don't have a Facebook account actually                                 but I know I'm just generally nasty and                                 horrible and and then think you know go                                 away and then come back the next day and                                 sit outside or over the road or at my                                 friend's apartment upstairs and continue                                 to use that network you know have hikes                                 if I extended if I give that key out to                                 friends as well if I extended those                                 comments where am I in the sense of the                                 public and the private needs                                 delimitations once I have the key to                                 wireless never am I am i part of a group                                 as well                                 if I if I do get the kid you know join                                 that group are we having a conversation                                 together are we all we all hanging out I                                 mean is it is it a party what if I                                 return to use a network but sit in the                                 car over the street yeah who space am i                                 in this brings up the the volatility of                                 data data itself becomes becomes a                                 territory as valued and been preserved                                 and cherished and and governed and                                 guarded as for instance the the the                                 treason has in Heide Park                                 I can't walk up and cut a branch off a                                 tree or chop a tree down or bring my                                 goats in to graze or set up a fence or                                 dig a hole I can't do those things that                                 I'm part of a commons but I'm I have                                 certain rights and responsibilities data                                 itself becomes this very flammable thing                                 it's a project i I made for an                                 exhibition at the in la blah blah blah                                 Boland and hasta cultura and de velde as                                 part of our studio exhibition we had                                    pieces in the show and it's called the                                 transparency grenade and Suzanne stout                                 who I would hope she was here but I                                 don't think she could make it on time                                 she did all the silver work on that up                                 well quite tell about it but in the                                 moment but it takes the form of a Soviet                                 f                                                                        and successful weapon used in many wars                                 but instead of having explosives on the                                 inside it has a small R M based computer                                 running a very stripped-down a new Linux                                 distribution I've spent quite a bit of                                 time you know stripping it down it's got                                 a it's got a broadband wireless antenna                                 it's got a Nintendo DS battery and it's                                 got a microphone when you pull the pin                                 on the grenade it captures all of the                                 wireless traffic in your environment and                                 anything that the the microphone can                                 hear and tunnels it to my server where                                 it is mined for JPEGs gifs PNG z mail                                 fragments and HTML fragments and then                                 put on a map at that actual location of                                 the detonation so for instance of you if                                 if you're walkin if you know if your                                 trusted member of an organization or                                 something like that you know security                                 guard waving you in and walk into the                                 into the meeting pull the pin and make                                 what is otherwise the closed meeting                                 absolutely public it's a direct pipe                                 from the private to the public domain                                 it's like into the leak or something                                 like that so you could be a disgruntled                                 civil servant                                 you could be a you could be a you know                                 if someone works at a corporation that's                                 just really sick of the the lies or the                                  and you would like to you would                                 like to - both organizationally suicide                                 and and and you know go out with a                                 proverbial bang it's it's a handheld                                 iconic solution to the problem of a lack                                 of transparency in corporate and                                 governmental domain here's some drawings                                 of it                                 before the printing Susanne stark she's                                 an amazing goldsmith she did the all the                                 metalwork                                 here's my electronics to do in advisers                                 classes even it's me working on it it's                                 got a it's got a risen printed resin                                 body with this lovely silver caps                                 there's all the bits laid out it's the                                 broadband but the very it's a it's it's                                 a B a B G in a BG antenna it's very good                                 in tenor and yeah it's got a bit of a                                 reset of CSI like map I suppose fish and                                 the classic CSI we have a dilemma                                 San Francisco and India you can even                                 browse in real time the the images that                                 have that are being being viewed on that                                 network so for instance if someone is if                                 someone is using an iPhone or that                                 network they would probably have a                                 username that would be the host name of                                 the device would be the name of the user                                 so quite often you see it'll be                                 something like Cara's iPhone or John's                                 iPad or Dan's Android Dan's                                 s                                                                      you see the IP and you see what they are                                 doing at that point when they're                                 browsing and there's many different                                 yeah naturally it's entirely illegal to                                 provide this as a service but I am                                 developing an Android application at the                                 moment that I'll be distributing maybe                                 at the end because I'm gonna run out of                                 time it's at an Exhibition at the moment                                 I would love to but the thing is I can't                                 actually legally do it I wanted to build                                 this this device as a means of also                                 pointing out some of the some of the                                 difficulties really it's an object that                                 I can't even legally use I can't even                                 provide the service you know without                                 without being kicked kicked back with a                                 very sore ass all the way back to New                                 Zealand's you know I can't actually                                 physically use the thing but I can build                                 it I can implement it and I can prove it                                 works and then I can I can allow it to                                 open up some theory but I think to be                                 important conversations the Android                                 application I will be distributing                                 freely including the source code and the                                 server-side code I will be distributing                                 freely and you can set it up yourself                                 but I can't provide the service thing is                                 is that we can't can't say that we know                                 what's in our pocket little on what they                                 really do these these phones these                                 smartphones for instance are lying about                                 us all the time we're telling stories or                                 you know you know dialing home I mean                                 that they're really quite um you know                                 promiscuous to use another network you                                 know another word network terminology                                 they really have very promiscuous                                 devices the yeah quite troubling that                                 the main thing is from it from a techno                                 political and cultural perspective                                 things have really become much harder                                 for us in order to have a real sense of                                 subjectivity as to these risks a good                                 example for instance of it as the music                                 player of the turn of the turn of the                                                                                                      have that the gramophone the gramophone                                 I would describe it as a self describing                                 objects you know it is somewhat it                                 practically opened by design one can                                 even look at it and see where the sound                                 comes out you can see where the energy                                 input is                                 you know kinetic energy and when you                                 turn the crank the wheel turns if you                                 look closely enough at the record you                                 can actually see the little tiny grooves                                 on the record and the needle sitting on                                 those grooves and so it's the whole                                 process from energy inputs to to sound                                 out as described in this object but                                 compare it to the iPod Nano for instance                                 it's just a field of surfaces metaphors                                 it's an iconographic an interface to                                 what's inside and few people you know                                 even few people I know could could                                 actually tell you how this works and                                 what those parts do you know it's an                                 opaque closed ungenerous non self                                 describing our object and so it's very                                 difficult for us to find entry points                                 into understanding where at where the                                 thresholds of public and private where                                 our rights are and and and even what the                                 objects that we depend upon you know                                 that the risks that they are that they                                 introduce even the right to open those                                 things is increasingly contested you                                 know we we are actually stepping over at                                 a legal threshold as the previous                                 speaker introduced we're stepping over a                                 legal threshold when we open up a device                                 that we supposedly own a following on                                 from what he said but I would say that                                 if one kind of one is disallowed the                                 right or a warranty is breached or you                                 you know the right of repair or even the                                 right of ownership is contested by                                 modifying a device that you own or I                                 bring it up for for inspection or for                                 study you don't own that device actually                                 you're effectively leasing it so there                                 are many walls between us and becoming                                 better at understanding that the you                                 know our subjectivity in this highly                                 engineered domain there's a very nice                                 project by some some some guys one of                                 them one of which is a friend of mine I                                 drew him and it's called loca set to                                 discoverable which really explore some                                 of this stuff they built a bunch of                                 concrete blocks and put inside them a                                 little phone that's that's that's a                                 got it spur bluetooth-enabled there's                                 some code little scripts and bits and                                 pieces when people are walking past                                 these these objects probably not even                                 noticing their existence these objects                                 are ascending those phones messages                                 those phones are receiving little                                 messages and France is one of the                                 messages as you know you were in a                                 flower shop and spent                                                   park I are you in love you know this is                                 this is this is data that was gathered                                 by the system they had they had a one of                                 these little modules outside a flower                                 shop and then a couple in a park and by                                 merely by merely reading the the                                 fingerprints if you like on a device                                 level from those from those devices in                                 people's pockets as they were roaming                                 about they were able to produce quite                                 simply a construction like this a                                 probability                                 but the the cellular communications                                 space the telecommunication space                                 they're all really well into this one of                                 them one of one of my projects for this                                 year has been documenting the phenomenon                                 of stealth cell towers you know which is                                 incredible it's an incredible thing                                 telecommunications companies don't want                                 us to know that there are cell towers in                                 our environment and they do they go to                                 extreme if it's three creative efforts                                 to ensure that we don't know that                                 they're happening and they they build                                 these things that are actually not trees                                 they're not treated or they're not                                 living that they're nylon and wire that                                 look enough like trees and people to                                 just a little bit like like I'm like                                 that to walk past them in public space                                 and not feel contested by them what I                                 mean contested or threatened I mean that                                 with all the fear of cellular                                 communications and cellular disruption                                 and the bodies you know putting cell                                 towers next to schools is generally not                                 considered to be a good idea people                                 don't want to feel like that the                                 technology is so much in their                                 environment that that it might that it                                 might take some of the charm out of                                 cement your lovely antiquated heritage                                 protected streets so there's all sorts                                 of reasons some of them get really great                                 like cell tower disguised as a street                                 lamp                                 apparently the street lamp doesn't                                 actually turn on and it's never worked                                 it's the only street lamp and about                                     meters just sitting there by itself they                                 you know that they could have gone that

disguised as                                 bricks which I really like like someone                                 has someone's actually sat down and                                 thought about that they've gone up there                                 maybe on a ladder with a camera and                                 photograph to the bricks and then gone                                 down to local print shop and then had                                 them stuck onto the two cell towers                                 yet just as any definition of the

                     mine that I did this year as a                                 commission for a Liverpool based                                 festival called abandoned normal devices                                 they're really amazing if you ever have                                 a chance to work with him you should and                                 border pumping is kind of a complex                                 project but I'm going to talk about one                                 one aspect of it really really quickly                                 and it's it's again it's looking at the                                 kinds of ontology and belief structures                                 and investments and dependencies that we                                 build into these you know these these                                 things these guys we really trust them a                                 lot we place a tremendous amount of                                 trust I want to explore that trust and I                                 want to take as a kind of dystopic                                  proposition what if telecommunications                                  companies were themselves territories                                  what if they were countries to a certain                                  degree what if I could somehow find a                                  way of pitching Nate nationhood national                                  borders with telecommunications                                  companies to sort of put them at war a                                  little bit I was flying into Istanbul                                  for ICEA and as the plane was tipping                                  like this and you could see the water                                  and you could see the city it was a                                  really wonderful moment and it was quite                                  a meditative moment actually I was that                                  looking at the water and looking at the                                  looking at the city I hadn't been to                                  Istanbul before I was really excited and                                  and I was shocked out of my um out of my                                  little trance by the sound the very                                  cacophonous dissonant sounds of every                                  phone on the plane getting an SMS from                                  the telecommunications company saying                                  you know welcome welcome home you know                                  and and I said to myself well this is                                  where the border should be drawn you                                  know the border of Turkey should be                                  pulled out into the water and drawn them                                  and this is what I did I made a an                                  Android application that that you you                                  start up before you cross the border and                                  it logs your position in the moment that                                  that used to switch MCC the moment you                                  switch from from one cell tower to                                  another but you're you're legally within                                  the national territory that you're                                  standing in like you know I might be in                                  the north of you know north of Spain                                  now say I'm at Barcelona I'm near France                                  right I'm in Barcelona and if I go up                                  into the Pyrenees there's certain points                                  I can go up there where where I can be                                  physically standing in Spain but my                                  phone will switch over to to France you                                  know welcome to you know of you know                                  orange or orange if I you know something                                  like this you know and this this book                                  this will really happen and these are                                  very interesting moments these are                                  moments that are being actively used by                                  gun traffickers drug dealers people                                  interest in all sorts of contraband                                  because their devices in one location                                  but their bodies in another it puts them                                  in a very interesting field of potential                                  till Nagaland and Christopher peach I                                  worked with the developer a mapping                                  application such that all of the the the                                  SMS is from these phones when there is                                  this Board of disparity event a sense so                                  that to the server where they're rented                                  on a map but I'll just quickly show you                                  what that looks like on the map now                                  before running out of time in my talk                                  which I am going to yeah looks like this                                  [Music]                                  so these are there's a real ton of these                                  are real imports that are coming from                                  real people that are running my app on                                  their phones as they're crossing borders                                  around around Europe the borders are                                  being redrawn based on their proximity                                  to the border and the discrepancy                                  between their network context and their                                  physical context                                  you can go to border but pink nitin and                                  download the app and then run it when                                  you're next crossing a border it's not                                  so good naturally we could just fly into                                  an airport that would pull the border                                  right into the middle of a country or                                  something like that as it doesn't work                                  but but if you if you're walking across                                  the border where someone else happens or                                  you're driving or in a trainer and a bus                                  it's that's perfect so that's that                                  quickly stop that and back to the thing                                  yeah trust and engineering                                  infrastructure is what we're trusting                                  and when were trusting in women we're                                  placing our maximal trust and                                  engineering there could be no better                                  example for instance then the aerospace                                  infrastructure you know when you when                                  the plane is lifting off you are yo you                                  are giving yourself to a to a tremendous                                  complexity of of engineered                                  infrastructure from telecommunications                                  of air traffic control right through to                                  turbine engines engineer infrastructure                                  is very much a part of our environment                                  you know so it follows that that that -                                  not this is a critical engineering                                  principle to not have the basic                                  vocabulary to be able to describe your                                  environment on the terms in which it's                                  given its engineered its engineered                                  Innis its technics                                  as to put you in a critically vulnerable                                  position it's to be in a critically                                  vulnerable position one doesn't have to                                  be an engineer to be able to have a                                  basic understanding as to how the                                  internet works for instance you can ask                                  almost anyone you know how the postcard                                  you you sent them arrived in their                                  mailbox and they'll be able to give you                                  a relatively coherent description of how                                  that postcard actually got there but if                                  you ask them to describe how the email                                  you sent them arrived in the inbox you'd                                  be better writing it down and putting it                                  into a poetry journal it'll be a little                                  bit like a work of high surrealism it's                                  very difficult for people to grasp the                                  abstraction of modern computer                                  networking and it's understandable but                                  there's a lot of effort to ensure that                                  we we can't have easy access to this                                  stuff                                  unattended emissions so as I was talking                                  before about smart phones every um every                                  wirelessly enabled device using you know                                  wireless networking technology has a has                                  a hardware signature it's either known                                  as an M AC address or MAC address as                                  long as it with Apple or a hardware                                  address this is a hardware address of                                  one of my networking by wireless network                                  devices there's a brilliant project that                                  I'm extremely jealous of makes it much                                  worse because they're both my friends                                  but I think it's the best project and in                                  the best work of critical engineering                                  and and you know all                                                     same exhibition and the house the                                  cultured and developed and it's called                                  Packard Brooker it's just a beautiful                                  project basically the you know when                                  you're using location services on your                                  phone and it says you know would you                                  like to refine your position you know                                  using GPS or you can refine your                                  location down to down to a matter of                                  meters or something like that what                                  you're doing is is your is your your                                  your setting your phone into into a into                                  a mode whereby it as resourcing a huge                                  database of access point locations                                  access point wireless access points like                                  the one in your home or the one in                                  Sancto berholtz that we looked at before                                  these themselves are part of a massive                                  database and and beacon beacon                                  triangulation beacon frame triangulation                                  is used to locate you so what what                                  packet Brook it did was to build a                                  device like this that has it has                                  effectively a router for every single                                  channel in the wireless spectrum and put                                  it in our studio and visors devices even                                  and put another one down in the hosta                                  culture and develop those those special                                  frames called beacon frames that that it                                  constantly as we saw before much of that                                  traffic before was beacon frames from                                  wireless networks was captured in Noyd                                  cone in our studio that contains the

                            to call turn to that where they where                                  they're lit out again the result of that                                  is people in the house tackled                                  developed during the exhibition we're                                  picking up their phones and we're going                                  looking for looking for a local bar or a                                  local cafe or a restaurant to get                                  something to eat and they were being                                  told that they were in Noyd there                                  are actually people walking out of of                                  the house our continent develop into the                                  darkness you know saying it's over here                                  it's over here you know it was it was it                                  was really quite amazing again this this                                  this implicit trust we place an                                  infrastructure that that this is telling                                  me that this is you know this is middle                                  Manning it's like a middle man in the                                  middle attack it's it's middle Manning                                  my relationship with the world I'm being                                  proxied through a through an                                  infrastructure I might not necessarily                                  have control of can't computer networks                                  be an extension of the Commons this is a                                  really big question but before we we go                                  into it we'd have to actually before you                                  go on anymore because we're running                                  behind how much time have I got actually                                  in all seriousness                                  it's technically yeah but two minutes                                  but that means only got three-quarters                                  of an hour and I planned an hour talk                                  three                                  okay I have to skip through a whole                                  bunch of stuff then that's cool so says                                  open your eyes don't don't blink and let                                  that let the images just to pervade deep                                  penetrate deeply into the back of your                                  brain like this is a detective epic look                                  at the victim                                  I can just go to here then I'm gonna                                  show you a movie which doesn't count as                                  minutes because it's a movie and it's                                  more entertaining with it basically you                                  hear this a lot right the access to the                                  Internet is a fundamental human right                                  and I'm often in these panels or in                                  human where you've got humanities folk                                  often very very bright that because they                                  don't have a rudimentary understanding                                  of what the Internet is or what a                                  computer network is really then they                                  couldn't describe how an email is                                  actually sent they they they find                                  themselves in a place whereby they're                                  describing something as a Commons                                  whereby it doesn't actually otherwise                                  exist the internet doesn't belong to the                                  people however does belong to those that                                  own the cables and this is very much the                                  case the submarine cable map I really                                  recommend checking out the submarine                                  cable map will will show you all of the                                  a map of all of the undersea cables that                                  make this thing called the internet                                  actually work and you can click on these                                  cables and you can see the companies                                  that own them you'll be very                                  hard-pressed to find a single government                                  that has even a share in these cables                                  well when I was teaching in North Danya                                  vasilyev a studio partner in in Peru we                                  asked them to find a Peruvian activist                                  blog and we which showed them a little                                  bit about packet tracing they typed in                                  the URL and we showed them that that the                                  network traffic went went from the east                                  of the west coast of the South American                                  continent over to the east coast hopped                                  over to Madrid and then over into the                                  into the east coast of the US where the                                  site was actually hosted be effectively                                  showed them that that all of the                                  Peruvian traffic at least in that part                                  of Peru was being tunneled through their                                  conquest Adil's through through the                                  Spanish you know that that that their                                  sovereignty had just moved up and it had                                  been usurped by the corporate domain                                  submarine cable map is amazing it's                                  really about seeing the land through the                                  clouds I'm going to talk now finally the                                  last thing is about news tweak                                  that I guess seeks to address both trust                                  and infrastructure alongside the the the                                  the issue of the Commons and

          this project was done by Danny Vasily                                  Evan and myself it's it's basically got                                  this this this treatise behind every                                  mind as a network on it it takes the                                  form of a very very dreary drab boring                                  wall plug this is simple little

                       and and it's it's now all over the world                                  we uploaded the instructions to build it                                  and they're turning up right
