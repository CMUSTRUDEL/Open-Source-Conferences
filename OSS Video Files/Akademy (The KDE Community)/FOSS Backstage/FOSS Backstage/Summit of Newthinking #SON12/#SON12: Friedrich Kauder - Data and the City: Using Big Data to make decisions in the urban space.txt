Title: #SON12: Friedrich Kauder - Data and the City: Using Big Data to make decisions in the urban space
Publication date: 2020-02-21
Playlist: Summit of Newthinking #SON12
Description: 
	Any kind of human settlement quickly manifests the social relations between its inhabitants in the physical world. This has never been truer than it is in the modern city: citizens shape their neighbourhoods and their neighbourhoods in turn shape them; skyscrapers are the concrete face of power and the shape and density of the road and public transportation networks show who is well connected and who is left behind.

Understanding the character of the city is vital to deciding where to start a new business or where to find a home. Unfortuantely, many aspects of life in the city are subtle and ever-evolving: a place with great transportation connections may turn into a nightmare as trains turn out to be running all night; yesterday's run-down factory can be the heart of tomorrow's trendsetting district. Most decisions in the urban space have profound consequences for people's future. How then can Open Data be used to help make the right choice?

This talk would briefly review the wealth of Open Data available in the United Kingdom via government sources and the relevance of open initiatives such as OpenStreetMap in understanding the urban space. It would then look at how this data is critical to informing decisions made by people and businesses, illustrate how Home on Demand employs Open Data to allow tenants and landlords to make more efficient decisions in the property market and finally discuss the opportunities and challenges of using data in this particular space.

	                              [Music]                               is this on yeah sounds like it                               perfect so welcome to the next open data                               talk after me figuring out how the                               presentation actually works and its data                               and the city using big data to make                               decisions in the urban space which is                               just about the longest title I could                               possibly fit on one slide so I'm                                representing home on demand which is a                                start-up in the u.s. now incubator of Mo                                being scot-free and fancies here in                                Berlin which is basically a huge real                                estate portal largest in Europe and I                                think after China the world so it's                                gonna be really about this kind of real                                estate urban space and what I wanted to                                do is briefly introduce myself and what                                we were working on talk about the city                                as a social network and the way people                                commonly understand it currently and                                then really go into open data what is                                available there what we're working with                                and how we can put it to work to really                                work for four people and then of course                                people are important to look at the                                consumer side before hopefully I will                                have a good discussion let me just set                                up my timer actually so I can make sure                                okay I think we look more or less                                complete so in the spirit of a startup                                let's iterate and pivot and once again                                with more feeling most of you have                                already heard the introduction but still                                this talk is about data and the city                                using big data to make decisions in the                                urban space and hopefully I'll be able                                to make sense of that title in the                                course of this talk so I'm representing                                home on demand which is a start-up in                                the u.s. now incubator of lima bean                                scotf in spanish in berlin here in                                mobians guardians once Isis or                                        want to stay in English completely is                                one of the largest real estate portals                                in the world and they are working with                                lots of data and so are we so it's a                                good fit I wanted to introduce myself                                and our project before talking about                                about a bit about data in the city and                                how a city is understood and how it                                should be understood perhaps going to                                open data on what kind of data we are                                working it with what is actually                                available about how to put this data to                                work for people and how people in our                                case consumers can be empowered using                                that data and then hopefully we'll have                                time for a good discussion so a bit                                about myself I'm the CTO of home on                                demand but my background is a bit                                checkered for someone doing that either                                bachelor's in sociology I have a                                master's in political communication and                                now I'm wondering how to keep a database                                server up and running and how to use                                instances in the cloud so that's quite a                                journey and the you know the if you will                                the advantage and disadvantage of that                                is that I can talk about a lot of things                                but I'm also wrong about a lot of things                                so in the spirit of open data you know                                part of the discussion is you know if                                you have an idea if you have something                                make sure to tell me where I'm wrong now                                home on demand is a london-based startup                                and loading a lot of focus startup and                                we do recommendations for properties in                                urban markets so we try to find you                                something                                that really suits what you need and for                                that we make sense of the market using                                open data and what we try to do is not                                only you know bring up this data in a                                sense that you don't understand but you                                guide you through the process now you                                can check out the site if you happen to                                look for a flat in London but you should                                keep in mind it's basically                                currently a technology platform so don't                                expect everything to work correctly                                exactly like this talk so I wanted to                                talk a bit about the city because we                                think it's an extremely interesting                                thing to deal with and most everyone who                                are who lives in the city for quite a                                while will believe that they understand                                that city if they look for a place they                                think they know what they're doing                                 but in many cases they are used simply                                 heuristics to get along and make the                                 decisions and that's something my                                 co-founder realized when he and in a bad                                 way actually when he forced himself to                                 move this summer to test some of our                                 concepts so he went to a real estate                                 agent and he had this kind of                                 neighborhood in mind that he liked and                                 the real estate agent said to him                                 yeah this that's kind of a nice                                 neighborhood but they are not you know                                 many British people there and by British                                 people she of course meant white people                                 so she already used a fairly dangerous                                 heuristic where she conveyed the sense                                 that if you have a lot of people with an                                 immigration background in a certain part                                 of the city that's the negative thing                                 now if we look at what the distribution                                 is actually like here that's white                                 British people in London if you wanted                                 to live in a neighborhood that is                                 entirely British entirely white you                                 would live in the outskirts where most                                 people actually don't want to live for                                 for various reasons and there's a sense                                 that you know what she also said is that                                 you should avoid East London because                                 there are many non British people by                                 which she meant Pakistanis and this                                 again is a heuristic that doesn't work                                 on a moral level but also she doesn't                                 know that so that clusters of                                 communities in London that people are                                 not aware of and they make very general                                 statements                                 that can be quite dangerous simply                                 because of a lack of understanding if we                                 look at what she really was getting up                                 at that there are neighborhoods that are                                 more affluent and less affluent you can                                 see that that has nothing to do with                                 these kind of communities even though                                 most people I talk to believe that so                                 East London is indeed a more problematic                                 area but there are problematic areas                                 across London and people concentrate                                 this kind of sense in the heuristic                                 saying East London's a problem because                                 the communities there which is flat-out                                 wrong                                 if you look at education something that                                 people also worry about you see that                                 it's completely spread so it's already                                 difficult to follow this cat these kind                                 of maps and that's because a city is a                                 very complex organism and I'm only                                 showing you a couple of layers where                                 already people have ideas where they                                 believe they understand when really it                                 is too complex to make sense off in a                                 simple way for example so people believe                                 they have to live in the centre to get                                 anywhere and if you look at this map                                 where what is red is or violet the                                 ideally is places that have great                                 mobility you do have great mobility in                                 the centre but you also have very decent                                 ways to get to other places outside that                                 extreme centre and most people                                 interestingly in London I'm not sure how                                 it is in Berlin are simply not aware of                                 that and they the problem is they are                                 not aware that they are not aware of it                                 they believe they know the city and they                                 believe that those things hold                                 absolutely true but they don't so what                                 we found out is that everything is                                 connected and that the city is really a                                 network of different layers of                                 information and trade-offs you might                                 have a place that you like like this                                 place this world where I put the house                                 icon which is smaller that is close to                                 people you like and close to apart but                                 that doesn't have great transportation                                 then there might be a place that you                                 really like but you're worried about the                                 level                                 crime there while you like the access to                                 transportation but it's a trade-off                                 because you're in the center you have                                 great transportation and you have a                                 problem with crime and so in a sense you                                 face those trade-offs and most people                                 are not fully aware of why those                                 trade-off exists and whether there are                                 options that go beyond that so this is                                 kind of a problem we're looking at the                                 just amount of data that is required                                 information that is required to                                 understand even the city you live in and                                 the question is how can we make sense of                                 it and in London especially we work with                                 a lot of really good open data and                                 that's thanks to us very strong open                                 data movement in the UK that from my                                 perspective started with a very early                                 Freedom of Information Act where really                                 people went and said your department I                                 don't have to bag you are required to                                 give me that information we have that                                 too in Germany since                                                   respects we are still far behind as you                                 probably know better much better than I                                 do                                 since                                                                 licence partly pushed by the Guardians                                 free our data movement and basically it                                 took this idea to the logical conclusion                                 saying you know we don't only have to                                 ask for data but if it's collected with                                 our money it should be available to us                                 as well                                 Jeremy is I think not quite there yet                                 but we're catching up I mean just look                                 around you and this conference I wanted                                 to give an example of what people do in                                 the UK with that data and again I think                                 you might have from what I've seen heard                                 about this before one of the                                 organizations that we really look at as                                 a positive example what you can do with                                 data is my society and my society is in                                 a democracy charity that has as its goal                                 to empower people using that available                                 data and they use open data and they                                 also publish as open source to kind of                                 code their building so I put the URL                                 there if you're interested you can use                                 most of their services put them                                 on a server and run them which is just                                 fantastic they've also been involved in                                 political lobbying to make this open                                 date widely available and to keep the                                 process running they were involved in                                 getting inspire on the you level which                                 is a standard for open data and they                                 helped in the in power of information                                 task force in the UK which tries to make                                 data really in a USP of the UK so that's                                 great one of the examples of what                                 they've been doing is fixed my street                                 which is basically a way to to report                                 problems crowdsource problems that you                                 have in your street where something is                                 damaged and repaired using open data to                                 supplement that what I think many of you                                 have seen in the last talk is travel                                 time maps where you see how long it will                                 take you to go to a certain place so                                 these are all based on reopened data                                 OpenStreetMap data and the available                                 transportation data but that's really                                 more data available in the UK for                                 example if you look at the police it's a                                 completely different ballgame I've                                 talked to someone here who are built the                                 Suffocation's app which is a an app                                 showing crime on on you know a map for                                 Germany and the reaction to that from                                 the police but also from public and                                 media waswas completely negative in many                                 cases especially from the police it was                                 experts have to look at this this data                                 is misleading it is discriminatory to                                 show certain areas of cities that have                                 problems with crime so that was there                                 was all a positive reaction in the case                                 of the UK are the police has its own                                 site that does exactly that so the data                                 we're working with in the UK are looking                                 at crime for you is you know every crime                                 at every spots which officers were                                 involved dealing with                                 and what the outcomes are so this data                                 is really available and it's not only                                 available in a sort of hidden sense but                                 the UK police runs its own website that                                 has                                                                    you can zoom in and find out what your                                 neighborhood looks like and what                                 happened then there's also noise data                                 which unfortunately is not completely                                 open you can access some information but                                 we would have to buy it we haven't yet                                 so but the state has at least available                                 in some sort of sense where they show                                 you the data they use for building                                 permits and other official ways of                                 dealing with noise and as you can see                                 it's fairly detailed so there's a lot of                                 data it's a lot of data that is not only                                 available in UK but also across the                                 world and one of our greatest data                                 sources is through the OpenStreetMap                                 which i think many of you again will be                                 familiar with but for us is fantastic                                 because having all that Google Maps has                                 and more at our fingertips and being                                 able to go into that looking at the data                                 and saying this is the building there                                 this is the street and it's not only a                                 street but I saw it's a highway and                                 having for example in our case the                                 location of basically every single tree                                 in London individually to provide some                                 measurement of saying this neighborhood                                 is green for example is Natale fantastic                                 so we wanted to briefly just look at the                                 data sources that we use for what we are                                 doing as I said first and foremost as                                 OpenStreetMap data we use market data                                 really the properties that are available                                 which of course is not necessarily open                                 source but we crawl a lot of data and we                                 got a very firm legal opinion that                                 that's fine we use transit data but I                                 think you just had a good discussion                                 about the problems in Germany was quite                                 freely available in the UK we used to                                 crime date                                 I talked about we will use the noise                                 data although this again it's not really                                 open source or open data and we use                                 demographic data that I think is far                                 more detail than anything that you can                                 get in Germany at the moment but some of                                 it you can get at least for for Berlin                                 and we believe there are some                                 substitutes that you can do for example                                 I talked about the filtration set which                                 emulates some of the functionality of                                 this crime data so if you ask me if                                 something like we do in the UK can be                                 done in in Berlin if you can try to                                 understand the city at this point with                                 the open data that is available in                                 Germany my answer would be it's a bit                                 harder but I think it can be done so you                                 shouldn't limit your thinking even                                 though Germany is a bit behind in this                                 respect now what we found is the really                                 hard part is making sense of the state                                 and that's a process we're still in I                                 think it's important and I get back to                                 that that using open data in the sense                                 of just showing you tables doesn't work                                 for most people so you have to kind of                                 make sense of this data and build models                                 for it what is safe we looked at                                 Westminster which is kind of a party                                 area and if you take the pure open data                                 the pure crime data that we have and you                                 map it and you compare it to other parts                                 of the city it looks like a war zone                                 because people get beaten up after going                                 to club there's drug use and so on but                                 that's not the reality of people's lives                                 they go there on a weekday during the                                 day and it's a safe neighborhood so                                 people were very confused when we showed                                 them the kind of raw data I think that's                                 that's a great takeaway that it has to                                 make sense it has to be building a model                                 of human understanding on top of the                                 data that is available just having the                                 data it's not enough and what we also                                 found                                 is that averages don't work what I say                                 for me is maybe not safe for you so                                 having this human components going a bit                                 beyond the pure date and personalizing                                 it was extremely important for us and                                 also it's very difficult I showed you                                 the the city so far having those                                 judgments one of some of them are                                 completely nonlinear so you want to be                                 close to close the street but you don't                                 want to be too close so that makes it                                 complicated to to look at those                                 relationships in a city so how do we put                                 it to work in practice                                 and just scratching the surface but so                                 our first step that we found is that we                                 can use open data to help people                                 understand their needs because the                                 primary problem is that when people                                 start looking for a place they have some                                 idea but they don't really know what's                                 out there they use the kind of                                 heuristics that I touched upon when I                                 talked about the city often wrong and                                 they they don't really know what to                                 expect so what we are trying to do is                                 use the data that is available make                                 sense of it and show people the kind of                                 trade-offs and structures that they're                                 facing structural problems really                                 because a lot of people want to have                                 something like a garden in the center of                                 the city or maybe they are not that                                 extreme but very close to the center and                                 that's just not happening and if you                                 tell someone that and you give them the                                 data to work with that they understand                                 that and they they okay with that but                                 what they're currently doing is they're                                 using a standard property search and                                 they keep searching keep getting                                 disappointed until they finally figure                                 it out and we think by making the market                                 more transparent and showing those                                 trade-offs we can make that process more                                 efficient more transparent and we can                                 give people a chance to not narrow down                                 to to a neighborhood because what people                                 often do is they end up looking around                                 the place they already know                                 or they miss a lot of things along the                                 way and we try to help them shape their                                 needs in a way that works and then of                                 course the next important step is                                 actually helping them find a place so                                 people are overwhelmed by the kind of                                 data that is already the market data so                                 just knowing what kind of properties are                                 there you can't go through all of them                                 so if there's a standardized process to                                 look through them for you that is                                 something most people find incredibly                                 helpful                                 what we need is is really well the                                 market data and what we also need is                                 people's preferences so what we do is we                                 really ask a quiz if you'll have a                                 laptop you can check it out in the home                                 on demand code UK the your a live show                                 so basically you describe what you're                                 looking for we saved that information we                                 compare it against what's available on                                 the market we make sense of it using our                                 understanding of the city and then we                                 give you recommendations and it's really                                 are the core of what we're doing is                                 using that understanding of the city                                 that we have two people's advantage the                                 kind of infrastructure we're using is                                 luckily in the cloud which makes my life                                 a little easier so we use AWS Amazon Web                                 Services for scalability we use Postgres                                 databases if you ever doing something                                 with Geo data I I advise you to to give                                 posts a try because it's it's really                                 great and we ask jungle which is a front                                 and a web framework for Python which is                                 a programming language that really                                 allows rapid development and of course                                 we use a lot of stuff in the jquery area                                 for the front end so i'm just briefly                                 going through that for anyone who is                                 interested in that kind of stuff and if                                 you have any questions about how that                                 works talk to me but the core of it is                                 that                                 if you're working with this much data                                 you have to start thinking about those                                 principles and I sure had having no                                 background in that before and that's                                 that's important but I think we figured                                 out is that or is he more important than                                 having the data was more important than                                 you know processing the data and having                                 a technical infrastructure and being all                                 happy with that is to really think of                                 open data from the perspective of the                                 consumer because or of the user consumer                                 is a commercial term and doesn't have to                                 be in many cases it shouldn't be as my                                 society shows but it has to start from a                                 need if you think about open data and                                 many people and we did do is as                                 something that is great because it's                                 there and we have all this data and now                                 we have to do something with it                                 that's dangerous because maybe people                                 don't want it so I wanted to talk a bit                                 and in a bit more detail since I have a                                 bit more time about the consumer side of                                 open data I wants to kind of give a bit                                 of a cautionary tale because we started                                 at the wrong end and we thought about                                 how to make this whole thing as                                 complicated and complex and powerful as                                 possible and when we started we we build                                 a concept where you could kind of enter                                 open text so you could say I want be                                 next to a tube line in the center of the                                 city or have something really safe and                                 green in the outskirts so you could                                 really just kind of Google like type in                                 what you want and it would process this                                 into some kind of structure that said I                                 want to include these things and I want                                 to exclude these things and this is also                                 already a simplified version of what we                                 use and we were very proud of that                                 because it really used data and the open                                 data that we had to the max and then                                 people sat in front of it and they were                                 like how does that work what is this                                 anyway                                 can you explain that to me and we did                                 explain to them and they still didn't                                 get it so that was the point at which we                                 started to really look beyond the data                                 angle because all this great open data                                 that is available really doesn't help                                 anyone if the interface the way people                                 interact with it doesn't work for them                                 and we ended up with something that was                                 much simpler but it works for almost                                 anyone and people you know immediately                                 understand what it's all about so I                                 think there's a tendency if you if you                                 deal with data if you deal with                                 something were as I showed you it's                                 pretty obvious that some people have                                 used pretty simple heuristics even if                                 they are for example in our case                                 professional estate agents and you look                                 at your data and you think okay we're                                 that much smarter and we understand                                 things that you get wrong and we can                                 help people that you you sort of                                 patronize people and push it on them and                                 say look this is your recommendation                                 this is what we came up with it's great                                 use it and that also something that I                                 think it's not in the spirit of open                                 data and it's also something that the                                 movement if you will should avoid                                 because what we found when we when we                                 did our first recommendations was that                                 if we just give a list and attach scores                                 to it and don't explain to people why we                                 came up with that people react very                                 negatively it's it's something that's                                 pushed on them it's not something that                                 they feel they own and as complex us all                                 this is we think there's a there's a                                 possibility to get people to own open                                 data even if they are not nerds like I                                 am and I think the key to that is                                 understand the weaknesses and the                                 strengths of people because what most                                 people are pretty weak at is                                 understanding statistics so if you just                                 show a bell curve and                                 you try to get people make sense of that                                 they won't it's it's something that                                 doesn't work for most people if you show                                 an interface that works they they kind                                 of understand it so the solution in our                                 case was to repackage data to be kind of                                 understandable and kind of actionable                                 and since I really have a whole lot of                                 time at this point I thought or I think                                 I'll just briefly show what the website                                 actually looks like                                 [Music]                                 so what we found is it matters to get                                 people interested in this we had a                                 beginning but chose correctly that was                                 their very data-driven and the users we                                 had and the users we tested it with they                                 really didn't connect with it because it                                 had no emotional value it was pure data                                 once we started to turn into something                                 that is fun and that is visible and                                 visual and has a decent design people                                 started to connect to the data in a                                 completely different way they started to                                 see the benefit that it would hold for                                 them                                 you saw kind of our failed project where                                 we just had this kind of Windows like                                 Windows structure with floating windows                                 and lots of things that people didn't                                 understand we in the end to revert it to                                 something that's very straightforward                                 which is just a questionnaire if you                                 will but one that we try to give a                                 better design and we are asking those                                 questions and we're not asking we're not                                 narrowing down we don't say you know                                 there are only                                                          your criteria but we try on an emotional                                 level to get what you really want and                                 then make those recommendations and                                 describe what those recommendations are                                 based on so when I do this you know what                                 happens here with us those points has                                 absolutely no effects on your                                 registration but flat out doubles the                                 amount of information people put in so                                 it has no function whatsoever but gave                                 me fiying it just a little bit made a                                 huge difference so people can describe                                 in broad terms where they want to live                                 we realized very quickly that asking the                                 questions is extremely powerful because                                 we used to give people a kind of                                 throwback to what we had before the                                 opportunity to add as many neighborhoods                                 they like that most people really added                                 exactly one exactly like they would in a                                 traditional search on a mobile Scout or                                 the English equivalents so we started                                 asking in broader terms what would be                                 kind of acceptable to you and people are                                 happy with that they they put in broad                                 areas that they are interested in and                                 then they put some cherries on top and                                 say these kind of neighborhoods I would                                 love to live in if possible so that                                 already changes completely the way                                 people interact and it's not a                                 technology problem it's really an                                 interface problem we ask about commuting                                 times and what you use to commute we ask                                 about topics that you care about because                                 not everyone needs school information if                                 you don't have kids you don't want that                                 we personalize it by asking what's                                 walking distance for you and what kind                                 of what kind of places you like to avoid                                 and again it's different for everyone we                                 have to figure out what what dodgy means                                 to you along the way but we want to get                                 at what's important to you and then we                                 ask questions about really the property                                 itself how many bedrooms how many                                 bathrooms what kind of rooms you want                                 and what kind of features you're looking                                 for maybe you want a gas stove maybe in                                 pool in case you want proper double                                 glazed windows I don't know but we want                                 to know it from you and then you                                 register in the end and we can start                                 building a relationship and what we do                                 is every every day you will get property                                 recommendations we're experimenting with                                 this it's not really done we were a bit                                 inspired by Pinterest because we think                                 people don't need to see all those                                 descriptions that say this is an                                 excellent property and if an amazing                                 neighborhood trust me I'm an agent but                                 we simply collect here the kind of                                 keywords that match and why so what's                                 highlighted there is my personal                                 preference I would like to live in a                                 modern                                 apartment and if at all possible I'd                                 like a garden even though I know that's                                 not realistic in London at all but the                                 system can tell me that so this is kind                                 of what we came up with after dealing                                 with all those kind of data-driven                                 problems and we also realized that no                                 matter how good our algorithm will be in                                 the end we will not be able to make                                 every recommendation great so if you get                                 to                                                                  happen is automatically you will have                                 some recommendations that are complete                                 crap and then it's a question how how do                                 you deal with that do you say okay I'm                                 gonna hire more developer so I make the                                 model much more complex and maybe I you                                 know gain another percent here and there                                 maybe I get it to                                                      just say okay we know there's a problem                                 we know we will never be perfect but we                                 involve you as the user in this process                                 and we realize that something people                                 really wants just throwing back to this                                 kind of question of patronizing or                                 involving the user where the interface                                 plays a huge role to say even though we                                 own this data even though we work with                                 this data and we give this data to you                                 you're still part of the process and I                                 think that's something that was quite                                 important for us to move beyond this                                 where you say oh you know big data in                                 our case using a lot of open data it's                                 just something prescriptive and we want                                 to use this data to build relationships                                 on this you know basis of respect to say                                 first of all we don't make statistical                                 you know assumptions about you that I                                 paid based on averages we personalize it                                 just because you know the average person                                 likes gardens you don't have to you're                                 registered you tell us what you want we                                 don't and for everything even though we                                 could and we get to know you as                                 person we show you cause and effect so                                 if you tell us that recommendation was                                 crap we need to be able to show nothing                                 like that again to you and we need to                                 accept that you know better what you                                 want then we do I was an interesting                                 conference with telecom which owns a                                 mobile scout                                 last week and they talked a bit about                                 how they can use data to evaluate their                                 customers and make inferences about                                 their customers at some point I just                                 said why don't you just ask them they                                 will answer so there's limits to to this                                 kind of data-driven approach and there's                                 a ways to make it work in a kind of                                 cooperative setting which I think is                                 important and by doing that instead of                                 just telling them something and they                                 walk away happy or unhappy you can use                                 this data to build relationships it's                                 very early but I think I'll just open                                 for discussion I think if you have a                                 question you have to come up but                                 otherwise I'll come up with something to                                 talk about really so hurry                                 hi and thanks a lot for your talk I                                 really enjoyed it and very specific                                 question you said like your vita                                 interface at the end looks like the one                                 example on your website where you had                                 the crime statistics still there in                                 detail before you said you don't want to                                 give all the data that you have visible                                 and there was something like                                           beaten up here three cars damaged kind                                 of stuff like that have you thought                                 about just from the user perspective                                 turn that positive like very safe                                 environment etc etc that's a great                                 question because if you actually look at                                 the I'm going to show you so you know                                 what what we've been talking about here                                 if you look at this crime first of all                                 it has a gun which totally doesn't work                                 for anyone and it just dumps the data on                                 you so it just tells you exactly in a in                                 a fifteen minute walking radius what                                 went wrong in the last month in your                                 neighborhood and I can tell you with                                 some certainty that completely doesn't                                 work for anyone we - that's part of our                                 experiment here so what we had                                 originally was just a kind of marker                                 saying this is above average for this                                 kind of zone or below average or this is                                 really dangerous people didn't get that                                 either because it's too much of a                                 simplification to say this is our                                 judgment and people hated that so we for                                 experimental reasons we went into                                 complete opposite direction and just                                 gave them the exact information that we                                 had and they hated that as well because                                 it scares them it's very difficult to                                 compare and it's very difficult to make                                 sense of because currently we don't use                                 any kind of comparison market here to                                 say what does it actually mean to me so                                 what you see is really that's why I'm                                 saying it's the technology platform is                                 like we try to recently find out how                                 people react to the other extreme and                                 it's definitely something in between so                                 I think that's a great question and                                 that's definitely something where                                 completely contradicts what I told you                                 before I mean what first of all I I mean                                 it's part of things that we still need                                 to figure out but there are ways to                                 combine judgment judgment with with this                                 so what we tested but not in this                                 version is to use statistics for most of                                 the parts and use judgment for others so                                 most of the crime in London is in a                                 fairly reasonable range so you can say                                 this is more dangerous than that but                                 they are outliers like I talked about                                 with Westminster that have those party                                 areas and if you are say if you simply                                 attach the label to it saying yeah this                                 looks really high but you know this is                                 the background why it is high people                                 reacted in our tests fairly positively                                 to that so I think what really helps is                                 a quick sum up sentence if you will even                                 to say this is because it's that but                                 take it with a grain of salt it's just                                 weekends so there's a human factor I                                 think that's goes beyond just those pure                                 statistics do you have a more basically                                 stuff like I'm living in a sort of a                                 crappy area and if you're new in town                                 you're pretty high you have a pretty                                 good chance you get robbed I know                                 everybody everybody knows me nothing                                 happens it's perfect everybody takes                                 care for each other so how do you put                                 that into a statistic way of like this                                 is a set because generally basically                                 it's really a safe area but I was                                 wondering how you put that into sketches                                 like absolutely I mean well we I talk                                 very briefly about human judgment and                                 that kind of factor and I think what we                                 all have to do and what we started doing                                 is getting people involved who really                                 know the city on a on a on                                 on a personal level when a personal or                                 or you know in a broader sense so we                                 talk for example to bloggers about great                                 spy crews in London because we can we                                 can take those roots from OpenStreetMap                                 the data is there but first of all                                 that's pretty plain and we don't really                                 have any subjective knowledge of this so                                 what we got is that people who blog are                                 really interested in providing their                                 take on this to put it into context and                                 we can integrate it and give people that                                 context to work with so I think it's the                                 same for for crime you want to move                                 beyond something where you simply crunch                                 the data and you want to put on top of                                 that if you will expert judgment and if                                 you can something crowd-sourced though I                                 have to say from the experience that                                 other people have made with crowdsource                                 neighborhood data that didn't work so                                 well so there may be ways to do it this                                 I have to be honest beyond what we're                                 currently working with but we think                                 there may be ways to get people involved                                 directly to for example get your                                 expertise in your area but you have to                                 be sure to give something back the kind                                 of approaches that we've seen mobian                                 Scott has something like that where they                                 kind of just take your judgment but use                                 it commercially without really giving                                 anything back to you didn't work well at                                 all so it's something we we hope that if                                 the service that we're building works so                                 fantastically well that you feel that by                                 judging your area helping others for                                 example you improve your own experience                                 as well this might be something that                                 works but the fallback option would be                                 really to go to people who know those                                 areas media people people who write                                 guides and to integrate their subjective                                 data to put the statistics into context                                 so um the question was why I refer to to                                 crunching data instead of say cracking                                 it and that is just the terminology I'm                                 aware of but it has no you know deeper                                 meaning I mean what we're doing in                                 practice and what we have to do what you                                 know means in practice is not using that                                 kind of raw data like the crime numbers                                 absolute numbers but to build a model                                 around it that makes sense of it and for                                 me that's crunching data but for other                                 people it might be model building so                                 it's just the term                                 is there a general interest in in a                                 certain aspect of it that I could go                                 into bit deeper I mean we I could talk a                                 bit deeper about the data availability                                 side I could talk about the interface                                 side okay so data let's let's go to                                 straight data I think the comparison is                                 great because that's really if you go to                                 Berlin's data portal that and pump                                 bellini pump D I think you can see they                                 have a few data sets but if you go to                                 the UK and if you look what it's                                 available they're also beyond the focus                                 of what I present it because it's part                                 that's the data we use it's fantastic so                                 what they do is if you have a local                                 council and you do of course that spends                                 money beyond I think                                                     that on the internet so you can look at                                 your local council and you can get full                                 lists of what they spend their money on                                 you can get on the kind of medication                                 that doctors prescribe in their general                                 practices within the Health Service of                                 the UK the NHS so you have                                           sets on data cough that UK that you can                                 work with it is a difference to to                                 what's available in Germany simply                                 because they are required to open this                                 data and they do open that data it's a                                 matter of what you're trying to do                                 my feeling is looking at that data is                                 that if you want to do something in the                                 health sector that's fantastic if you                                 want to do something like we do with geo                                 data understanding neighborhoods                                 understanding you know the urban                                 environment that's fantastic too because                                 that's a lot of data that I've not been                                 talking about that we don't currently                                 use they have data on how much of a                                 certain neighborhood is taken up by                                 factories by concrete                                 it is lakes and seas they have pollution                                 they have amazing demographic data about                                 you know the kind of people that live                                 around your place what kind of jobs they                                 have the nekkid emic do they work in                                 retail all this data is at least on the                                 neighborhood level or in a sub                                 neighborhood level available and                                 actually one of the discussions I had at                                 the telecom conference is that I                                 presented this and I talked about how                                 great it is to have this data and                                 someone working quite high up and                                 telecom turned to me and said yeah but                                 is it really that great because I have                                 fear for my privacy so I think I mean                                 this might not be a forum where we                                 disagree much but I think when in                                 Germany still exists and so I don't want                                 to dismiss it out of hand if you look at                                 the kind of situation that Google Google                                 Maps is facing is that yes this much                                 data is available but the question is                                 culturally do people feel that that's                                 appropriate is that something that                                 people feel comfortable with I talked                                 about how we are moving in this                                 direction where we might approach                                 data.gov that UK but I'm still not                                 entirely sure if that's something that                                 can work in Germany like do the doctors                                 really want to show what they are                                 prescribing is that something that will                                 fly here and I know show of hands who                                 thinks that this something as too much                                 open data yeah I figured ok maybe are                                 just giving briefly my assessment of the                                 direction that we're going in because as                                 you see not quite assisting in the                                 political sphere as well my                                 understanding is that in many ways the                                 open data process in the UK was driven                                 by media but also like                                 companies I mean the reason they are the                                 government's are doing this now in the                                 UK is not only because I think it's a                                 great issue and because they are feel                                 passionate about open data but because                                 many people many companies come to them                                 and say it's a you know as a competitive                                 advantage to have the state and to work                                 with it                                 and if you ask me why I think this will                                 happen in Germany as well and why we're                                 in this process I think it's less                                 because there's a philosophical                                 underpinning where people feel extremely                                 comfortable with the idea of getting                                 this data out there the departments will                                 always fight this in fact the department                                 in the UK that has all this geo data                                 that we are using they got a first-class                                  lawyer to shut it down this whole open                                  data movement in the UK so it's not like                                  it when all seamlessly there was a lot                                  of fight back and there will be a lot of                                  fight back here but I think what drives                                  the process in the end is really you                                  know the desire to have a competitive                                  advantage and if it shows in the UK and                                  part of that that it is a competitive                                  advantage of access to the state that                                  will happen here out of necessity and                                  not out of goodwill and I think it would                                  be right for the open data movement to                                  look at this aspect and not only lobby                                  in the sense of its a democratic way to                                  do it but also to just practically go                                  out there and say if you want to have                                  growth in technology this is what needs                                  to be done and hopefully as half German                                  startup we can be part of it in that                                  sense that we give back in many ways but                                  in this way as well as saying this is                                  something that you can make money with                                  and this is why it's a good idea                                  is there interest in the technology                                  slide I only touched that very briefly                                  or say you I think you had do you have                                  maybe specific questions about the data                                  that is available in the UK okay                                  I was interesting in how many other                                  organizations than the police taking                                  putting effort in transferring Excel                                  data into maps the question about maps                                  there are a lot of efforts especially                                  from startups to put stuff on maps I                                  mean this is especially true for for the                                  real estate sector where I mean we are                                  fairly non map based but there are a lot                                  of real estate startups that start with                                  a map exclusively the only government                                  department that I'm aware of that uses                                  like a completely map centric approach                                  like the police thought UK website is in                                  fact you know the police itself it might                                  make less sense for the NHS apart from                                  finding your local doctor put this                                  information on in a very geo focused way                                  so I think you know the map vision is                                  more part of of the private sector in                                  the UK that at least I'm aware of then                                  public so but you should check out the                                  police website because it's a fantastic                                  way of evaluating neighbourhoods and                                  it's fantastic example for the police                                  here I mean that's what they should do                                  and as there are German versions that do                                  it in a similar way I think in a more                                  general sense when it comes to maps we                                  started off in fact with something that                                  was a big map with you know kind of                                  showing all the data that we had on this                                  map and that's very fancy and lots of                                  people get a good positive reaction on                                  the first the first time they look at it                                  but what we found is that people have                                  extreme differences difficulties looking                                  at small differences in color if you map                                  and they kind of heat map fashion on                                  such a map so that's why we kind of turn                                  away from that and a                                  I suspect that's why many other data                                  providers in the UK for example the NHS                                  don't use a map based approach because                                  some data really doesn't fit there so                                  well especially when it gets complicated                                  I mean I I showed you this and I was                                  hoping that you would get a bit confused                                  because that makes the point let me get                                  there let's assume worse but when I                                  would tell you to tell me what the                                  neighborhood's were the best education                                  are and those up the darker ones here                                  just gets very difficult to figure out                                  spread across the town there are certain                                  clusters but what we realized when we                                  did exactly this kind of thing with our                                  data is that it doesn't work certain                                  stuff doesn't work which I mean it's                                  basically the interface question right                                  just having this kind of data it's good                                  putting it on such a map in terms of                                  education it's also good but if you can                                  ask people how old are your kids what                                  kind of schools are you looking for what                                  kind of subjects matter to you and then                                  you give them a detailed output then                                  it's something we found in this space                                  people found more useful                                  [Music]                                  so okay uh I take it there are no other                                  questions I've I'll bang on just two                                  more minutes                                  about the interface thing because that                                  was really take away and such a                                  conference that is really focusing on                                  data                                  I just wanted to drive this point home                                  because it was important to us people                                  didn't even get to these things that we                                  found important because they were                                  completely turned off way by the                                  interface so well I mean what you want                                  to do is is have interactivity you wanna                                  if you want to show a map you should                                  show a map where people can click on                                  things where people can interact with                                  these things and where people can see a                                  result of their interest narrowing down                                  the data working with the data I think                                  in the police that you canes website                                  which is generally fantastic has more to                                  do there so if you go out there and you                                  want to do something with open data be                                  its commercial beards are non-commercial                                  for pure benefit of the public get                                  someone who understands data get someone                                  who understands databases but also think                                  about getting a designer and getting                                  someone who knows the user experience                                  and because in the end I was it comes                                  down to the interests of people is there                                  we looked when we started at the number                                  of people who use kind of Statistics                                  portals that exist in the UK many of                                  them use five at a time they compare but                                  they can't make sense of it and that's                                  why we integrated inserts enjoy open                                  data cherish open data make it work but                                  make sure to make it work for the user                                  and that's I think well I end up thank                                  you                                  [Music]
