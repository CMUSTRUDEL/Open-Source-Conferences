Title: #SON12: Stephen Kovats - #OSJUBA Open Sourcing a New Capital
Publication date: 2020-02-21
Playlist: Summit of Newthinking #SON12
Description: 
	After more than four decades of brutal conflict, South Sudan, the world's newest country gained independence. A complex multi-cultural and multi-ethnic mesh of peoples and competing interests, the new state seceded from Sudan after a referendum for independence supported by close to 99% of its population. Juba, nominally a capital since the 1972 Addis peace accords granted the South autonomy, this dusty regional administrative town now finds itself in the eye of a storm of competing interests, speculation and hectic unbridled development - a chaotic city juggling 'nation building' against the sheer basics of urban survival.

A capital city is however a unique place. Vested in symbolic attribution and a nationâ€™s aspirations it must act as both an efficient administrator as much as the showcase of the nation's identity. In the case of a new state still working to define its own cultural and societal contours, the capital city takes on an even greater symbolic - as well as pivotal function. In Juba, this is a free-for-all dominated by the interests of external powers jockeying for pole position in a potentially lucrative battle for natural resources. Having acted as guarantor for the fledgling state's viability to survive as an independent nation, South Sudan's oil reserves, fertile lands and Nile waters now become its accessible rewards. Who will gain the upper hand in their exploitation, and how will its citizens experience not only the symbolic assets of freedom, but participate in its autonomy and self-determination?
The world's first Open Source City?

#OSJUBA proposes to apply the means and methodologies of the international Open Source / FLOSS, free culture, accessible technologies and hacktivist communities in creating a vision for the new capital of South Sudan. Building a model to be applied in the broader context of an emergent, transparent and participatory democracy Open Source methodologies also play a crucial role in fusing diverse cultural traditions into existing, established and highly engaged global communities. Their inherent elements of cultural collaboration, grass-roots enterprise and economic innovation are driven by multidisciplinary ideals that have the ability to support and augment the most complex development issues and scenarios including:

crowdsourcing and open access to data as citizen accessories for urban development

transparency models for participation and interaction with policy making in government

resource management, health care and open education methodologies

increased digital mobility networking and communication for freer expression and cultural diversity

new forms of citizen-based, community or device journalism, incl. SMS, radio, data streaming

creating new economies and user-based technologies informed by local knowledge

enabling open peer to peer education formats complementing traditional learning structures

The essential characteristic of the Open Source model is one of sustainability. As economically and politically powerful tools, Open Source technologies, mobile platforms and collaborative data sourcing methodologies now have the ability to be implemented as viable alternatives to tried and often failed attempts at nation building, urban and social development. Given the rise of user generated tools, content and technologies, the world's Open Source communities are in a unique position to strengthen the basic tenets of free and open expression, investing in the boundless potentials of media literacy, community development and individual enterprise.

          urbanism and I left the tons made yalla                                last year to basically fuse ideas                                related to open cultures open                                technologies media architecture and                                urbanism and so what I'd like to share                                with you today is a project which is                                very much at its beginning its in its in                                its infancy and its project for which I                                would like to have also your input and                                hopefully at a certain point also your                                your participation some of the people                                who are involved in the project in one                                way or another are also here so                                Geraldine thanks that that you could you                                could make it                                and and Georgia over here somewhere                                yeah the project is called OS Juba OS                                Juba stands for open source city Juba                                basically open source capital city Juba                                and this this first image here is just                                the piece of propaganda that we had for                                a first brainstorming on this idea back                                in June at the supermarket on unpunched                                gossip the the idea evolved                                through a number of discussions that I                                had with people like Klaus Glenn vinkle                                who's the the head of an organization                                called micked mi CT that's median                                cooperation and transition mi CT has                                been working in Sudan and South Sudan                                for very many years basically training                                journalists independent journalists                                independent media they work in crisis                                and post crisis regions to basically                                promote free free expression and we had                                this discussion about open source and                                the role their open source plays in the                                whole development industry let's say                                International Development and what the                                possibilities applause abilities could                                be for an open source model to be used                                in helping to create the the contours of                                this new state South Sudan so this this                                event in June open sourcing or the world                                asking the question is this the world's                                first open source city could it be was                                very much this question about how open                                source and post-conflict development                                could work it was                                [Music]                                somehow my computer has slowed down                                anyways the event gathered together a                                number of people from Berlin's open                                source and strategic media communities                                but also people from international open                                source organizations such as Ushahidi in                                Nairobi as well as from the Hanff                                organization in Indonesia German Federal                                Government was there and some larger                                so-called donor organizations so all of                                a sudden it was clear that there is some                                kind of an interest in actually                                discussing the subject which for a lot                                of us here is somehow pretty                                straightforward I mean it's kind of kind                                of obvious I don't need to you know                                spend too much time on why the open                                source model is perhaps a good one but                                just not the the basic understanding of                                what open source is what open                                technologies are that's moving into also                                the realm of open data and open hardware                                is something which is hardly discussed                                in the real world of international                                development and                                mr.                                [Music]                                we have the strange                                                     was all working so here we are now today                                at the summit of new thinking which is                                about open open strategies and the                                project has come to the point now that                                we've been invited to go to Juba in                                December to have a first meeting with                                the government of South Sudan with                                players in the in the field of                                international development in Juba as                                 well as civil society leaders in in Juba                                 and basically were we're designing this                                 project right now as we speak and that's                                 of course one of the reasons to be here                                 today it's what what that could be so I                                 just give a little bit of background to                                 South Sudan and and to to Juba South                                 Sudan is a relatively large country that                                 became independent in                                                  off from Sudan so what is now I guess                                 the northern part the rump Sudan after                                 about                                                                   a country that is facing of course                                 massive challenges it faces the                                 challenges of its own economic                                 development issues of poverty of course                                 issues of education but it also has the                                 challenge of defining itself in the                                 international context very few people                                 know about this state about this country                                 and there is no clear unifying cultural                                 identity in the state it's it's it's a                                 it's a multi multi-ethnic multicultural                                 state made up of ten ten different                                 provinces which all has a very distinct                                 cultural cultural identity and it's in                                 the statistics                                 some of the things which is interesting                                 for us as we start to research this                                 project is that a good three quarters of                                 the population is under                                             about a quarter of the population is                                 actually literate and of course of that                                 quarter of that of that number the vast                                 majority are males so there's a scenario                                 also of incredibly low literacy rates                                 amongst women and girls and this                                 presents also some some interesting                                 challenges but also a lot of                                 opportunities for doing things in in a                                 different in a different kind of way do                                 by itself the capital was was chosen                                 amongst a number of small regional                                 capitals in the southern part of Sudan                                 it's a city which has grown enormously                                 it was the fastest growing urban center                                 in the world in between                                               basically it had to go from being this                                 little dusty capital to the capital of a                                 new new country and Juba today is                                 somewhere in between all these things so                                 it's between this this sort of dusty                                 provincial place and a place that wants                                 to be capital of this this new country                                 and these changes which are going on in                                 Juba in the urban and architectural                                 sense are happening at an outrageously                                 fast pace as part of the development of                                 the project I had the opportunity to go                                 there a few weeks ago and the                                 the contrasts and the scenarios in this                                 city were we're also very interesting so                                 I just show a couple of quick images                                 from that is a typical typical street                                 scene in the middle of Juba so primarily                                 residential area and you've got the the                                 small-scale let's say typical South                                 Sudanese houses and then these villas                                 that have been built for a large part by                                 the South Sudanese diaspora who has been                                 coming back or has come back to South                                 Sudan most of the streets are not paved                                 there's a few a few streets that are                                 sort of main thorough ways through the                                 city which are paved and almost all the                                 new architecture or almost all the new                                 building anyways which is being done in                                 Juba and across South Sudan is it's                                 being done with shipping containers that                                 have been adapted so there's there's                                 there's fancy ones that are already like                                 set up as as offices and basically the                                 whole city is in accumulation an                                 aggregate various ways of building with                                 containers so there's some quite cute                                 little cottage II examples like this one                                 down here this is actually on the campus                                 of the University of Juba and this is a                                 restaurant which is made up of of those                                 containers stacked up but it's been                                 sheathed in in in bamboo sticks so to                                 give it sort of like the shine or the                                 appearance of something completely                                 different so there's very creative ways                                 of dealing with this kind of scenario                                 and it's also in itself a very kind of                                 open and modular kind of situation but                                 the city is booming there's this new                                 construction going up all over the place                                 nobody knows exactly for what this sort                                 of like unnamed buildings a lot of                                 office buildings happening there's                                 the the the kind of thing that one sees                                 in these in these rapid development                                 contexts of the resolution here is not                                 so okay no okay                                 okay well this I just wanted to show                                 this this ad here but we can't really                                 see it it's it's about the future so                                 everything is about looking into the                                 future about the the power of beer for                                 the future there's this huge                                 advertisements in the city and there's                                 there's a huge mixture of informal and                                 formal structures happening in this in                                 this place as I said it's the now the                                 largest urban center in South Sudan                                 about ten years ago there was a                                 population of about well less than                                                                                                       this transition from a tiny provincial                                 hub with limited infrastructure and                                 services to the world to the to being                                 servicing for world's capitals perhaps                                 the greatest single challenge that the                                 city itself has so where the project                                 began as an idea about open source                                 urbanism we were primarily interested in                                 in the functions of this city as a                                 capital city so of course a different                                 kind of scenario then a regular urban                                 center a capital city has to provide the                                 framework also for the state to function                                 and within these scenarios of frameworks                                 for a state to function you start                                 looking at urbanism actually as a as a                                 as a function of state building itself                                 so the project is in a phase right now                                 of actually looking at much larger                                 picture of the way in which open source                                 can actually function with the kernel of                                 a capital city as a framework building                                 thing for the whole for the whole state                                 so we start looking at methodologies at                                 processes and the very kinds of                                 structures and let's say the the forms                                 of sustainability and the forms of                                 collaborative enterprise that exists                                 with an open source as a function for                                 state building the the models which we                                 are used to let's say in the West or in                                 Europe about open source the ribbon ism                                 which are like super high-tech models of                                 data efficiency and traffic control and                                 all that kind of stuff as not at all the                                 kinds of things that we are talking                                 about in Juba or within the the project                                 for for South Sudan we're looking really                                 very much at the ideas that are behind                                 open source and how these can be adapted                                 and adopted in other contexts of                                 transformation and implementation of new                                 forms of methodologies it's also very                                 much in the in the spirit of creative                                 hacktivism                                 this statement from Richard M Stallman                                 that hack hacking is about clay playful                                 cleverness so not about breaking or                                 destroying but really about creating                                 something new out of things that have                                 been broken open is is is fundamental                                 and it's also a lot about enabling                                 access access to information access to                                 data access to technologies in all                                 realms of of society and inter interplay                                 between let's say the government and and                                 the public so the project is is dealing                                 at its core right now with how to define                                 and how to structure situations of open                                 data open knowledge and basically public                                 domain info so that the people who are                                 actually building a livelihood that are                                 trying to use the I guess the euphoria                                 that independence brought how can they                                 use this material that's in the public                                 domain to actually create livelihoods                                 without absolutely having to rely just                                 on donor countries on donor                                 organizations or at least how can one                                 create a form of collaboration that                                 actually is sustainable so that these                                 kinds of open structures can can be used                                 so this is very much about creating                                 spaces spaces of exchange spaces for                                 collaboration for sustainability it's                                 very much about creating scenarios in                                 which there is accountability and                                 transparency and also participation in                                 the public process South Sudan is                                 ostensibly a a democracy they have had                                 relatively free and fair and and                                 violence free elections but there's no                                 real understanding about how that whole                                 system how that structure works or why                                 it should even be used and there are                                 elements within the government who kind                                 of want to keep it that way                                 you know we'd rather not let people know                                 like how these things should be working                                 but there are elements in the government                                 that actually want openness and                                 accountability because they recognize                                 that that that contract let's say                                 between government and civil society is                                 essential in order to secure the future                                 of the country and not end up being a                                 failed state so there's there's enormous                                 potential to enable various forms of                                 opportunity we just need to find the                                 mechanisms to do that and to find the                                 right partners within South Sudan within                                 the government for that as well how are                                 we doing with with time just cuz yeah                                 just let me know when we're like five                                 minutes before ok there's some there's a                                 number of organizations in Africa                                 primarily who who are dealing with these                                 concepts who are working with these                                 concepts in I guess one could say                                 innovative and very forward-thinking and                                 collaborative means there's there's the                                 whole as a network of so-called AI hubs                                 so innovation and technology hubs often                                 focused at or focused towards youth and                                 getting youth involved in very hands-on                                 ways with technology there's also the                                 project called I sadhus which is itself                                 just a node within a larger so-called                                 ice network I standing for innovation                                 collaboration and entrepreneurship the                                 ice Addis hub in in Addis Ababa in                                 Ethiopia is working together with the                                 University of Juba to to set up one of                                 these innovation collaboration and                                 entrepreneurship nodes in Juba and and                                 this is also very much a part of the                                 project very important is this is the                                 collaboration also mentioned earlier                                 between the Diaspora and the people who                                 have been living and working and                                 surviving in South Sudan for the past                                                                                                       friction between let's say all the                                 Sudanese the South Sudanese who had                                 lived outside the country coming back at                                 the time of Independence and sort of                                 telling everybody else this is this is                                 the way it should be done a lot of                                 resistance to that this resistance has                                 been turning more and more into actual                                 useful collaboration in the past months                                 or maybe in the in the past year the                                 first year of Independence and South                                 Sudan has started to set up embassies                                 around the world and we're very lucky                                 here in Berlin to have one of the very                                 few females ambassadors from South Sudan                                 satola Abdullah Osman she's one of those                                 people who also has great vision for the                                 country she herself has been working for                                 many decades in in in the realm of                                 creating                                 opportunity and education to help solve                                 the problem of primarily female                                 illiteracy and the project is very much                                 tied in to the work that people are                                 doing outside of the country like                                 Ambassador Sedona here in Berlin                                 together with the actual government in                                 South Sudan at the same at the same time                                 South Sudan is also starting to draft                                 bills which will allow hopefully certain                                 forms of open structures open access                                 access to information to actually happen                                 there's right now a draft bill for the                                 right of access to information there's                                 also a media bill which is meant to                                 regulate the media which we're not quite                                 sure yet if that's actually a good thing                                 or a bad thing but at least it's it's an                                 attempt to set up rules at which clear                                 distinctions can be made so that the                                 problem of of the police or the                                 government just kind of shutting you                                 down for no reason whatsoever should be                                 should be eliminated whether that works                                 or not is another thing but what's                                 interesting is that in this in the                                 discussions that are taking place in                                 South Sudan about for example the right                                 to access there is very little                                 connection to what to do when you have                                 access to information so again we we                                 land directly in the scenario of we've                                 been given legislation to access                                 information but we don't talk about open                                 data or what open information is                                 available and how it can be used                                 [Music]                                 so one of the the partners in the                                 project OSHA he D which is a software                                 company based in in Nairobi they've been                                 very active in Africa and around the                                 world in in in terms of also providing                                 very straightforward examples of what                                 citizens can do with with their own data                                 and with available data they're their                                 primary I guess product our crowd crowd                                 sourcing platforms so let's say                                 statistical analysis that can be graphed                                 to show certain kinds of trends they do                                 election monitoring they do crisis                                 management but they also have projects                                 that that anybody can can use there's                                 one about kids and or people in Serbia                                 following sort of like who has guns and                                 who doesn't so it's a huge range of                                 things and                                 yeah we'll move on from there because                                 then we get into a whole other area                                 which we don't have time for you have so                                 changing the way information flows in                                 the world that's their that's their                                 headliner of course Ubuntu is also                                 fundamentally important just as an                                 example one one of many many open-source                                 solutions or platforms or software's                                 because we find also scenarios that                                 organizations are operating with let's                                 say proprietary software completely                                 unlicensed one could say illegal so are                                 there alternatives to that kind of                                 scenario that then also save money you                                 know in a place that has to be more                                 effective let's say with the money that                                 they have or don't have                                 for this organizations like the free                                 software and open-source foundation for                                 Africa are incredibly important phosphor                                 this is very strong network within                                 Africa that has chapters and just about                                 every country every location in Africa                                 not yet in in South Sudan and these                                 kinds of organizations are important                                 because they provide a kind of a peer                                 structure so when you talk to people in                                 South Sudan in the government about                                 ideas behind open source and open data                                 open systems often there's there's a                                 fear there's a fear of the open a fear                                 of being let's say of having people peer                                 into closely to what you're actually                                 doing without actually realizing that                                 these kinds of mechanisms and the                                 material the materiality that is being                                 worked with is actually already part of                                 the public domain or actually belongs to                                 the citizens that should be using it so                                 organizations like the free the like                                 fossa they they provide this kind of                                 peer structure so that also governments                                 can discuss these pro these problems                                 that are much higher a much higher level                                 there are organizations again this is                                 one based here in Berlin but operating                                 internationally which are also                                 interesting elements within a project                                 like this for free South Sudan called                                 open oil open oil is it's basically a                                 consultancy which is looking at and                                 developing I guess you could call it                                 solutions for how to open up the oil                                 industry a lot of the problems that                                 exist within oil based economies or                                 strong resource-based economy's is for                                 example there's absolutely no                                 transparency between the con the the                                 level of where the contracts are and                                 where the money is going what it's being                                 used for in a state like South Sudan                                 which ostensibly gets                                                   revenue from oil not knowing what the                                 contract says about the oil is it's kind                                 of a you know it's a serious serious                                 problem it's a serious issue so open oil                                 which has just released the South Sudan                                 oil Almanac is an organization which is                                 basically working that also I suppose                                 through peer pressure and outside                                 pressure to make these contracts open so                                 that for example the finance minister                                 even might know what kind of income is                                 being generated in the country because                                 if the finance minister doesn't get the                                 material or the information coming from                                 the contracts which is often the case he                                 also can't or she also can't plan for                                 the development of of the country there                                 are a number of other projects as very                                 many this is one one example coming from                                 a participant who will be in in Juba in                                 December or Gainey Otis le he's a                                 Mexican based artists                                 - programmer and creative hacker he has                                 for example a software called Ojo or oil                                 Vaz which is an Android platform open                                 source software for sending images and                                 voice messages from your telephone to                                 the web it's fairly straightforward idea                                 but the point is that he's developing                                 this software very specifically for                                 let's say lowest threshold technology                                 use in scenarios where access to                                 technology is limited but the necessity                                 to share information to share data is                                 extremely high so his project hsiao-tieh                                 Baku Lima the voice of the farmers is                                 one of these projects happening in                                 Tanzania where farmers in a certain                                 district or in a province are on a                                 regular basis recording images stories                                 interviews videos and so on                                 about the effects of climate change on                                 their crops this is of course a big                                 issue there's the one discussion that                                 says there is no real climate change                                 happening and of course there's the                                 people on the ground who actually do see                                 these changes from season to season so                                 how do you how do you create an                                 empirical scenario for for tracking                                 those changes for example and how do you                                 discuss and exchange information about                                 it so this that's what this this project                                 is about and it's a project that was                                 also started off with funding by various                                 agencies and so on but is now running                                 completely independently so it has found                                 that balance between use of technology                                 the minimally available resources and                                 the need for that technology to actually                                 function on its own so it's no longer                                 just let's say a product                                 International funding organizations but                                 it but it has found a use within the                                 community and with the with the farmers                                 who are who are using it you can also                                 download it yourself if you can scan                                 this or just Google Oh Joe or you was if                                 you want to try it out another very                                 interesting project organization or                                 network is the group behind open source                                 ecology they're working let's say on the                                 open hardware side of things open source                                 ecology also deals primarily with the                                 agricultural sector but not just and                                 basically what they're doing is they're                                 building machines that are based                                 completely on open source plans they're                                 their goal I suppose is to create the so                                 called global village Construction Set                                 and as a practical example they have for                                 example a system for an open source                                 tractor the plans for this tractor are                                 freely available they can be downloaded                                 printed as one wishes and the pieces the                                 materials for building this tractor are                                 elements which are found in most if not                                 all places around the world they can be                                 built out of local materials they can be                                 built in such a way that lets say spin                                 off economies can be built for the                                 procurement and the servicing of these                                 machines it also means that the tractor                                 which is built in India looks completely                                 different from the one that is maybe                                 being built in Kenya which is different                                 than the one that's being built in the                                 States the point is that all the                                 tractors actually function and they can                                 be built in in in in in                                 in a in certain cases at least in a much                                 faster way than a normal procurement                                 scenario is happening where for example                                 shipment of of tractors is being bought                                 from China or the states or even Germany                                 and they arrive and the first time they                                 break down you don't have the right                                 parts for them and the thing won't work                                 anymore and they end up on the on the                                 scrap heap                                 so again it's an example of a form of                                 sustainability within this open-source                                 context so this is a graph about that                                 but how are we doing with time we're                                 kind of at the end okay then I will just                                 I will zip I will zip through this and                                 I'll just wrap up because I would like                                 to have your your comments just going                                 back to the actual process so the actual                                 structure in the in the urban context of                                 the OS to but project there's there's                                 there's three very simple and very                                 straightforward ideals these were out                                 these particular ones were outlined by                                 the peer-to-peer foundation and that is                                 the requirement of input by all                                 stakeholders and effective citizens                                 including outsiders with innovative                                 ideas this is important because often                                 these processes of development happen in                                 very closed environments there's the                                 requirement of participatory governance                                 and decision-making for the final                                 outcome and the requirement that this                                 accumulated knowledge be put in the                                 knowledge Commons for future use and                                 remix in other projects so these are                                 three very fundamental rules or at least                                 scenarios that can be adapted also for                                 education projects it can be adapted in                                 accumulating information about                                 healthcare and health systems it's just                                 a kind of a straightforward guide from                                 which one can                                 create other forms of let's say                                 sustainable and open development so                                 we're right in the middle of preparing                                 this this event the first event which is                                 going to be around this issue of                                 so-called open knowledge and sustainable                                 development will be in Juba in South                                 Sudan from the                                                     December it's it's in collaboration with                                 this organization M ICT which I                                 mentioned at the beginning their part is                                 going to be very much about how open                                 structures can support the independent                                 media the development of independent                                 media the other side of the event is                                 going to be very much about how the                                 reality of this open-source model can                                 actually function in the States so can                                 this actually be done can we really                                 create this open-source model as a state                                 structure we have some very interesting                                 people coming Dorothy Gordon for example                                 she considers herself a liberation                                 technologist committed to ensuring that                                 Africa has the capacity create and                                 implement ICT solutions for sustainable                                 human development and these guests are                                 coming together with experts and actors                                 working in in South Sudan in Juba in                                 setting up this scenario for for a new                                 state and if we can do it using an                                 open-source model then we're really                                 super happy so that's it for this very                                 very quick fly through I appreciate your                                 your your patience and if you'd like to                                 get in touch with me that's my name my                                 email address and my my Twitter account                                 I'm here we're here in our small team I                                 would really love to have your input for                                 the continuation of the project also                                 within the the event that we will be                                 doing in in Juba I'm hoping that we'll                                 have some interesting and structured                                 feedback sessions early next year when                                 we get back so questions statements                                 please it's open to you                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]                                 and if so there's one guy can you come                                 up and get a mic because there's this                                 this incredible sort of like a wall of                                 silence here thank you for your talk                                 this is a really inspiring project I'm                                 just curious                                 one of the challenges that open                                 governance is faced when it's been tried                                 in other places like the United States                                 can you hear me yeah speaking of the mic                                 but talk loud as well I'm sorry yeah one                                 of the challenges that open governance                                 has faced in other places or it's been                                 tried like in the United States for                                 example is that transparency can                                 sometimes expose problems or even in                                 some cases corruption but often we lack                                 the means to actually take meaningful                                 action to correct them so I'm just                                 wondering if you've kind of anticipated                                 this this challenge and and how you                                 might address it well this is this is                                 actually what I meant you know by that                                 fear factor you know at that on the one                                 hand of course it depends on which                                 official you talk to I mean some                                 actually do want to use these scenarios                                 for for eliminating corruption for                                 uncovering corruption others don't                                 really want to talk about that but they                                 they like the idea of providing data in                                 as efficient a way as possible so that                                 people can use it for economic                                 development for example so I don't have                                 like a real clear you know a solution                                 really but how to deal with that fear                                 factor other than just going with let's                                 say the best case examples and positive                                 scenarios of course the the issues in                                 the states are very different than they                                 are here and in Europe and and of course                                 somewhat different also than in South                                 Sudan but one of the one of the more                                 interesting I guess organizations or                                 networks is the the open government                                 partnership of which some African                                 countries like Tanzania Kenya South                                 Africa                                 our leaders in and the open government                                 partnership is again I guess one of                                 these kind of global peer pressure                                 groups that you can actually on a policy                                 level in a government level talk about                                 the positive elements of open data and                                 open government without let's say                                 worrying about what will happen if mmm                                 the embarrassing stuff gets out because                                 you can see that in Tanzania it's                                 actually working and in Kenya it's                                 actually working so it's important to                                 basically also have that dialogue                                 started so even the the discussion that                                 the very basic discussion itself has to                                 be has to be opened up and and just sort                                 of dealing basically with that fear that                                 fear factor is the biggest biggest                                 challenge probably                                 okay so I'm around I think we probably                                 have to get on to the next speaker so                                 again thanks and thanks to the                                 organizers as well for letting me do                                 this chiz                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]
