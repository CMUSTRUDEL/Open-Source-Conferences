Description: 
	Full title: "Open Empowerment - A method to train, push and hack citizen powered projects"

Open State is a series of events starting in Autumn 2013. We will explore, develop and support innovative projects that work on the future we urgently need. And everything will be open-sourced. We'll prototype the smallest cell of a sustainable society and create blueprints for everyone to adopt. Small and mid-sized groups of people can pick these step-by-step manuals from a web platform, free to use, share and rework. Until 2015 we'll promote 100 projects through continued Open State events and aim to empower thousands of local adaptors worldwide.
