Publication date: 2020-02-21
Playlist: Summit of Newthinking #SON12
Description: 
	Collaborative consumption is a fairly new term coined by author Rachel Botsman. It describes a shift away from ownership towards emphasizing access. It includes new business models such as car-sharing, sharing of apartments, experiences and skills, just to name some examples. Essentially, collaborative consumption is about sharing and being open; the user opens up a part of his life, resources and belongings to others in a way that benefits both parties and society as a whole.
