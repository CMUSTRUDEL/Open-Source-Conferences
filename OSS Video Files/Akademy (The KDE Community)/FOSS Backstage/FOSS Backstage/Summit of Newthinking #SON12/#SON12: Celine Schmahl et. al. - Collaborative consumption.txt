Title: #SON12: Celine Schmahl et. al. - Collaborative consumption
Publication date: 2020-02-21
Playlist: Summit of Newthinking #SON12
Description: 
	Collaborative consumption is a fairly new term coined by author Rachel Botsman. It describes a shift away from ownership towards emphasizing access. It includes new business models such as car-sharing, sharing of apartments, experiences and skills, just to name some examples. Essentially, collaborative consumption is about sharing and being open; the user opens up a part of his life, resources and belongings to others in a way that benefits both parties and society as a whole.

	                              [Music]                               this is a panel on collaborative                               consumption so if this is why you're                               here just do a big interval just maybe                               two words on consumption is I'll do a                               quick intro of our speakers and then                               we'll dive right in and we'll have time                               for questions afterwards                               so collaborative consumption is as a                                term that was coined probably in the                                    but really championed by Rachel Botsman                                in her book what's mine is yours and                                it's basically about sharing goods and                                services with other people basically we                                have some of the companies that I would                                name as examples of collaborative                                consumption here today such as Airbnb                                car or ride-sharing companies such as                                sip car in the US or drive now in                                Germany or get C to name another example                                I my name is Celine and I'm co-founder                                of capaco which is a task swapping                                platform so we're also in that space so                                let me do a quick intro of the speakers                                we have Heiner to my to my left                                who's community manager at Airbnb in                                Germany I don't think I need to explain                                what Airbnb does then we have Joe who's                                a co-founder of desk wanted a platform                                for basically booking desks in                                co-working spaces we have Katie who's                                the community manager at get see a                                platform to book experiences and finally                                dan co-founder at kinder Faye which                                allows parents to find childcare so                                let's just get started you have a mic so                                I just did a very quick intro but maybe                                you can explain a bit more in depth what                                collaborative consumptions all about for                                you just whoever wants to                                yeah can you                                hello it's working okay hey I'm ready                                a minor freaking solution is to get                                access to staff you don't basically own                                so like Airbnb we you get access to                                rooms recommendations                                you usually couldn't get access to so                                you can book a very nice apartment in                                Cisco or you can just for me having it                                for me was that product these are what                                it should be allows you to do whatever                                it is that you do and offer it to                                somebody else                                of course it's actually a reverse                                regression to an earlier kind of market                                that we used to have which was a really                                simple one-time market that's what makes                                it unique and new yeah so hi I'm Katie I                                look at kids II yeah I think I agree                                with what everyone said I don't think                                many of us are gonna disagree with each                                other but just touching on what Joel                                said for kids II where a place where you                                can book and offer experiences and I                                think what he said about challenging                                more like traditional ways of offering                                something kids II definitely does that                                in I guess the experience                                marketplace so for example I don't know                                more traditional ways to book tours or                                experiences now gibbsy makes it easy for                                anybody to be a local guide or to offer                                an experience and anybody can find these                                rather than sort of having to find maybe                                randoms when you're on vacation it makes                                it a lot easier and a lot more                                trustworthy and then I also think that                                it collaborative consumption now really                                enables I guess new ways of creating                                community to online you're meeting new                                people having real experiences together                                sharing things with people that I guess                                in the old model used to be your                                neighbors and people that you knew from                                your your your communities now it's                                online yeah hey guys my name is Don for                                me I mean yeah the the definition is                                pretty clear it's sharing something that                                already exists so instead of buying                                something you share something and that's                                Katie said in the past maybe you used to                                know your neighbor a lot better four                                years ago you knew all your neighbors                                and you chair there saw you go over for                                the drills and now you just don't know                                your neighbors anymore so you need an                                online platform to to share and                                obviously that makes the market a lot                                more liquid all of a sudden in your                                 street is definitely someone that has a                                 saw even if none of the people in your                                 house has one and Atkin if it's not so                                 much about sharing goods it's more about                                 sharing connections so we're an online                                 marketplace for child care and what that                                 means is once we are on the one hand we                                 have a big community of child care                                 givers so that's nannies and babysitters                                 and on the other hand we have parents                                 but every parent that joined the                                 community brings their child care givers                                 so everyone brings their favorite                                 babysitters so instead of having access                                 to only your limited set of of                                 caregivers you now have access to all of                                 your friends caregivers as well                                 do you want to add something or okay                                 there there are very different platforms                                 that are kind of in this space of                                 collaborative consumption I mean for                                 example for there's a big difference                                 obviously between car sharing and and it                                 gets it for example your big experiences                                 so if if these companies all belong in                                 the same space what are kind of the                                 common denominators and what are the                                 motivations for people to engage in such                                 different services I think the the real                                 similarities are the way that the                                 platform works it's that it's a                                 marketplace that makes people find other                                 people with similar interests and sort                                 of one person has something the other                                 one person needs that so whether it's a                                 car where it's the flat that free                                 whether it's a babysitter whether it's                                 someone that books at or this sort of                                 mechanics are the same and the same                                 problems exist so how do you make the                                 marketplace liquid how do you make sure                                 everyone can find someone that's really                                 of interest to them how do you make sure                                 the people on the platform are transfer                                 fee and actually deliver the service                                 they promised so I think all four of us                                 have that exact same problem despite                                 having even completely different sectors                                 of the economy                                 sharing my car my apartment my                                 babysitter or whatever that's a lot of                                 sharing where is this kind of going do                                 you think that people will completely                                 let go of possessions is there is there                                 a way in the middle or yeah what's your                                 view on that well I think for sharing                                 there always have to be people who own                                 stuff there there has to be people who                                 own cars there has to be people who own                                 flats to share it so I don't think that                                 everybody gonna not own anything it's                                 just like everybody is I think pretty                                 much everybody will share something not                                 not everything like for me I never have                                 a car never had to and I never will but                                 I always gonna have my own apartment                                 because I want to feel home every piece                                 is kind of like home and you can feel at                                 home there but still I want the place so                                 I'm singing alright I think that people                                 will always have stuff and there has to                                 be people who own stuff so it's not                                 going to go all the way that everybody                                 is sharing everything                                 [Music]                                 to use the network willing to and yeah I                                 I don't think that idea the idea of                                 position has been around for such a long                                 time I don't have the feeling that the                                 Internet's gonna change that I don't                                 know if you know about every bee and                                 Junie did a study is a summer that                                 proved that it's not just a trend like                                 such in the US people in Germany really                                 do it because it's the way they st.                                 changed people now don't want to own                                 stuff they happy with having access to                                 stuff and we proved that so it's gonna                                 go more we're gonna start chain sharing                                 more but it's not gonna be that                                 everybody shares there's still gonna be                                 some people who are totally rich and                                 just do it because they can save time or                                 can save a little bit money to just                                 focus on their own stuff but their start                                 they're gonna be people who start                                 thinking that they're gonna save the                                 environment they're gonna helps                                 environment so I'm thinking or I know                                 that people right now kind of share more                                 because they know they're gonna do                                 something good for the environment but                                 it's not gonna be that everybody gonna                                 do it seeing currently that's the method                                 that is going to be done you're going to                                 see every type of potential transaction                                 that's done currently in the real world                                 on a physical basis is going to be                                 transferred eventually to the digital                                 world and the most common platform is                                 going to be used is one that lets you                                 know who the other person is I let you                                 interact with them on a very intimate                                 level so I see the whole thing being                                 broadened out to every type of                                 interaction and every type of                                 transaction imaginable and all the time                                 I hear about little ways in which                                 concepts which you would think are just                                 we often are being digitized and it's                                 just never gonna ended you'll never be                                 cease to be amazed at how someone is                                 thought to capture a certain interaction                                 in an online platform and we're only                                 gonna see more and more of that and so I                                 really think that we're just at the                                 start and I guess even within the space                                 that we're talking about like talking                                 about the transactions we already do                                 online in these collaborative models I'm                                 already starting to see a lot of                                 diversity between all the different                                 models and platforms so for instance                                 within the online accommodation platform                                 of course Airbnb is a you know the main                                 the main one that everyone recognizes                                 but under that we're also starting to                                 see the splintering of little like niche                                 groups of people who share their flats                                 and apartments in different ways you                                 know there's one called startup stay                                 which is for entrepreneurs who want to                                 share their flats together and Willy if                                 you can get that niche already how much                                 further is it going to go we're going to                                 start seeing every type of small                                 community be able to interact on a                                 really intimate level so I think that                                 what we're looking at right now is                                 really just the the very beginning of it                                 so you would say towards a kind of a                                 hyper fragmented market of collaborative                                 consumption platforms Anish for                                 everything basically it could be but as                                 we also know in the digital world                                 digital markets tend to trend towards                                 monopolies and so it does make it                                 difficult and so you might see so many                                 small platforms kind of shoot up and                                 then maybe die away                                 collaborative consumption platform                                 actually works a lot of them fail a lot                                 of them don't find a viable business                                 model and they disappear after a couple                                 of months of you know everyone getting                                 excited about the idea of swapping this                                 one thing that we never consider we                                 could have swap but keep going to try                                 and one of them's going to stick                                 eventually and they will they will you                                 know go on and continue                                 you kind of touched upon that a little                                 bit but um so the internet kind of                                 enabled this whole Renaissance of                                 sharing if you want what is what is the                                 role of mobile in this in the future of                                 collaborative consumption ninety-five                                 percent of revenues and we think that in                                 something like twelve or eighteen months                                 time about ninety five percent of our                                 revenue will be on mobile because the                                 disassembly is so convenient of course                                 for assets it's a little bit different                                 from from guilty because or even that                                 squandered because whereas you typically                                 book the same caregiver so what uber is                                 done or what my tax you have done is                                 that it's just so convenient to do it                                 over I mean if you were booking a                                 holiday I don't know if that's a or if                                 you're looking for an office space for                                 your company I don't know if that's                                 something you do on the fly while you're                                 sitting in the you don't have a platform                                 can be you can be real interaction it                                 can be location-based I mean there's                                 just so much new opportunity and and I                                 think the the sort of the way                                 collaborative consumption online is                                 today is really just a start I mean you                                 see if someone has an idea why couldn't                                 we share this why can we do this                                 together and and if you see what were                                 four completely different sectors of the                                 economy and there's so much room in                                 between our companies that I'm sure                                 there's so much more to come whatever                                 you some drivers and obstacles of                                 collaborative consumption I think it's                                 it's people who get turned on to the                                 idea right like of sharing and and and                                 sharing experiences and sharing flats                                 and sharing desks and and and                                 interacting with these new communities                                 that hadn't existed before I think                                 that's probably one of the biggest                                 obstacles and I think                                 that it just it's possible that people                                 will obviously like it it works it's                                 proven to work but it depends on your                                 niche so forgive me I guess it's just                                 turning people on to the idea that                                 there's a place where you can go up your                                 bird and you want to find something to                                 do you can go online and there's really                                 cool stuff that you wouldn't normally                                 find and I think that I mean the same                                 thing for a finding childcare like you                                 wouldn't necessarily know that there's                                 website for this people go I don't know                                 Craigslist or something or call their                                 friends and the same desk wanted and I                                 think that it requires a lot of social                                 proof probably to get people onto the                                 idea like my friends are doing it or                                 this person is doing it or it's in the                                 media so maybe I'll give it a try I                                 think that's probably the biggest                                 challenge is getting this information                                 out there and then having enough weight                                 behind it that people are like oh yeah                                 this is kind of awesome maybe I'll try                                 it for myself and the driver I mean I                                 think we're just we have so much stuff                                 and I think we're in a lot of trouble                                 just a society like we have all this                                 crap and so now I guess like the                                 opportunity is to is to find a way to                                 make it so much more sustainable you                                 know whatever save the environment share                                 a desk or share a car or something or                                 yeah I don't know or share your saw like                                 this is the these drivers are there I                                 think you just have to kind of be turned                                 on to the fact that there are                                 communities out there for people that                                 really want to participate in these sort                                 of yeah things I see some obstacles and                                 I guess two different categories one is                                 to do with the comfort level that people                                 have and addressing that and also then                                 to do with the regulation of these                                 things so to do it the way that people                                 actually approach these services I still                                 think there needs to be some development                                 in products to do with things like                                 insurance and personal what's the word                                 reputation so if people really feel that                                 they are comfortable doing their I mean                                 we're all well used now to doing to                                 sharing a flat or something like that                                 but as these these platforms develop                                 we're going to be getting more and more                                 intrusive into areas that we haven't                                 perhaps considered that we may let other                                 people in and we'll need to find ways to                                 feel more comfortable about that I mean                                 really basic level for instance a desk                                 wanted where you want to encourage every                                 single office to become a shared office                                 so we think every office in the world                                 can somehow be shared just in the way                                 that co-working spaces are shared                                 workspaces so our mission is to tell                                 people who run offices that you should                                 accept strangers to come into your                                 office now you'd think that was                                 something like air B&B out there that                                 wouldn't already be that hard but it                                 still it's you know it still is                                 difficult to convince people that that                                 your space your workplace is something                                 some way you can invite a stranger into                                 and I've had a lot of people request                                 some really bizarre kind of insurance                                 products or things that they would want                                 to have attached to our platform before                                 they feel comfortable about it or some                                 kind of verification process of who the                                 people are and I thought all those                                 things were already there in place you                                 know you can see who they are you can                                 see the Facebook connections you can see                                 they look but there's still there's                                 still a degree of comfort that people                                 need to overcome and I think                                 particularly in the corporate sphere so                                 okay on the personal level we're all                                 pretty comfortable with these ideas but                                 when you get start dealing with                                 companies even like small companies                                 suddenly you hit another kind of level                                 of them of intrusiveness and in                                 regulation to to overcome I mean I'm                                 talking mostly about our sphere at desk                                 wanted so that's the kind of one level                                 or the other level of obstacle is                                 regulative so I've spoken about this                                 before but there's a big problem in                                 Germany with the with the agency called                                 Baffin or the financial regulation                                 agency which actually has made it                                 illegal to run the common platforms that                                 we all want to run well not the                                 platforms but the payment mechanisms                                 that we all want to run the kind of                                 mechanism where you pay a platform                                     percent of the cost and then the                                 platform keeps a percentage and then                                 pays the host or whoever's offering the                                 service or the good the remaining                                 whatever                                                                income that's illegal for a german                                 company to do now according to Baffin                                 which makes a huge problem for any                                 startup that's based here that wants to                                 pursue a collaborative consumption model                                 based on that kind of that kind of                                 revenue structure now there are some                                 companies that are trying to address                                 this by doing finding loopholes and                                 basing payments offshore but there's if                                 the German authorities would actually                                 wake up a bit and realize that they're                                 missing the potential for a huge startup                                 growth just because of their regulative                                 practices and their their regulation                                 then it would certainly make things                                 faster especially in Germany the other                                 option is that we'll have to move our                                 companies out of Germany which would be                                 really unfortunate yeah I think the                                 Baffin topic is really annoying for                                 everyone it's technically it's not                                 necessarily illegal but you mean the                                 banking license because you're handling                                 someone else's money there's a couple of                                 loopholes that I guess all of us have in                                 our terms terms and services but it's                                 it's a bit annoying to spend money on                                 the lawyer when you want to spend money                                 on your product but I think that's                                 something that's very specific to                                 Germany I think something that we see                                 that's that's typical for collaborative                                 consumption platforms all around the                                 world or awareness that you said and the                                 other thing what you call something we                                 call the trust so every every platform                                 has trust barriers so for example for                                 others the parents need to trust the                                 babysitter and the babysitter needs to                                 trust the parents and and every sort of                                 collaborative consumption marketplace                                 has that because you're dealing with                                 strangers and warred a and when you get                                 your soul back or will you not get your                                 soul back with your car have a scratch                                 would it not have a scratch what will                                 happen if the car has a strat ascribed                                 so all of these topics are sort of in                                 the process of being solved by a lot of                                 platform then I think at me everyone is                                 solving the problems that is very                                 specific to their niche so we're trying                                 to solve that for childcare car rental                                 platforms are trying to solve that for                                 car rental places and everybody has a                                 huge insurance that they have when when                                 someone breaks your flat but but it's                                 even more fund them at the fundamental                                 and something working because someone's                                 really inside your house so                                 getting back to the question of the                                 drivers the the growth of collaborative                                 consumption also coincides with an                                 economic downturn right and we can                                 observe for example that in some of the                                 southern European countries that are                                 struck by the crisis especially offline                                 solutions are created by the people                                 themselves without making it necessarily                                 a company so what what would what's                                 gonna happen once the economic situation                                 gets better is it is that something that                                 might slow down the growth of                                 collaborative consumption because people                                 will need it less or will it not have an                                 impact I don't think so I don't think                                 that the economic downturn or people                                 having less money as a major driver fuss                                 if you look at the four companies ok                                 maybe having an office spaces may be                                 about saving money but even then it's                                 more about having an experience and                                 being in someone else's office and                                 sharing knowledge I recently read a                                 study about Airbnb that people that stay                                 in San Francisco of Airbnb spend more                                 money on average than people that stay                                 in hotels and and for us babysitting is                                 not about saving money and forget t                                 doing it towards the same so so I really                                 don't think so I think the big driver                                 forces that you don't your offline                                 community as well as you maybe did                                 twenty or thirty years ago and to have a                                 bigger community you know I would agree                                 with definitely with with with                                 co-working and workspace sharing it was                                 something that has been helped along by                                 by the fact that people were suddenly                                 found themselves as freelancers or                                 needed to find someplace to work outside                                 of the traditional office well it's                                 certainly not going to go away if and                                 that's a big if any there's an economic                                 return I mean I don't think there's any                                 you know light on the horizon yet it                                 seems like an endless cycle of crises                                 one after the other so I don't think                                 even so even even if it was the case                                 people already got the idea in their                                 heads that things don't have to be done                                 the old-fashioned way and we can do                                 things differently so I I don't think                                 that's a problem at all                                 I read an article that was entitled                                 collaborative consumption a trend for                                 the young the hip the urban now we kind                                 of touched upon the idea of a trend what                                 about what about the young young and                                 urban part of that statement do you                                 think that collaborative consumption is                                 relief for young and urban people I mean                                 right now that's kind of what we can                                 observe is that going to change its is                                 it a solution that's gonna be for the                                 whole population in a couple of years                                 you can maybe just talk about that I                                 guess it's because it's maybe an online                                 thing and younger people are more I                                 guess willing to accept new things that                                 are happening on the internet especially                                 since the majority of this stuff yeah                                 happening online it's happening on                                 mobile I don't know what you guys                                 demographics are like but mine I I guess                                 get see it's a whole mix of people                                 though it's not just young people that                                 are using kids II it's old people it's                                 it's everybody but I think that I guess                                 there there there whatever that word is                                 pigeonholing I guess at collaborative                                 consumption for being just for the young                                 and urban people it just makes sense                                 because people that live in urban                                 centers that are younger probably have                                 internet access and are probably reading                                 what's going on and maybe you're a                                 little bit more I guess aware of these                                 trends and stuff but that's my guess                                 yeah I think so I think it's more about                                 these are the first users but I don't                                 think that collaborative consumption is                                 about being young I mean my dad loves                                 the Airbnb I don't I don't know what                                 your user demographics are like but my                                 dad loves it a lot of older people I                                 speak to love it as well my a lot of the                                 babysitter's are our platform I retired                                 kindergarten teachers and they love                                 using and it's not a problem for them so                                 so yeah I don't think it's about being                                 young maybe urban obviously when there's                                 more stuff happening closer to where you                                 are in the local marketplace it makes                                 more sense but and what about Geographic                                 impact if your geographic location is                                 collaborative consumption really global                                 phenomenon or all countries made equal                                 in that sense or do you observe                                 differences in the way people approach                                 collaborative consumption how open they                                 are tiered what they are ready to                                 share and whatnot yeah we're only in                                 Germany I guess we've launched in                                 Germany so our communities have sort of                                 it's been like a network effect from                                 where we sort of started and where our                                 own networks are that's sort of the                                 answer like people are really into the                                 idea but I guess what I talked about                                 about social proof and stuff like if                                 there are not really big communities in                                 other areas where people really want to                                 start against a community it's sort of                                 hard to to kickstart something by                                 yourself so it's easy for us to to see                                 people grasping the idea in Germany                                 because we launched here and seen the                                 Amsterdam because their founders are                                 Dutch that kind of thing consumption is                                 about picking barriers that existed so                                 barriers to exchange things or barriers                                 to access things and some of that is a                                 barrier that was existed existed because                                 of a lack of access to be able to                                 interact with people but there are the                                 barriers in other parts of the world                                 that are created by other factors like                                 such as interference or like one company                                 dominating once for you so I would                                 imagine you you should start to see                                 opportunities emerge where people are                                 trying to resist a certain barrier to                                 access one on one interaction or                                 transaction with somebody so it's                                 probably not so much you know of course                                 it's wherever the internet is but that's                                 pretty much everywhere now and so                                 probably you should look for the places                                 where it's difficult to do something                                 with somebody else for whatever reason                                 because you don't know them or because                                 something's in your way so there's no                                 reason why it shouldn't be accessible or                                 effective anywhere where there's a                                 barrier to stopping you actually do the                                 thing that you want to interact with                                 somebody else to do yeah I totally agree                                 I think at the beginning it's easier to                                 do collateral consumption in big cities                                 but pretty much it's possible everywhere                                 you can do it in a village you can do                                 cash in your village so it's not                                 Geographic you can do it everywhere but                                 about Berlin as a city to start a                                 collaborative consumption startup I mean                                 get started in Berlin you folks are all                                 except for you are based in Berlin                                 is there something special about Berlin                                 in that sense any reason why you started                                 care well I'm from Hamburg but I'm I                                 think Berlin is a very special time                                 because it's very international it's                                 very easy it's very hip like you said                                 already it's collaboration might be just                                 for a people but its first art for                                 collecting consumption bonus a very good                                 challenge to start the business to do                                 the majority of working spaces were when                                 we launched in - - so years ago other                                 centers have now emerged but we started                                 here in response to the number of cocky                                 spaces in Berlin so we're very much                                 inspired by what we saw going on in this                                 city and of course all the other trends                                 and make it nice to live here but I                                 think Berlin is in danger of losing that                                 if if it's allowed to continue in the                                 path that we're seeing which is rents                                 increasing ridiculously and and prices                                 going up and that's a lot of the                                 function of the city government I think                                 the city government could do a lot more                                 to make sure that it stays in a football                                 place for some bizarre reason the mayor                                 seems to think that it would be better                                 if the rents were more expensive here he                                 seems to think it would attract a better                                 type of citizenry but he I think he's                                 openly said he wants this to be the new                                 Paris and paying Paris rent prices which                                 if that's the case and you could say                                 goodbye to the entire startup                                 infrastructure which is entirely based                                 on the idea that it's a cheap place to                                 live so I think there could be a lot                                 more done in the way of making sure that                                 rents don't rise too quickly and there's                                 certainly mechanisms if the government                                 already has that it can use to make sure                                 that people don't take huge advantage of                                 rent prices the other potential problem                                 is again in the in the regulation of by                                 Baffin if if bath in the bath an issue                                 isn't sorted out and you know if a                                 decent workaround isn't found and                                 there's the startup ecosystem here you                                 know is also under threat so I think you                                 should think it's take take it for                                 granted that this is always going to be                                 here it's here now because it's cheap                                 and because it's relatively easier and                                 it's make this you know                                 an environment that allows it to happen                                 but but that's always in flux and so you                                 kind of protect it and make sure that it                                 doesn't doesn't swing the other way and                                 turn this into a Paris where you can't                                 do anything hence studio and then they                                 decided to stay in Berlin and they had a                                 big network here as we talked about so                                 it was it just seemed like a logical                                 place to start and I mean we found the                                 community in Berlin is super open to to                                 trying new things and meeting new people                                 and sharing experiences and maybe that's                                 just because the people that I guess                                 we're friends with in our network has                                 made up a lot of expats we're just                                 really curious people and I've only been                                 in Berlin for a year and I found that                                 everyone's just really open and willing                                 to try new stuff so I guess maybe that's                                 why something like is he really works I                                 think Francis not so much about the                                 customers because we have customers it's                                 a great place to exchange ideas so far                                 as the people that run the company it's                                 great to exchange ideas I mean - you                                 know there are other collaborative                                 consumption platforms that you can                                 exchange ideas with that you can meet                                 for a coffee and you can expect with                                 collaborative consumption being a lot                                 about the people people that offer                                 something and the people that book                                 exchange something in return                                 what is the specific role of community                                 management and in that set up I mean                                 there's a reason that we have two                                 community managers on the panel here so                                 maybe this is more a question for you                                 guys what are the specifics of community                                 management in collaborative consumption                                 is it more important than in other                                 startups and what are kind of the                                 important aspects of it I mean I guess                                 maybe I can sort of talk about I think                                 the importance of community management                                 it depends on the company that you're                                 working for so ours was built as a                                 community first a community first                                 platform it's a community marketplace so                                 obviously community management is                                 incredibly important to us and we need                                 to like we want people to host their                                 experiences on gibbsy and so I think                                 it's really important to have sort of a                                 mediator which is myself in between                                 making sure                                 these people are supported and they feel                                 like encouraged and their activities and                                 they there they can look really good on                                 their website quality control sort of                                 thing and then also being a bridge                                 between the people that are booking                                 activities and also the companies sort                                 of putting out our idea of what we want                                 good Z to be the people that we want to                                 be using good Z's showing that the the                                 platform is extremely flexible for                                 anybody to use yeah I think like in                                 collaborative consumption I guess since                                 it is also very community driven sort of                                 sort of thing computing management is                                 really important but I think it's mostly                                 about the it's mostly about the company                                 and yeah good Z specifically is a                                 community first startup so that's why I                                 was important yeah for MMB community                                 management is a very important part                                 because our product is based on trust                                 and reputation and people who want to or                                 who are sharing their apartment really                                 want to know who's working for the                                 company and we want to meet us and                                 that's why we go out to meet to the                                 people and bring these people together                                 so they can share their ideas yeah yeah                                 pretty much the ideas so community                                 management for everybody is like one of                                 the important parts so it's it's about                                 connecting the users but it's also                                 connecting the company to the people                                 right to your users yeah it's like like                                 the host and the guest is a meeting                                 offline at first I mean online then they                                 meet offline but still they want to know                                 who's who's the company most people                                 don't know how big a B&B is and they are                                 oh you're in Hamburg oh you and Berlin                                 you Munich so for them it's really                                 important to know who is running the                                 company who's working for the company to                                 ask question because there are a lot of                                 questions if you're a host on Airbnb so                                 it's very important for us to go outside                                 to go to our community                                 I think sharing is all about so if you                                 have shitty people on your platform your                                 shitty company and you have awesome if                                 you have awesome people on your on your                                 platform you're an awesome company so I                                 think the the main thing that we do in                                 our community management we try to get                                 rid of the people that we don't like and                                 have most of the people that are awesome                                 and we found that if we have awesome                                 people they attract other awesome people                                 and if we have people that are sort of                                 not quite so awesome they attract other                                 people that are not quite so awesome so                                 if you if you have one guy that there's                                 made a lot of money cheating on eBay                                 you'll attract his friends to try to do                                 the same thing so when you see something                                 that that's not                                                        your platform you act immediately and                                 that that's what we do with our                                 community management so we try to give                                 examples how to behave in a good way and                                 and and make everyone feel that wrap up                                 question so we have we're sharing                                 apartments experiences desk etc what's                                 the next kind of thing big thing what's                                 what's missing what are we not sharing                                 yet that we should be you can share                                 everything I mean any you can share                                 except me before your toothbrush I mean                                 [Music]                                 missing like I can't really think of                                 something that's like what's what's not                                 there I'm sure that there's something                                 but I don't know what the basic things I                                 need maybe like I don't know I don't                                 know I don't know ask the question I                                 thought it was really appropriate and I                                 think accurate and they said why is                                 there no meta search engine that                                 combines the different forms of sharing                                 so that you can have like a package                                 experience so you can travel somewhere                                 and book out of bed and then book and                                 experience and then cook you a                                 co-working space all through sort of one                                 metal platform so I think we might see a                                 few of those emerge now                                 and I think there's a couple of software                                 companies that are working on tools then                                 so to all collaborative consumption                                 platforms for example there's a platform                                 where you can we can upload all your                                 credentials that you've collected on on                                 one of the platforms and when you join a                                 new platform people already know that                                 you're responsive that you don't have                                 any bad reviews on the other platform so                                 I think there will be a lot of stuff                                 happening in that space that sort of                                 more infrastructure good well thanks I                                 guess we can take a couple of questions                                 now if anybody wants to I don't think we                                 can pass this round                                 I had one simple question                                 I think obviously this whole                                 collaborative consumption thing is like                                 a start-up thing right now like                                 grassroots people doing cool stuff                                 companies just trying to get there is                                 that the beauty thing because you know                                 the question do you think that in future                                 companies were trying to enter the                                 market because and it's not in their                                 interest because they want to sell stuff                                 and they want to stare self sell stuff                                 and I want to share that but on the                                 other hand it's a big pocket so what do                                 you think will maybe come                                 I think there's already a couple of big                                 companies in the market for example in                                 services the the big thing I mean the                                 picture in the last                                                     don't know the English word what is                                 sight abide so so so in a certain sense                                 that is the type of collaborative                                 consumption as well although it doesn't                                 have the best image I don't know too                                 much about the other sectors that are                                 not services but at least in the                                 services sector is already big thing and                                 the services sector is huge so III mean                                 when there's a lot of money to be made                                 I'm sure that there will be a lot of big                                 companies that will look at the                                 opportunities in the space yeah I agree                                 with that I'm sure more people if they                                 if if the model sort of works and they                                 see that there's a potential there I'm                                 sure a lot of people will probably come                                 into the space and also I guess we're                                 seeing some of the startup people the                                 cool kids like Airbnb are becoming the                                 bigger companies that are that are gonna                                 be I guess in yeah the big guys that are                                 gonna rule the school of collaborative                                 consumption                                 I think the limitation is that the                                 experience has to be somewhat personal                                 you know the reason that that it's so                                 great to do these things is because you                                 get to meet somebody the other end so                                 you go to a co-working space you meet                                 the person who runs it you go doing a                                 tour you meet the person who does the                                 tour and that's the limitation that a                                 big company has they can't have a                                 personal experience with every single                                 one of their customers because they're                                 big so you know you're not going to be                                 able to break down every service that a                                 big company does to the micro level                                 where you can have sort of a one-on-one                                 interaction with the person who made the                                 thing or does the thing big companies                                 might try and get in at the level where                                 at the platform level to actually run                                 the the interaction between the two                                 people but if it's not two people                                 swapping ideas services products or you                                 know whatever then there's not so much                                 of a big company can do except try and                                 sit on top of that and take a percentage                                 one thing mentioned was you have to use                                 device good and bad news users into                                 groups you because you only want to have                                 the good ones and not the bad ones what                                 do you think about tools programs to                                 measure the influence in the virtual                                 reality of a user like cloud or                                 something similar in Germany it's not so                                 popular and it's cross-platform what do                                 you think about cross-platform user                                 influence                                 yeah I think cloud is a good example I                                 think it would be the wrong - because                                 cloud is about the influence you have a                                 not about how reliable you are but                                 there's similar things that are being                                 established like red part where it's                                 really similar to cloud only it for for                                 reliability and I think at the moment                                 all of us we all have spent an                                 incredible amount of time writing her                                 own algorithms trying to find out                                 someone registered for a site like on                                 the first day how reliable are they                                 going to be by trying to figure out how                                 how quickly do they respond to the first                                 email how quickly do they respond to the                                 first request how do they respond after                                 the first job is taking place and and                                 then you try to judge sort of are they
