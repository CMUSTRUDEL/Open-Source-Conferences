Title: #SON12: Thomas Schindler - How to save the world with currency
Publication date: 2020-02-21
Playlist: Summit of Newthinking #SON12
Description: 
	Some major flaws in the design of our currency systems lead to social and environmental problems that could easily be solved by redesigning our currencies.

It is easy to understand that cutting the lawn with a pair of scissors is not effective and cutting your hair with a lawnmower is dangerous. It is less obvious that we are we are doing the equivalent of the latter when it comes to our economy.

If we agree on the assumption that the most fundamental purpose of economy is to enable the flow of resources to where they are most needed and we also agree on the the fact that resources and needs are highly heterogenous in their nature, the obvious begins to emerge.

The questions addressed to make this more visible are:

# What are the main flaws of our currency systems?
- backing by GDP
- positive interest
- monoculture

# What are their consequences?
- encouraging misuse and destroying of resources
- putting enormous economic pressure on people and businesses
- creating an inherently instable system (Complex flow system theory)

# How can we solve these by currency-design?
- backing currencies on things we want or need more of (Example: Ghent, Belgium)
- consciously designing the behaviour of currencies by adding negative interest to the game (Example: WÃ¶rgl, Austria)
- creating multiple currencies for various ecosystems (Example: WIR, Switzerland)

# What is the state of affairs?
- approximately 2500 experiments globally
- common ground emerging
- politics beginning to integrate these ideas (Nantes, Ghent)

	                              [Music]                               this track is supposedly in English who                               does not speak it does not speak German                               so we keep it in English right so we'll                               have a very bold claim as a title and                               probably some of you think is this guy                               completely nuts what's this about what                               am I doing here                               so who thinks who thinks along these                                terms this is completely crazy how's                                this going to happen ok so so it doesn't                                seem to have lots of work to do probably                                I hope I'm not gonna bore you so as a                                beginning I'd like to talk about my                                motivation and set the scene a bit which                                is I want to talk about why I think is                                possible to do that whenever I whenever                                I start a project or whenever I speak                                with my friends about projects or their                                life just as we heard in a previous                                discussion we all run into the problem                                of scarcity so lots of ideas out there                                lots of people wanting to contribute but                                nobody knows how to actually finance all                                of this for me that's changed in in                                     when I ran into a guy called Banali at                                our who used to be the head of the                                belgian belgium central bank and was                                also part of the team that's introduced                                the euro and he was he was talking about                                the future of money the way he sees it                                and he for the first time explains to me                                how the money money system actually                                works which was which was                                and total eye-opener for me and I I                                never could see the world again in the                                same way ever ever after that and ever                                since then I've been I've been pondering                                this issue and trying to find ways of                                how to how to to attack this and how to                                modify the way we see money and how we                                are we organize ourselves with the money                                so it seems that that it basically                                creates more problems than it solves                                although it is the the underlying thing                                for for our all of our Kannamma k--                                economic issues of every every                                transaction every economical transaction                                so the current state of money I don't                                think I have to really talk about that a                                lot we all know we're we're bailing out                                we're bailing out countries we are some                                some of some of the countries try to                                shoulder whatever the other countries                                need we currently shoulder something                                like                                                                means                                and it's but it's gotten on the other                                side gotten extremely ridiculous with a                                new project or ridiculous actually                                pretty cool but in a sense of economy                                and the markets a pretty ridiculous                                situation where the the Occupy Wall                                Street                                tries to buy debt at a rate of one to                                thirty which means you donate                                          and they buy buyouts                                                  debts and simply drop that so they're                                free people of debt at a rate of one to                                thirty which is pretty pretty ridiculous                                in my eyes so in order to                                in order to understand what's what we                                could change about this system which is                                the core driver and yet seem so                                extremely buggy we should look more into                                how money is actually designed so                                there's when we look at money for a long                                time to me and it probably due to lots                                of people are not so much to you so who                                thinks in who knows how money actually                                is created where does money come from                                and who owns the central bank who owns                                the central bank banks some private                                people so let's have a look first of all                                there's this three issues with our the                                way we use positive interest is positive                                interest do that over time so you money                                pieces of money you give each one one                                piece because you fixed a fixed value                                there's one piece that's let's say off a                                chicken and after year all you want for                                that's really cool service and that                                really cool idea is one percent one                                percent is next to nothing that's not a                                problem                                so to keep the calculation easy we give                                out                                                                  things happen people are extremely happy                                everything's thriving everything's                                 beautiful                                 you're later in a turn and you want one                                 percent and you get one percent you get                                 one piece to continue so somebody is                                 broke because nobody else except and the                                 old-fashioned style of just swapping                                 things so this person needs money you                                 give them the money you just create it                                 because because you have it because you                                 can add some interest so this person                                 goes back into the game and starts                                 fighting even for even more because now                                 this person has to give you back the                                 money you lent him plus living living                                 and the only interest you you let that                                 happen for a couple of years so that's                                 that's the that's the problem with                                 positive interest let's look at the GDP                                 why is it a problem that's our money is                                 backed by GDP it used to be something                                 like gold or at least at least in the                                 money we know as soon as we start                                 backing our money by GDP we reward the                                 amount of money going through our                                 economies per year                                 that's all we do that's just a                                 quantitative measure no quality involved                                 so this thing's like kind of Celeste                                 making sure that light bulbs don't work                                 longer than                                                            social social assistance                                 worsening health care systems actually                                 war is rewarded as well because you                                 destroy a lot of things that you have to                                 build up afterwards and just measuring                                 the throughput of his society of Anakin                                 economy and using that as a backing                                 system for the need of the fact that we                                 need to increase our money base every                                 year because we have positive interest                                 it seems to be a problem as well and                                 third if you if you compare economic                                 systems to biological systems you see                                 that they all work along very very                                 common terms they're called complex flow                                 systems complex flow systems tend to                                 find the perfect spot of application                                 between resilience and maximum                                 efficiency and all systems and biology                                 tends to be slightly biased towards                                 resilience                                 now our financial system is highly                                 efficient we can we can perform huge                                 transactions or in in in a small amount                                 of time we can we see that when we                                 starts drying out the country by drawing                                 all the money out for example this time                                 it becomes extremely and stable which we                                 also see so these are three things                                 infinitely problematic with with our                                 currency system now who if we this is                                 not new it's not something I come up                                 with this is I'm just repeating what's                                 what people are have been repeating for                                 a long time over and over again so who                                 is responsible for this mess the                                 gentleman just pointed out this is a                                 privately owned business we worry about                                 monopolies like Facebook or Google yes                                 we have to worry about them but we can't                                 worry about the core one                                 absolutely dominating thing which is the                                 banking system privately owned banking                                 system which rules us all everybody here                                 just by the design of that money so it's                                 actually interesting an interesting                                 history behind that and the way the way                                 it was created to do with the way money                                 was was originally created the term bank                                 actually comes from both traders in the                                                                                                       that they were equipped to keep the                                 things that she bore all value to you at                                 an in a safe place so they gave you for                                 whatever you gave them gave you a slip                                 of the water figured people are swapping                                 slips instead of coming coming to day to                                 day to the actual bank the bench in                                 front of the house where negotiation ago                                 she ations took place and what's just                                 swap those pieces of paper and then we                                 figured out something else people                                 weren't pulling all of this stuff that                                 was in in in in a safe place so they                                 could issue more pieces of paper than                                 actually having it in a safe place and                                 that's why the banking system was born                                 it's also an interesting story which was                                 which used to be in the very beginning                                 backed by gold and issued by the United                                 States this this changed and to be in                                 many of the                                                             of legislation will changes let's you                                 the reduction of the the statement on                                 the one dollar bill which used to say if                                 you carry this piece of paper to our                                 central bank do you get a piece of gold                                 for it as was reduced over time and                                 at one point to turn Browns was swapped                                 for the term God and that just says In                                 God We Trust so he was taken out of this                                 everything he was taking out that but                                 it's still further than that in                                         was passed raising taxes to pay for the                                 interest of the of the central bank the                                 interest of the central bank land suited                                 to the country had to be paid by Texas                                 and the central bank was opened was was                                 was privately owned this bull never has                                 been ratified this is why in the States                                 people are arguing that they actually                                 aren't obliged to pay taxes executive                                 order number one one one one zero if you                                 want to have a look at it which is also                                 in action because nobody ever dismissed                                 it and which passes the rights of                                 issuing money back from the Federal                                 Reserve to the people but still this                                 whole thing is in an action the way it                                 was before but let's try and find ways                                 of performing what's John F Kennedy had                                 in minds meaning giving giving the money                                 back bringing the money back to the                                 people so how can that be done again                                 there's lots of lots of examples out                                 there in the                                                            big recession where there's this one                                 major and repeat it's example in Austria                                 MN have you heard of that there's a                                 little town burger couple of thousand                                 people and to cover all the expenses all                                 the needs they had they had a couple of                                 thousands of ice mark at the time so the                                 mayor decided he's                                 introduced a local currency with a                                 negative interest which is backed by the                                 couple of thousands rice mark they had                                 and the effect of negative currency is a                                 massive increase in in turnover in the                                 economy which means that the one of the                                 two things that we use money for which                                 is next to enabling us to to create an                                 economy is to save assets was wasn't                                 possible in this the opposite DeLong you                                 kept your money the lesson was worth so                                 you tend to spend it which it turn make                                 sure that everybody had work everybody                                 had something to eat                                 nobody had to rely on on help from the                                 city or the state and it all worked fine                                 until it was forbidden almost exactly                                 the same happens in the United States to                                 make this illegal and stopped it                                 obviously they would stay would advise a                                 president to make it illegal because it                                 was it was infinitely causing them                                 trouble for their business so these are                                 just beautiful there's a beautiful image                                 of or actually it's not just an image                                 it's a beautiful story of off of a                                 couple of islands that used to swap                                 goods and in exchange for these goods no                                 matter what's the worth of the good was                                 they would give them give give each                                 other jewelry so you could see bracelets                                 traveling into in in in the one                                 direction over the over the islands                                 because you would always give wrestles                                 to the to the right hand side and and                                 necklaces together                                 regardless of the worth of those                                 necklaces or the goods                                 it was just honoring the fact that                                 somebody gave you something so almost                                 the idea of a presence of presence of a                                 gift economy and if you become even more                                 radical you can say if you if everybody                                 gives away everything they don't need in                                 a gift economy there's no need for money                                 and everybody should have everything                                 they need so this was in the in a                                 similar situation because as I said                                 explore systems to be to be at a point                                 of optimum operation like resilient                                 beneficent so what I propose is we need                                 a plethora of different currencies for                                 different occasions different verticals                                 different different different                                 communities different societies and we                                 need to find ways and engage with each                                 other to find ways of creating those                                 types of currencies so the main the main                                 ideas about currencies about about                                 designs of currencies are what's what's                                 your interest rate is it positive is                                 negative or doesn't is it a zero and                                 what what what effects does that have on                                 the on the overall economy the second is                                 what do you back your your currency on I                                 can back it on neutral trust which would                                 be called a mutual credit system you                                 could also back it by things you want to                                 have more off because what do we get                                 more off if we if we back our if our                                 back our currency by GDP we get more GDP                                 we have to get more GDP every day every                                 year so positive interest rates with the                                 currency backed by the number of healthy                                 trees or if you can measure that to have                                 happy children in your society what                                 increase the number of happy trees and                                 happy trees                                 happy children or or a healthy healthy                                 trees in your society okay                                 so unfortunately I have spoken far too                                 long and but it's so like because I'm                                 close to the end um we're currently                                 working on a project that we call                                 Tayyaba which is a is a platform that                                 creates markets to find out what's the                                 best way to go about this with the                                 community effort trying to create                                 different currencies in different                                 environments to understand what's the                                 best currency for which environment and                                 how do we approach this whole thing                                 thank you very much so people two                                 minutes for questions who's first thank                                 you very much thank you for your talk                                 and I have two questions one or short on                                 what is your platform called again ta j                                 APA thanks                                 cool thanks and the others you probably                                 know the concept of bitcoins probably                                 much better than I do when I was just                                 thinking I was I wanted to ask you how                                 what do you think of it generally I like                                 the fact that bitcoins are limited so                                 we'll never have more than I don't know                                 the exact number but something like                                    million bitcoins so this this brings                                 back a certain assets into into your                                 currencies that's we we don't know                                 anymore because we're working on an                                 open-ended currency in general I really                                 like the fact that Bitcoin exists                                 because it opens our minds for the idea                                 of different types of designs of                                 currencies again                                 what are bitcoins backed by actually                                 nothing really but trust like most                                 currencies but the underlying algorithm                                 creates bitcoins in a way that it's                                 actually it limits itself and if this                                 knowledge is the basis for the trust in                                 the currency which is could be called                                 the backing                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]
