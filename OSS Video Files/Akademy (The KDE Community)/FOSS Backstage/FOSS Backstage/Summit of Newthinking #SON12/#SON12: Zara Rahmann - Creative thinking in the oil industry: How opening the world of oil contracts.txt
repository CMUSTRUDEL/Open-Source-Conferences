Title: #SON12: Zara Rahmann - Creative thinking in the oil industry: How opening the world of oil contracts
Publication date: 2020-02-21
Playlist: Summit of Newthinking #SON12
Description: 
	Traditionally, the oil industry is known as being incredibly secretive. But, it turns out, secrecy goes hand in hand with corruption, and both of these are bad for business. The tide is turning, even in the oil and gas industry, and contract transparency is emerging as a global best practice. But, once these contracts are out in the open, what do we do with them?

In our latest project, we've borrowed a collaborative writing procedure known as a booksprint borrowed from the open source technology world and on October 28th we will bring together a group of world class experts together to write a book on how to understand oil contracts, from start to finish in just one week.

By the time of the newthinking summit, the booksprint will be completed and, we hope, the finished book ready for publication. What did we learn from the week long event? How will this book help encourage transparent business in the oil industry? We hope it will be the basis for a series of trainings across more than 30 countries where these issues are incredibly relevant today.

	                              [Music]                               so that was actually really good                               introduction into what I'm going to talk                               about because what we did was a book                               sprint so thank you for that just                               introduce myself I work for an                               organization called open oil we do                               things like we're basically trying to                               improve management of the oil industry                                so that citizens of oil rich countries                                get to see the benefits of their natural                                resources so their countries all over                                Africa and South America who are                                horribly poor but their governments have                                lots and lots of money or they've been                                funding dictators or things like that so                                we're trying to to change the way to                                give more of that money back to people                                so we do this by publishing and also                                research into public policy and just a                                quick introduction to a couple of things                                we produce oil wiki guides so using                                media wiki software to pull together                                information on the oil industry we also                                pull out the information from these oil                                wiki's in two books self-published them                                and go to countries where these issues                                are really relevant such as Iraq Libya                                Colombia and run workshops on how to                                edit the wiki as well as producing                                another data guide to publicly available                                information so the problem that we try                                to address with this project just to                                give a brief introduction was contract                                transparency and general transparency in                                the oil industry so you think of oil you                                think of secrecy and corruption and it's                                generally thought of as closed well I                                work for someone called open oil and                                we're trying to change that one way the                                one emerging norm of best practice and                                the moment is contract transparency that                                means when a government decides to                                publish all of their contracts the oil                                contracts that they've signed with                                international oil companies so we tried                                to change this with a book sprint and                                I'm going to explain how we did that and                                a little bit I think there's quite a lot                                of crossover with the music sprint                                and then more generally how open                                business models can and are changing the                                oil industry                                so why firstly why are contracts so                                important well I mean so basically                                contracts decide things that can make a                                huge amount of difference to the world                                so just to give you an example of how                                huge the oil industry is foreign aid to                                Africa in                                                          billion dollars now next I'm gonna give                                you a figure of the value of oil exports                                from Africa so just exports not the                                total value that was produced but just                                exports was worth three hundred and                                thirty three billion dollars so that's                                many more times the value of aid and if                                you imagine how how different the world                                could look if all of that money was used                                where it should be for the citizens so                                contract transparency Kanto is very                                important I think after hearing that                                talk I kind of want to focus more on the                                the open source methods that we've used                                so let's skip over that for now so there                                are now seven jurisdictions around the                                world that publishing their contracts                                but once you've got them you've got pile                                of papers and unless you have a law                                degree which I don't they make                                absolutely no sense so we did a books                                brief bringing an open strategy to a                                closed industry and we brought together                                a group of ten people from around the                                world and this included a government                                negotiate from Sierra Leone civil                                society activist from Uganda                                someone negotiating contracts now for                                the government of Liberia and three oil                                industry experts with people with                                   years of experience have had an over                                influence they when they've been high                                oil prices it's been the companies that                                have been benefiting from this and we                                work on the model that actually                                companies the oil industry is going to                                evolve into something more of a service                                industry so a government should pay and                                in a government should pay a company to                                 do a particular role and they should                                 make profit that's fine they're a                                 company that's what they need to do and                                 that's how the economy works but then if                                 there's particularly high oil prices                                 it's the government that should be                                 benefiting from the particularly high                                 oil prices and this is something called                                 the the excess money that you can make                                 on top of non non profits is called rent                                 so we're trying to shift the majority of                                 this rent to countries where it belongs                                 rather than governments open source                                 models and things like publishing                                 contracts and opening up the world of                                 the oil industry is also really helpful                                 for governments who have who are new to                                 this industry                                 so often they're kind of negotiating                                 lead companies that have years and years                                 and years of experience and if you're a                                 new government to this you don't have                                 any experience you're coming into this                                 completely new and if everything's all                                 closed you don't know what what's normal                                 what your neighboring country agreed to                                 what you should expect but with this                                 publishing contract and opening up ways                                 of ways of communicating and ways that                                 the industry is working it means that                                 governments can learn from other                                 governments and see what mistakes they                                 made or what things they agree with and                                 then they can make more informed                                 decision and go on in a more level                                 playing field and I guess more more                                 generally if if the oil industry is run                                 in a more fair way for the citizens                                 allows a more rational development of                                 other energy systems renewables and how                                 we're going to get past our dependence                                 on hydrocarbons also things like oil                                 subsidies there are many countries in                                 the world that subsidize use of                                 hydrocarbons and because of this people                                 in the country because it's so cheap                                 they use it in a very inefficient way                                 and this isn't good for anyone based                                 this policy of subsidies is rethought                                 and this is one thing that we're working                                 on at the moment our open door policy                                 papers on rethinking energy subsidies                                 this could encourage more efficient use                                 of hydrocarbons and                                 more a smoother transition to renewables                                 and you know more efficient well better                                 less environmentally damaging ways of                                 running our economy and our energy so                                 that's that's all but I'd be interesting                                 to hear how interested to hear how if                                 there's any other comments that you have                                 from the music sprint and yeah or any                                 other comments questions                                 yeah any any questions or comments                                 please one                                 I really like the idea of the Sprint and                                 I think it was quite interesting because                                 you brought people together who would                                 never work in this particular way we did                                 our sprint in in seven days and everyone                                 was used to working in this way but over                                 a long longer period of time so I don't                                 think there was as much of a difficulty                                 in getting people's heads around it but                                 probably the biggest question is how do                                 you make money from it it's the question                                 that comes most of us how do you how do                                 you make money from this particular type                                 of work and I just wondered if if you                                 had any like one of the things we were                                 looking at was all alternative sources                                 of income other ways besides just                                 selling the book so being sponsored by                                 it in some sort of sponsorship from a                                 civil society organization from                                 governments or just to put something out                                 there I wonder even if the oil industry                                 would be interesting and sponsoring                                 something like this as a way to make                                 them look better and would you accept                                 something like this well actually say                                 this this project kind of unlike yours                                 it was funded but just the production                                 just the the actual sprint was funded by                                 gee I said the development arm of the                                 German government and a media                                 development organization so we've kind                                 of agreed with them that we will be                                 running training courses for journalists                                 for their particular groups of                                 journalists on this topic so yeah the                                 sprint was funded through that but our                                 main issue now is how to we don't want                                 to sell it this book because people gave                                 their time for free and it's really it                                 could really change the way in which                                 well the industry's managed if it's used                                 in the right way see I mean yeah the                                 training courses have been one way that                                 we've thought of we originally thought                                 you know even something like a freemium                                 you know where you kind of let some                                 things out for free and then if you want                                 to get the whole material you have to                                 pay but again that didn't seem very in                                 keeping with the ethos of of this opened                                 the open-source books print so the                                 moment that's that's something that I'm                                 looking into and we've had as I said                                 lots of interests from civil society                                 groups who want to have their own                                 workshops and we've said like if you                                 want to go look for funding from you                                 know big I don't know government                                 development agencies like the Norwegians                                 have a development arm called oil for                                 development and there are some other                                 organizations like this and we'd yeah we                                 we're kind of looking for civil society                                 groups to partner up with and look for                                 funding together on this kind of topic                                 but yeah it kind of did we do lots of                                 think about everything that we do open                                 oil is based around open source and by                                 the wiki's and we produce kind of free                                 briefings to countries when when big                                 things are happening and we just send                                 this all out for free and we've and                                 we've kind of a amass quite a lot of                                 intellectual property now and I'd be                                 interested in the the speaker battle any                                 more thoughts on on monetizing that                                 because I guess every organization or                                 anyone doing this needs to find some way                                 to to make profit out of it or just just                                 to make enough to keep it going would be                                 fine also yeah if they're gonna carry on                                 do it not have it as a hobby so yeah I                                 guess we'll hear more from that at the                                 speaker battle thank you                                 [Music]
