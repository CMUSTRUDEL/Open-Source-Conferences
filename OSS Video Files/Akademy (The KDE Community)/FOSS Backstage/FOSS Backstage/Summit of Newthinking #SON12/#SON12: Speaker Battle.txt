     that have the controversial opinions                               either couldn't show up or how to leave                               already so we have two questions that we                               would like to discuss and that our folks                               here have prepared an idea on and then                               if you have any questions you can ask                                them and that's kind of the final                                session for today so the first question                                is is there public interest in open                                strategies so the overarching question                                today overarching topic was open                                strategies and we've been discussing                                here how it changes art and production                                and the music industry and everything                                and the question is is to a public                                interest in it should this state foster                                open innovation open data etc they are                                not want to say something about that                                so is this public interest in an open                                that's the question in open strategies                                yeah I would definitely agree that there                                is and I might just give you one example                                out of my own research because I did a                                PhD on to soften comments from Microsoft                                Windows to Linux or and open source                                software to native Zorn odd so                                definitely different strategy strategies                                are not easy even so even even for for                                public organizations we could also see                                is                                the consequences that succeeded like for                                example in music was you had competition                                and for example there's a software tool                                called wild hooks that was available not                                only for the municipality that paid for                                it but for all other municipalities as                                well so you had on the one hand you                                invested in a common public good and on                                the other hand it also supported private                                businesses of the of the region and and                                I say I would say this made it a win-win                                situation and I think that's what public                                policy should be about                                okay from an open data perspective I                                would also agree that open strategies                                are really important like people can                                only participate if they have knowledge                                if they have data if they see what is                                the data that decisions are made upon                                and for innovation it's also important                                for example new business models new                                services if you have access to public                                data then you can develop new models and                                I think open data and open strategies                                are really important also when it comes                                to public transport that was a big topic                                in our tract today open public transport                                data more apps can be developed like                                people with special needs can get proper                                apps that help them to yeah to get                                through the city easier so there are                                tons of options for people if data is                                open available I guess there's                                definitely an interest and addressing                                awareness but there's also need to kind                                of educate people about this because                                it's it's still not so people and                                companies are not entirely used to being                                open in different ways I mean open                                innovation still needs to be pushed I                                mean the field of collaborative                                consumption people need to kind of get                                over this trust barrier that they have                                about sharing stuff with their                                environment so we're not entirely you                                there yet but there is definitely                                growing interest and awareness of this                                topic I guess I would say what do you                                mean they would depend what do you mean                                like sis on a society level like the                                everyday you know someone walking in the                                streets of Berlin or whether you mean on                                a government or you know like a company                                kind of perspective because on an                                everyday level I mean I bet there's                                millions of people out there who                                probably would like Linux or would like                                things you know that make you feel good                                now on your computer                                but they just don't know about them hey                                I have a bunty on my laptop and so many                                people have been a Oh                                so weird it's not that weird but they                                just don't they don't just don't just                                don't know about it and I guess that's                                going back to your point of Education                                 but then on a wider scale there's things                                 like like aid transparency that's                                 something that people are becoming                                 increasingly interested in because                                 people want to know where they're as you                                 were saying that tax money is going                                 whether it's actually being used for                                 anything other than administrative costs                                 to get you know medical supplies to                                 somewhere or have actually being used                                 for stuff they want it to be useful so                                 you know you see my problem like we have                                 people invited that had controversial                                 positions about this but we all agree so                                 how about we try to be the devil's up                                 okay let's turn this place around                                 mister when is there come up with                                 something when is there a public                                 interest on non open strategies secrecy                                 protecting particular interests right                                 try to be controversial now because you                                 all agreed anybody                                 when is it good for the state to be                                 secretive when should open strategies                                 not be applied health data so privacy                                 okay do you want to say something                                 I think of an example from archeology                                 because archaeologists already have the                                 problem like if they find their subject                                 they already destroy it so as soon as                                 they make it open everybody goes there                                 because we are like the big treasure                                 hunters and stuff is destroyed                                 immediately so they cannot do their work                                 and I think it's also a state affair                                 because I mean we are interested in our                                 histories so that stuff should                                 definitely be protected and kept secret                                 and not open until like the scientists                                 scientists did their work all right                                 anybody else maybe it's better say how                                 the state should make public their data                                 not to when it's posting when it's not                                 possible how is possible because also                                 with F that there are some layers and                                 levels of privacy that you can use also                                 with archaeologists maybe some time is                                 safer to make to know where are and                                 which kind of ecologist please places in                                 some place to make it more sure safe                                 because if everybody knows that there is                                 something there it's more difficult to                                 take it out from there destroy it all                                 right I'm wondering if we can really                                 close this topic and yet it's probably                                 about the balance I think that's what I                                 hear from what you say and it's not                                 always about completely complete                                 openness or full-on transparency but                                 finding the level of disclosure that's                                 necessary but openness also means oh                                 there she is                                 excellent but I'm really wondering where                                 this is going and as I said we don't                                 have the opponent to the idea here so                                 when I see at the moment is this open                                 strategies applied to to politics to to                                 science to data to innovation to like                                 whatever you come up with in society we                                 apply an open strategy and that's coming                                 from the processes that we have                                 discussed today so finding this boundary                                 is                                 really hard I think like finding these                                 examples where they say no it doesn't                                 apply doesn't apply to elections does it                                 it does right so okay would you like to                                 be on now so I wanted to give us a                                 statement of what she thinks how she                                 thinks her life as an artist and                                 entrepreneur will change over the next                                                                                                strategies thank you so much so so he                                 were just saying that it's open                                 strategies you know with the art with                                 all different sectors but how about                                 fashion you know what's coming your                                 shoes are gonna talk to your                                 refrigerator and they're gonna if you                                 don't go running two more kilometers                                 before you can eat that chocolate cake                                 and I'm telling you your scarf is going                                 to have special nano fabrics inside and                                 pollution protection so that when you're                                 on your moped in Beijing and there's a                                 truck in front of you you can easily                                 protect your lungs your clothing is                                 going to start talking to you and                                 telling you I think you're a little bit                                 cold let me heat it up a little more or                                 don't forget the condom right and then                                 your zipper unzip okay so the                                 interconnectiveness of things is coming                                 and I'm telling you                                                  definitely be there at the forefront                                 thank you thank you                                 excellent examples of things that will                                 change I'm looking for you this to all                                 of it thank you                                 so the next question is kind of a                                 follow-up question that we want to                                 discuss is we kind of all seem to agree                                 that producing things in an open way                                 ideally common goods is good and                                 improves our well-being or welfare now                                 there's a downside to this and that is                                 we all need to make a living                                 right nothing Zahra has an idea that she                                 wants to share basically well how do you                                 do that how do you make a living lesson                                 and I didn't more of a problem that I'd                                 all like you to solve so I mean open oil                                 everything that we do and everything we                                 produce is all under Creative Commons                                 and we produce like guides to countries                                 in oil industries that can be                                 distributed and we translate them and we                                 distribute those and we do like this                                 book the books print guide on how to                                 read and understand oil contracts and                                 we've put that online for free and we do                                 country briefings before when something                                 big is happening for example Obama going                                 to my and MA on Monday we've produced a                                 ten minute country briefing and you can                                 read it and you know you know as you if                                 you're journalists you know what                                 questions you need to ask and stuff but                                 how old do we make money from that it's                                 great that we're producing all of that                                 and it's for the public good and it's                                 with the aim of making government to be                                 held more accountable and generally                                 doing doing good things but that's not                                 paying us what we've been discussing                                 earlier is lots of these projects are                                 kind of side projects or things that                                 people do on weekends because they have                                 to make a living but is there any way of                                 making a living out of these out of                                 producing something that like                                 intellectual property how can we value                                 the the intellectual property in a way                                 that allows us to live off producing it                                 rather than working something and then                                 going home and doing something as a side                                 project yeah anyone so there's a lot of                                 trend guides out there you know and they                                 labor away at building these books but                                 how they finance it is they give that                                 part away but then for example they're                                 hired to do like high analysis for these                                 big companies right so if you can not                                 only produce these books which are                                 informative but also if you can can                                 somehow I'm gonna say data mining but                                 that's not the right word if there's                                 some very valuable data that you're able                                 to put together you know for                                 that oil companies maybe they need that                                 information then they would pay for some                                 of it and then the for the public                                 information would be free so while                                 you're you know rummaging away and                                 getting all this incredible information                                 maybe look at the greater ecosystem to                                 see if there's some valuable information                                 that someone else is not spending their                                 time at and then see if you can sell                                 that value to someone in the ecosystem I                                 I think there are two two streams where                                 the revenue can come from I think                                 there's a lot of revenue or a lot of of                                 stuff is already funded publicly for                                 example but still people don't use open                                 licenses sometimes because contractual                                 arrangements prohibit that or because                                 collecting societies are standing the                                 way and so I think there's a lot we                                 could it's it's it's you know it's small                                 things but if you change a lot of those                                 it would be possible that at least that                                 part that is any that it's publicly fun                                 in any way like with public subsidies in                                 the cultural field or research and also                                 education could be free so that would be                                 one part but of course that doesn't                                 solve the whole problem and and I think                                 that we are still in a very early phase                                 but what we can observe is that there                                 there are already some I would say                                 revenue models emerging for a post                                 copyright economy and I just to give                                 another example out of my own experience                                 I'm not I'm sure many of you are                                 familiar with this great video series by                                 Kirby Ferguson everything is a remix has                                 anyone of you seen it I can recommend it                                 it's really great so and what he did was                                 just he he wanted to make the point                                 everything is a remix and didn't just                                 want to make the point but he he built                                 he made a four-part video series showing                                 how everything is remix in music and                                 film and in in business everything and                                 they were great they were just he did a                                 terrific job and what did he do in the                                 last part of the series he said okay so                                 I provided this                                 do for you many of you liked it I want                                 to start and make my next we do project                                 it shall be a documentary that is what                                 it will be about fund me at Kickstarter                                 the whole project will be released on                                 the CCE and he collected the money                                 within                                                             supporters he plat for $                                               up it's not of course it's not a million                                 dollars but the only reason why I                                 supported him is because he proved to me                                 I can do it and then I was willing to                                 fund it because I wanted to see this                                 video I wanted it to be made and that's                                 why I paid and I think this is something                                 it doesn't rely on copyright and and I                                 think I don't think the crowdfunding is                                 the solution for all our problems but at                                 least for some and I think there we'll                                 see more and more of those models emerge                                 another potential revenue stream is                                 since its oil you know find a way to                                 maybe have people be able to offset                                 their carbon footprint and they could I                                 don't know you know in some way offset                                 it through your organization I think                                 technical level that kind of thing would                                 be quite difficult to work out to really                                 if you're taking people's money you'd                                 have to really justify we've that's                                 another thing you'd have to be able to                                 value like put a price on what we've                                 produced in order to justify that it's                                 been offset so if you can say we you've                                 taken a flight that's released this much                                 co                                                                     much money then how do we say oh we've                                 produced this guide that helps you know                                 people in poor countries hold their                                 governments accountable it's the value                                 of its its I think would be difficult to                                 value it but I see your point of kind of                                 taking the broader ecosystem into                                 account interesting                                 Christian's do you have an opinion on                                 earth it's anybody of you contributing                                 to the common good inform of Wikipedia                                 articles or free music open source                                 software anybody grammar correction of                                 Wikipedia did you get paid for that                                 okay so you have a benefit from it but                                 you won't make a living out of this                                 right so just as a background story and                                 how I came up with this question I'm                                 teaching a course in open source                                 economics and one of the final questions                                 in this course is if we would produce                                 only goods in the Commons nobody would                                 get paid of course P would get paid so                                 we would distribute to money by the                                 state you know what that's called is not                                 capitalism right so we will produce for                                 the common good we would increase                                 welfare but we don't rely on markets and                                 the answer is we don't have the answer                                 yet                                 [Music]                                 thank you you know and you lost words                                 are you ask questions from you                                 that the financing question is of like                                 open stuff it's not so much different                                 than the mechanism that goes on like for                                 the regular economy because like as you                                 were saying you are investing you just                                 have a guy money because you want to see                                 that movie and we came to my mind it was                                 the example of another GDR car the VAT                                 book which was overtaking first biphobia                                 and later by Ford but they couldn't send                                 it because people didn't believe in the                                 support so that's basically the same                                 mechanism I'm just buying the product                                 because I also believe in the support                                 but it's just yeah I'm also supporting a                                 lot of other stuff that's like the                                 system that is surrounding the product                                 if you see that then what's a big                                 question about financing open source and                                 then the mechanism is basically the same                                 is it                                 I agree and so far as that even outside                                 of the open ROM it's never easy to find                                 a project and it's never easy to get                                 getting paid and specifically in the                                 cultural industries all people are                                 getting paid badly and and I think                                 that's not the specific specificity of                                 open business models and at the same                                 time openness is also not the solution                                 to this problem                                 I think but so if that was your point I                                 agree with you ok last words well the                                 one thing I wanted to point out two to                                 last few speakers is when we talk about                                 producing common goods and then getting                                 paid for them that money is usually                                 distributed by the state right the state                                 produces public transportation education                                 nor that but a problem is if you would                                 imagine an economy where we only produce                                 common goods                                 what would the tax rate be probably                                 close to a hundred percent and again                                 that's not really a market economy                                 anymore                                 so the point really is that I don't know                                 the answer yet do you                                 so ask closing words thank you for                                 coming and for being part of this                                 discussion and we can all take away that                                 there are still things that we need to                                 ponder and well come up with solutions                                 that are not there yet like the post                                 copyright economy reform of patents and                                 also how we value the production of                                 common goods and you ask questions from                                 you anyone if not thank you and I see                                 your de Partie Thank You speakers Thank                                 You Nina                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]
