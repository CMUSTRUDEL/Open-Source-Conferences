Title: #FOSSBack 18: Diversity and Inclusion in Free & Open Source Software
Publication date: 2018-06-21
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Diversity & inclusion is very important especially for free & open source community, because:
- People in tech nowadays are hired to a big part because of their open source contributions. To improve the balance there, the free & open source software community is an important starting point.
- More diverse teams make for more innovation and serving users better than homogenous teams.
- Diverse open source projects are more welcoming and friendly towards new contributors, encouraging learning and collaboration.

We are building http://opensourcediversity.org to collect the projects and resources in this field. It is aimed at maintainers and contributors of open source projects who want to improve, as well as people from underrepresented groups who are interested in free & open source software but donâ€™t know where to start.

This talk is a showcase of the different initiatives for diversity & inclusion existing in open source, and a start for discussion where we can improve more.

	                              yeah exactly we're gonna talk to you                               about inclusion and diversity and open                               source projects and why we think it's                               necessary and it improves the the open                               source movement I'm young I'm designer                               at next cloud I'm Camilla I'm a software                               engineer at next cloud on desktop client                               hi and I'm Charlie and I'm a UX designer                               and I work at the commedia Germany and                                before I show you the numbers let's                                start with Ada Lovelace many of you                                would probably say she's the first                                computer programmer even before                                computers existed and in the early days                                doing software development was a was                                like a typical woman's job so how come                                that since the                                    the number of women has declined a lot                                in in the in yeah and tech especially                                compared to like other typically                                male-dominated fields like maybe                                medicine a law and tech it's still                                around                                                                 we look at open source the number that                                you just already saw is even lower it's                                between                                                              which studies you look at and maybe                                you're thinking that's weird                                open source is open it's it should be                                more inclusive and it's easier to get                                into there's already community you don't                                have to show a degree you just can you                                can contribute to whatever level you                                have but clearly that's not the case and                                in last year github did a big open                                source survey to find out more about the                                contributors of their platform and of                                all the respondents                                                    and just three percent were women so                                this falls in the number of the one to                                                                                                    good and maybe you're thinking ok so why                                do we need to focus on improving the                                number and open source projects and not                                in general and put our focus there                                because                                in the same study half of the                                contributors that filled out the survey                                said that their work and open source                                helped them with a current role so that                                means they managed it helped them gain                                expertise and reputation that helped                                them with a current position in tech                                right now so what we learn from this is                                that if we improve the inclusion and                                diversity and open source projects it'll                                probably help and improve the diversity                                and tech in general yeah and it's not                                only open source code but it's very                                similar you know in the content as you                                could say for example this is in                                Wikipedia this is from the page on                                gender bias on Wikipedia on Wikipedia                                and yeah it shows very clearly that                                Wikipedia editors are predominantly male                                and as such                                of course the articles and the                                representation of the knowledge will be                                primarily focused on things that men are                                interested in and because Wikipedia is                                this yeah the sum of human knowledge                                there's this shift or this this                                imbalance that is yeah not really how                                things happen so yeah this is also                                summed up in the in the Wikipedia page                                on racial bias on Wikipedia which exists                                just like gender bias where they say                                that the content suffers from the bias                                of its editors which are mainly                                technically inclined english-speaking                                white-collar man living in majority                                Christian developed countries in                                northern hemisphere so it's not only men                                women it's it's all these other                                different factors which play into this                                and yeah that's that's that's even only                                the tip of the iceberg so to say because                                this main group or this majority                                excludes like a whole bunch of other                                people like people with different gender                                identities different sexual orientations                                different skin color different abilities                                different ages but also even different                                skill level and technical affinities so                                at the very yeah at the very least what                                is important to the open source and free                                software movement is new people joining                                it so if we make it hard in these ways                                that we don't even notice is hard to get                                 involved in                                 then yeah basically we will slowly all                                 get older and then at some point the                                 movement could die out so instead of                                 yeah doing that in these ways we don't                                 even notice we can just make the whole                                 movement grow bigger and also by that                                 can get new people involved with a very                                 diverse viewpoints and yeah if you also                                 take it to the just the commercial side                                 or the financial side and there's                                 several studies by for example Harvard                                 Business Review McKinsey Stanford                                 Business and and so on that diverse team                                 simply work better their their bottom                                 line that their literal financial bottom                                 line is better like only one woman in                                 the Board of Directors or something like                                 that like increases the the financial                                 bottom line of a company and so that                                 alone should should tell you that it's                                 better to have a diverse team because of                                 course if you have a diverse team then                                 you also have can have a more diverse                                 audience because you're producing for                                 BIA more different experiences and yeah                                 that's it's just a better you have a                                 bigger a bigger audience as that and                                 yeah how we can improve Camilla will                                 tell us yeah so to start with let's look                                 at some numbers so the observe survey                                 from                                                                                                                                          likely to encounter rudeness                                 name-calling and welcoming language or                                 content and so forth five percent of                                 people witness it and sixty percent of                                 people experience this name-calling                                    percent witnessed it and five percent                                 experienced it so the problem here is                                 with the communication how people are                                 interacting on issues on pull requests                                 and why is this important because                                        people who experience it they stop                                 contributing to the project they leave                                 so if you don't pay attention to the                                 communication                                 in a project it's really damaging to the                                 project itself but one good point about                                 communication is that everyone in the                                 project can contribute to improve and                                 fix it                                 and you can do that by having a code of                                 conduct so for instance they weld up a                                 bunch of projects out there who provide                                 a template for a good code of conduct                                 like contributor covenant does that so                                 you can just change the template and add                                 this to your repo so besides having a                                 code of conduct it's really important                                 that everyone in the project is aware of                                 it communicate it's very important so                                 this is from a talk from una Kravitz you                                 know she gave this talk about getting                                 designers involved in open source and so                                 this is something else that you can do                                 in your project that is to have feedback                                 guidelines just some guidelines about                                 how you can improve your communication                                 it'd be nice to people in your project                                 so just highlight some points here so I                                 think it's really important to be                                 specific sometimes you are talk about                                 the problem someone else codes and this                                 is very logic to you but not weather to                                 everyone involved in the discussion so                                 it is good to say why you're pointing                                 out what or saying what you are saying                                 in the discussion is also very important                                 to avoid exaggerations hyperboles this                                 can really be the motivating and maybe                                 even insulate the discussion and so                                 besides code of conduct and have a good                                 feedback guideline on how people should                                 communicate una kravitz are looking to                                 some open source projects and she                                 noticed that other projects had good                                 documentation good website and good                                 guidelines had more female involve it                                 and so meaning in the open source survey                                 to also point out that people from                                 minority groups they really care about                                 documentation and good guidelines so a                                 good documentation Chris diversity and                                 diversity increases documentation                                 because people who                                 from the minority who is contributing to                                 your projects they are going to also                                 improve the documentation guidelines                                 code of conduct another way of improving                                 diversity is to make sure you label your                                 issues                                 now github has standardized that with a                                 good first issue so you can label it                                 making sure that it will starts in the                                 project know where to start with so                                 there are a few projects out there who                                 can help you with it like up for grabs                                 you can submit your projector so people                                 who's starting can look for your project                                 and the issues they can start to or con                                 and there is your first PR who is a                                 Twitter account that is a Twitter                                 account where they are constantly                                 putting up a date in the timeline with                                 started issues from github so they post                                 on their Twitter good first issues                                 another interesting fact is about that                                 women are more likely to seek out help                                 directly                                                                 of women they look for people they                                 already know well so I was actually                                 surprised to see these numbers because I                                 do that myself at the time to ask for                                 help and ask questions I always look for                                 people I already know so that was                                 another reason for us to have working in                                 open source diversity because we want to                                 create a safe place or everyone who is                                 starting can look for help to get                                 started in open source so these numbers                                 these facts they really show that this                                 is really important this is just a fact                                 thank you so two years ago in October we                                 thought about what we could do to help                                 people from underrepresented groups join                                 open source projects and open source                                 projects diversify and so we came up                                 with doing a hackathon we called it                                 opens first ladies back then and we                                 invited different open source projects                                 we had libre office next cloud media                                 wiki                                 and others come and join us and we had                                 participants and they were we had a                                 whole day where they got basically                                 personally mentored and and this worked                                 out so well that they both groups asked                                 us if we could continue this in some way                                 and so what we did afterwards is we                                 created a meet-up it's now called open                                 source diversity because open source                                 ladies was a bit restricting and that's                                 not what we wanted and we meet up once a                                 month in Berlin and anyone with the open                                 source project can come and get help on                                 how to diversify it people who are just                                 interested in joining or contributing to                                 something have a space where they can                                 talk to someone directly and get                                 involved in a in like a in an in a low                                 barrier easy way yeah that's our goal                                 with that and we're not the only ones                                 with these initiatives in Bangalore                                 India there's a group called                                 diversifying open source and they do                                 something similar where they help                                 encourage open source projects                                 timi Metaverse and help people join them                                 and there are mozilla does monthly calls                                 in about diversity and inclusion and                                 open source projects so you can just                                 join there and talk about codes of                                 conduct or how to make your event more                                 inclusive and there's other initiatives                                 that you probably know and two of them                                 are rails girls Summer of Code in                                 outreach e they're both projects which                                 are similar to a google Summer of Code                                 which help diversity in open source so                                 you should consider participating there                                 as an organization or donating or yeah                                 just spreading the word mainly it's it's                                 very cool like with next load for                                 example we participate there often and                                 it's really super cool like the the                                 participants we get from that and                                 there's four conferences there's there's                                 two good resources one is called speak                                 adenine or org it's a platform for women                                 speakers where you can register and you                                 can if you organize the conference you                                 can find women speakers and                                 four participants there's diversity                                 tickets where you as a conference can                                 submit your event and as a person from                                 an underrepresented group you can you                                 can look through the events and see                                 where there's an event for example which                                 offers reduced tickets or tickets for                                 free or accommodation and travel support                                 yeah so should support your submitter                                 and that if you organize any events and                                 because we were collecting all these                                 resources and yeah some are easier to                                 find some are more difficult to find we                                 decided to make it a website it's called                                 open source diversity org and you can go                                 there and you see for example                                 contributor covenant up for grabs your                                 first PR and the other ones that we                                 mentioned are also on there and yeah                                 we're kind of making it as kind of a hub                                 for the open source diversity and                                 inclusion people to communicate and to                                 share their their knowledge and to just                                 like strengthen that movement basically                                 because for example also as a designer                                 because I'm also as a designer a person                                 who's not or where there's originally                                 not that many people in coming source                                 community I see that both and diversity                                 where-where-where the open source                                 community behind so in comparison to                                 proprietary project so those two are                                 really some important things that we                                 have to invest in now if we don't want                                 to lag behind like five ten years from                                 now so yeah that's basically it thank                                 you and join our community                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]                                 yeah thank you very much are there any                                 questions from the audience just raise a                                 hand uh no thank you great topic and                                 great discussion I was wondering if you                                 could provide a little bit more                                 information about the success of the                                 renamed from open source ladies to open                                 source diversity I know a number of                                 smaller groups who are also thinking                                 about renaming theirs as well for the                                 same reasons as you but there is                                 concerns from their membership that it                                 will either dilute their message because                                 they're not focusing on a specific you                                 know disadvantaged group or                                 disenfranchised group or it will                                 encourage infiltration from non                                 Desirables so I was just wondering what                                 your your background experience was um                                 we don't have any non desirable to be                                 diverse everyone should be able to                                 participate we just want to create a                                 like a welcoming space for people who                                 are you yeah I'm usually like we pointed                                 out in the github survey maybe encounter                                 more rudeness or this kind of behavior                                 and we we often got like messages from                                 people who maybe felt that didn't belong                                 in this underrepresented group and asked                                 if they could join because they were                                 working on something I wanted to put                                 support the initiative and of course                                 they can so we wanted to open up the                                 name because it was never just aimed at                                 one specific group but yeah just to                                 compliment so you just switch the name                                 right it's very recent so I don't have                                 numbers yet and but yeah that's what                                 Charlie said so we just want to make                                 sure it's clear the message that is for                                 everyone not only women and the non                                 desirable people I believe I guess you                                 meant like people who are might be                                 sexist or I guess I say but yeah I mean                                 so far we didn't have anybody experience                                 so I so far didn't ever think any really                                 bad experience                                 but we should keep eye on make sure the                                 community is healthy right um yeah I                                 don't know if he meant like what Kant                                 said before like the white male from the                                 Northern Hemisphere in a sense those are                                 also welcome what who's not welcome
