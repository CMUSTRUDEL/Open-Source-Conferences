Title: #FOSSBack 18: Jos Poortvliet & Sam Tuke â€“ Discussion: building an open source business
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Red Hat, Jenkins, phpList, NGinx, Nextcloud, Mautic, openNMS, GitLab, Collabora.

These companies have one thing in common: they are operating an open source business model. A variety of models, from charging for consulting and support to providing additional enterprise functionality in a separate edition or hosting their own software for a fee.

Each of these models has its advantages and disadvantages and we'll present those quickly, moving on then to a discussion about what works in what situation, what issues there are and what could be done better. Sharing experiences and ideas and perhaps coming up with novel solutions!

If you're part of, advising to, thinking about starting or transitioning to an organization with an open source business model, this is a good place to put your challenges to a group of peers.

Some things we'd like to discuss:
- What does and doesn't work in what situation or market
- What are common challenges and solutions
- When should you use open source and when not

   run an open source business called PHP                                lists we are software as-a-service                                open source email marketing platform bit                                like MailChimp in the past I've worked                                for collabora specifically with their                                libre office online and libre office                                related products                                I worked also five years for the Free                                Software Foundation Europe so I've moved                                from non-profit to for-profit to yeah                                where I am now through campaigning to                                marketing to more strategic side and                                certainly off and I have and continue to                                experience plenty of challenges                                strategically speaking and marketing                                wise with respective open source                                products on a regular basis we had a                                great overview of challenges faced by                                elastic in the last session and I'm                                looking forward to hearing the                                challenges that you guys have faced and                                hopefully some solutions that you found                                work really well for you                                so that's me and this format is designed                                to be as participatory as possible we                                can thank the frost backstage guys for                                actually suggesting to us to use this in                                the first place                                yes it's a first for us I know it's a                                first for many of you but we call this                                the fishbowl circular almost and we will                                have effectively a panel discussion                                where any of you can enter or exit as                                you wish depending on what you want to                                contribute when something comes up that                                you have                                some burning content too to add we will                                keep one chair free out of the six at                                all times and that means that any of you                                can occupy that empty seat as you wish                                so you just need to get up walk over and                                sit down there will be too many eyes on                                the discussion so don't worry about that                                and probably they'll be looking at the                                back of your head in any case that                                includes questions by the way so anytime                                you have something to contribute at all                                to the discussion you just need to get                                up take a seat and either wait for a                                natural break or or or fight for an                                opportunity to to make your point                                yes and I will be moderating during this                                will be in different roles and we'll be                                switching our roles at different times I                                think it'll be fairly obvious hopefully                                what what we're doing but your focus                                will be the debate rather than what's                                going on with us and yeah we will rotate                                between themes so we have some hopefully                                interesting questions for you that will                                provide some stimulus for this debate to                                to flow around and at a couple of points                                during this panel discussion a new theme                                will be introduced and at that point                                we'll probably ask some or all of the                                members of the panel as they are at that                                point to to switch and we reserve the                                right to invite people in a particular                                points or theoretically yes so the main                                rule of the model is that only the                                people on the panel speak and the rest                                wait do to have their say when they                                manage to join the panel so when                                somebody joins one of the other people                                has to leave of course you're free to                                choose if you I mean if you just have                                one thing to add I mean you can get up                                join speak your piece and leave again I                                did you can leave at any time and                                 actually that's helpful because it helps                                 other people to join if there are two or                                 three free chairs please really consider                                 joining if all six years are full and                                 you're sitting there please consider if                                 you know maybe it's time for somebody                                 else to say something yeah well we'll                                 have to see how it flows if people join                                 too much too little maybe we'll nudge                                 people or you know try to tell them not                                 to leave but                                 yeah we'll see how it goes good okay so                                 again the previous talk did a great job                                 of introducing a few different models                                 for open source businesses we've grouped                                 them into three categories for                                 simplicity products based services based                                 and SAS based so these are like the kind                                 of offering that the company provides                                 and we're gonna go into a bit more depth                                 now just so we have a common framework                                 of language and understanding before we                                 get into the panel I know different                                 people have different backgrounds and                                 it's helpful to be able to communicate                                 on the same themes so product based the                                 product might be well generally Hardware                                 type products so typically this is when                                 companies want to move up the the value                                 chain and the software is no longer                                 where they're making their profit right                                 so classic example would be IBM who                                 wanted to focus on their the hardware                                 business but they recognized that the                                 software side was a necessary complement                                 for them to be able to sell their                                 hardware there their server hardware                                 without that they just couldn't do any                                 business so they shared the cost that                                 the load by open sourcing and                                 incorporating existing open source                                 software and extending it those the kind                                 of hardware products we're talking about                                 also guitar mod is a nice example                                 startup based here in Berlin they make                                 guitar panels they sell the hardware the                                 software is fully open source it's a                                 very nice platform uses lv                                          maybe some of you the Linux audio                                 conference last weekend maybe not catch                                 it next year then we have licensing                                 jewel licensing so elastic gave us a                                 good example of that also in the                                 previous talk if you were here they used                                 your licensing with their own custom                                 EULA agreement as well as the                                 open-source licenses that they use for                                 their for that yeah for the open-source                                 offerings other examples of companies                                 are using licensing nginx Magento                                 recently got acquired by Adobe for                                 roughly                                                                  yeah get lab MySQL own cloud not next                                 cloud selling binaries absolutely so                                 that's kind of a convenience thing right                                 there are plenty of open source apps                                 which are on the Google Play Store and                                 making good money revenue wise from that                                 collabora has also used this in the past                                 for some of their their desktop products                                 there's there's obviously there's a lot                                 of work that goes into making the                                 software behind it but the way that                                 that's monetized can can often be by                                 charging for access to the binaries the                                 the convenient updates the repositories                                 and so on creature on steam exactly                                 those are both examples of Android apps                                 right at the bottom so the second main                                 model of making money on open sources of                                 course services I mean if you have a                                 community of open-source developers and                                 you're building a piece of open-source                                 together and somebody comes and says hey                                 I want feature X it is not terribly hard                                 to imagine that that person come develop                                 it themselves and look for somebody to                                 pay to do it and at which point you                                 basically have the beginnings of a                                 consulting service and of course if you                                 have that expertise and you put it                                 together and the company and you're                                 developing software already for other                                 people it's a pretty small step to say                                 well we can also maybe train your system                                 administrators to deploy the software or                                 we can give a training on how to add                                 modules or you know other stuff and                                 basically you're simply sharing the                                 knowledge that you have as participants                                 in the community the third model is a                                 little different from the first two it's                                 it's on one hand it's the same you're                                 simply using your expertise to support                                 if you're a big company you're deploying                                 a piece of software that you need to                                 basically run your business it's                                 business critical and you don't have a                                 support contract and the system goes                                 down pretty sure that this is that mean                                 who was responsible for deploying that                                 piece of software and then not getting a                                 support contract is well probably                                 looking for another job soon so one way                                 of putting the support offering is                                 usually providing job security to the                                 people who deployed the software and the                                 interesting thing and the difference                                 between the first two and the third is                                 that the third skills in a different way                                 if you need to give twice as many                                 trainings you need to have twice as many                                 people giving trainings if you need to                                 write twice as much software for                                 customers as consultant you need twice                                 as many people actually we all know the                                 reality of a company is that have you                                 have twice as many people doing work                                 you've got about four times as many                                 managers as overhead and your total                                 costs go up exponentially so these                                 models don't scale in a very fundamental                                 way if you run                                 an open-source community or you're part                                 of an open-source community you want to                                 build a business around it and you want                                 to essentially pay people to work on the                                 software to improve the product use in                                 the end your passion is to work on this                                 open source project and if that is your                                 goal then consulting can work because                                 sometimes these customers pay you for                                 features that you perhaps would have                                 wanted to develop at some point anyway                                 and essentially by paying money they                                 change the priorities which is fine                                 which can be good                                 but we also all know that first of all                                 customers usually have no vision about                                 future they want a little extra button                                 they want to disable something they want                                 to add stuff that you would never want                                 in your product or they just want a                                 sixth encryption algorithm so this is                                 not great for product development and                                 training doesn't help you at all it                                 might help you grow your community but                                 it won't really help you make your                                 software better but the third one could                                 because if you have twice as many                                 customers you don't need twice as many                                 support people it's more like I don't                                 know                                                                   next lads our main benefit of support is                                 actually you get direct access to our                                 engineers so yes our engineer spend a                                 percentage of the time on support but                                 that percentage is pretty low it usually                                 helps them fix bugs keeps them a bit in                                 contact with the needs of customers so                                 it's win-win it's not that costly and                                 the more customers we have the more                                 engineers we can hire and they do work                                 on the product so we do improve necks                                 out by getting more customers which                                 would not really have been the case with                                 the other tool so doing if you want to                                 build the product you essentially need a                                 support model one way or another                                 well let's debate that in a minute right                                 well let's get the next one okay so                                 software-as-a-service                                 oh I'm sorry so first services my                                 business model you're all very familiar                                 with it it's possibly more open source                                 new open source being created software                                 as a service than any other that I see                                 anyway at the moment again you're                                 familiar with it so let's move on to the                                 next and that's the first question and                                 now we're at the first question exactly                                 so we want your views on why we would                                 choose to build our business                                 you know on top of open source products                                 to start with products or services like                                 why do it I mean a lot of this                                 discussions probably gonna be about the                                 challenges right so we need to remember                                 the the the motivations that we started                                 out with also in the previous session we                                 heard how successful projects like                                 postgrads SQL and many others exist                                 quite fine without having a single you                                 know commercial entity behind them so so                                 what are the advantages some of the                                 advantages might be erecting barriers to                                 entry for other firms so that it's less                                 attractive for proprietary software firm                                 to enter a market where they know that                                 there's already a good enough or even a                                 great free offering license free                                 offering other advantages might be                                 access to decision-makers because if                                 you're in a repository it's super easy                                 to apt-get or yum install the software                                 maybe it's a bit harder sell for a                                 system administrator to download a                                 proprietary binary that they don't trust                                 so much and yeah we know that with data                                 protection changes and also policies and                                 particularly sensitive sectors being                                 able to self host or just being able to                                 inspect the source code can be a real                                 differentiator maybe especially with                                 gdpr where personally we're getting a                                 lot of more inquiries about moving data                                 to Europe for example at PHP lists                                 because of these onerous obligations                                 from the gdpr and yeah so why do it so                                 who here is working for or running their                                 own open source firm as it stands right                                 right now would be lovely if some of you                                 would join already and then we can start                                 a conversation with just going over well                                 the reasons why yeah your company is                                 using open source exactly if you raise                                 your hand please please take one of the                                 five free available seats thank second                                 yes you join yeah I will make that and                                 the microphones so I have only two                                 microphones so you have to hand them                                 around a little bit but I think to will                                 speech the face we still have an empty                                 with two empty seats well face Michael                                 we'll see yep okay that's the trick so                                 that's the only one I think we're good                                 so guys why why did you start out well I                                 was already involved in Hadoop and had                                 been for quite a few years and actually                                 let me run through the story of how                                 harden works got founded basically our                                 CEO Rob Bearden was working at benchmark                                 capital and he was looking to invest in                                 a hadoop company and so he started                                 looking around talked to some of our                                 competitors I saw that they weren't                                 driving the tech as much as the group of                                 us over a yahoo and he wanted he'd done                                 open source companies before and wanted                                 to get the people who were actually                                 driving the majority of the tech forward                                 and so he actually started through the                                 negotiation between us Yahoo management                                 and benchmark so there was an existing                                 open source application had to write had                                 value and had been proven and community                                 exactly and some of the consumers of                                 that product effectively were unhappy                                 with the speed of development they                                 wanted to accelerate it actually mostly                                 they wanted commercial support but they                                 also wanted to accelerate the direction                                 so was to provide to cater to their own                                 needs effectively to their own                                 commercial support needs                                 so exactly companies wanted someone to                                 call in the middle of the night if their                                 Hadoop cluster went down because Hadoop                                 of course ends up in people's production                                 pipelines and that's actually critical                                 to this whole thing is your application                                 has to be critical to their business                                 because they have to see a negative                                 value if their system goes down or                                 they're not going to pay for support                                 yeah yeah there isn't there's actually                                 not much I can add to it it's it's                                 really open source is a type of way how                                 you release things right I mean it's not                                 about it's it's not from a business                                 perspective it's not about doing the                                 right thing but                                 it's more in providing people actually                                 with the missing gap and that's what                                 what we also do I mean campano                                 so you identified a katana that your                                 customers are missing something that                                 that there's a something that's not                                 being delivered something that's not                                 being catered to because somehow by                                 being open source a katana your product                                 does something that your competition                                 does not what is the gap then well the                                 gap is is specifically for us we are the                                 only open source market back-end that                                 exists in the world so moppy in itself                                 from looking top to bottom is quite easy                                 but it can get very complex and we're                                 talking about a standard that exists now                                 for                                                                      is yeah sort of a standard markup sided                                 for email exchange well it's it's not                                 just email it's test notes whatever I                                 mean everything that comes from the                                 messaging world if you imagine Microsoft                                 Outlook that's that's the primary                                 mapping client in the world and I mean                                 this this actually comes as as a                                 derivation or a derivative from Rafa                                 which was an open core company and we                                 actually had quite some nice tenders and                                 we actually decided and to say you know                                 what let's double down on open we didn't                                 want to do open core anymore because it                                 also had some some downsides to it and                                 the Capano refounding also enabled us to                                 get rid of the proprietary bits so I                                 mean Microsoft Outlook is still a                                 dominating client in the world                                 especially in the business world but                                 people are starting to realize well                                 there is other good stuff as well and                                 that's where it actually comes in the                                 community is also a great thing because                                 you know you get suggestions and a much                                 direct much-much fluent way yeah let's                                 call that way so your product can                                 improve by other people that send in                                 patches PRS whatever and at the same                                 time you get a feeling actually for                                 where where you want to go and the                                 commercial side of it this is actually                                 that you get that a little bit                                 reprioritize by the customers obviously                                 but it's it's it's one world and                                 saw the product and told those are some                                 clear benefits that you get as an                                 open-source running an open source                                 project company well however we want to                                 describe it but it's hard to put a                                 dollar value on those contributions                                 right I mean you can also have lead                                 customers as proprietary firm where                                 these the reasons why is there a fur for                                 example if we take one step back because                                 because you're saying that your decision                                 within Capano to continue to be open                                 sources is partly an extension of the                                 heritage of the firm by the sounds of                                 things right sort of the thing is sister                                 following when you when you end up with                                 just having the commercial side of it                                 you will end up having a product that is                                 just tailored for example for enterprise                                 business we have a lot of enterprise                                 customers ranging in six-digit user                                 installations but the problem is is that                                 they have different needs than a                                         installation or a                                                     and our goal was to provide a software                                 that works for both worlds so it's very                                 modular it works in very tiny                                 you can run it on a respite because it's                                 a big a target market you're gonna be                                 selling to both those those use cases is                                 one thing and the other thing is is that                                 especially in a communications market if                                 you have a communication solutions like                                 we do then you need something that works                                 for teams also in smaller areas and also                                 for large ones it's a little bit a hard                                 thing right because the the need of a                                 small customer is completely different                                 from an enterprise customer so with it                                 with the open source community you get                                 kind of for free a very broad variety of                                 users and and feedback an input onto                                 shaping the yes the product yes yeah buy                                 for free I meant like not on the                                 individual basis but obviously there is                                 a cost to supporting a community please                                 we'd like to hear from you ok so my                                 company is called shake blue we were                                                                                                    effectively I mean I you choose these                                 words carefully but we're effectively a                                 vendor in that in that community                                 we don't sell software we sell services                                 and in fact our journey is very similar                                 to that                                 you know the slide deck you had up there                                 in terms of we started as a general                                 consultancy I used to run a service                                 provider business before then and we                                 were consulting helping organizations                                 build their there                                 infrastructures and that sort of thing                                 and then we got more and more dragged                                 into this project and over time we would                                 move from consulting to training then                                 offering the supports because of demand                                 exactly exactly                                 but one really interesting thing so most                                 of our revenue comes from support and                                 it's been a very successful business                                 model for us but the key bit that you                                 didn't have on your slide is a lot of                                 our customers effectively want us as a                                 community proxy so they don't want to                                 get involved in the open source project                                 we try to get them involved but some of                                 these organizations just want to cut a                                 purchase order and know their software                                 is going to work at an interface to what                                 specifically in the community though                                 because they probably don't want the                                 flame wars and so on it's it's the                                 access to the engineering access to the                                 engineering access to where the project                                 is going in terms of you know that you                                 know their business is going in this                                 direction they want some more support                                 around a particular technology so                                 somebody can you know people in the in a                                 provider who can actually have sort of                                 help influence the direction of the be                                 objective and to be frank you know they                                 haven't got time to do that or the                                 inclination to do it which makes me sad                                 sometimes I you know I really wish some                                 of our customers would get more involved                                 in the project but that's that there's                                 this challenges around that particular                                 with the Apache governance model I mean                                 we've got                                                               and                                                                     sort of quite dominant within the                                 project and I have to go to a lot of                                 effort to make sure we don't get                                 perceived as this vendor that's trying                                 to do things in our own direction and                                 the only way of doing that is to                                 actually have you know community first                                 ad you know a part of your interface the                                 community that you've got to manage                                 expectations both sides place a solution                                 which sometimes makes you know the                                 internals of running a business                                 sometimes a bit of a challenge because                                 you know I have PMC members who are                                 direct reports to me at worked and                                 sometimes we have to sort of take work                                 hat off and put PMC hat on yeah but it's                                 worked and we've just fallen into that                                 model there was no great strategy around                                 it we fell into this project so it                                 sounds like we've got two projects                                 represented here who were taking an                                 existing open source application or                                 ecosystem and because of strong demand                                 for that product because it was it's                                 proven its value you were responding to                                 demand and yeah delivering services on                                 top in your case you                                 both with the Rafah and Capone who                                 created new products effectively they                                 incorporated some other open-source                                 applications as most do but you took the                                 decision to actually incorporate                                 something fresh and in your case was it                                 an existing product or something fresh                                 it's not a product so I've previously                                 been involved in running software                                 services companies multiple times and my                                 background was primarily proprietary                                 software but system software hard stuff                                 so claiming to be great engineers okay                                 when I got involved in coding I was                                 trying to find out what the                                 open-source was about and I discovered                                 actually the people encoding it was very                                 small at the time which is dramatically                                 better than the people I would typically                                 work with so one of the things that                                 actually motivates me is doing great                                 work and to be suddenly surprised by an                                 organization which was working for the                                 same kind of companies I already had                                 experience with but there people were                                 demonstrably better change my                                 perspective it's not to say that it's an                                 easy road but as a result of focusing on                                 better quality engineering you say a                                 little bit more for people who aren't                                 familiar with Co think so better well                                 the engineering of what what we our                                 system software engineering specialists                                 so that means one thing one of the                                 things like announcer is companies call                                 us when their project is completely                                 screwed when they've had much bigger                                 companies to do a custom Linux system                                 and they've completely messed it up                                 because they don't understand how                                 upstream works how the communities work                                 and it really does keep happening that                                 our customers and our competitors                                 discover that our people look just no                                 more and that is it's not achievable                                 without the collaboration so I came to                                 realize over a few years that the part                                 of the difference is everybody's talking                                 to everybody and sharing the information                                 getting involved in those communities                                 exactly the proprietary guys are                                 googling and saying oh yes I'm a little                                 UNIX expert but they're not doing the                                 work they're not gaining the same level                                 of knowledge so it's it's become a clear                                 differentiator for us I remain                                 astonished that there are so few                                 straight software services firms that                                 play this card you know collaborators                                 one it gallier is another but in our                                 space there are very                                 the organization's competing as much                                 bigger companies that are demonstrably                                 worse than us so you're again                                 interfacing to these open-source                                 communities and adding the experts                                 you're hiring from these communities to                                 presumably in order to get this                                 engineering expertise interesting yeah                                 so please and also somebody needs to                                 vacate so an entirely different                                 direction I'm not working for this                                 company anymore but I was working for a                                 company that was going into a market                                 that's already pretty sexual that's                                 rated and one of the strategies that the                                 existing companies in this market was                                 using was was vendor lock-in we have                                 your data how are you going to get your                                 data out of our system and into that                                 system think about it you wouldn't want                                 anything bad to happen to your lovely                                 data right so one of the advantages that                                 the company I was working for was using                                 or as they're saying will help you solve                                 this problem with getting your data out                                 but once you have your data out you                                 weren't gonna want to think about this                                 not happening again                                 we promise that will give you your data                                 a but that doesn't do you much good if                                 you don't have a software that can                                 operate on the data look we're open                                 source so it actually means something                                 that will give you your data so do I                                 understand then that you were providing                                 so this so what came out of this by the                                 way that can you name the project                                 although the product this is actually                                 the company was name is named Quayle app                                 and the project has been around direct                                 um so the value that finna act adds that                                 one of the key differentiators the                                 benefits that it gets from being open                                 source is that your customers know that                                 vendor lock-in is not so much of a                                 threat right and so therefore you depend                                 upon those customers understanding that                                 understanding that that's valuable and                                 and being prepared to pay for it and                                 because the market is fairly old many                                 customers have had negative experience                                 with vendor lock-in at this point yeah                                 we have exactly the same situation and                                 when we took our support service to                                 market we sort of promoted it as an open                                 source you know being a fully open                                 source around the open source product we                                 act                                 she had a very large vendor in our                                 project at the time I won't use their                                 name here because it's been recorded who                                 were trying to sell her for our                                 proprietary distribution of cloud stack                                 as well science my family and we were                                 very very successful in the space                                 because we went to the customers and                                 said no this is completely open-source                                 we will sit on the side and they liked                                 that message it did with some                                 particularly sort of traditional                                 conservative organizations it took some                                 time to get that message through because                                 they had vendors telling them how they                                 polish everything so it shines so much                                 which wasn't always the case but I think                                 you know the market is coming round to                                 that concept of open source gives them                                 you know a peace of mind and a long term                                 organic stability to the software that                                 they won't get from a vendor who's a                                 roadmap is gonna flick all over it                                 they might leave a project and that's                                 actually exactly what happened with with                                 a patchy cloud state do we have                                 experience with targeting a market which                                 does not understand or value the                                 differences of open source beyond these                                 technical consumers technical decision                                 makers system administrators who maybe                                 they know this product there that they                                 know the projects and other community                                 know others need to interface but what                                 about maybe consumers like n you know                                 end users who are not from this line man                                 I have an awesome story to share here we                                 provide a web application that has been                                 multiple times awarded it's really nice                                 and we also have a desktop application                                 which embodies this web application I                                 also want to say the customer here but                                 it's someone everyone knows and the the                                 problem that we had was they were using                                 Outlook all over the place they were                                 happy with it and then they heard okay                                 we're not going to support Outlook in                                 that way as we did in the past and so                                 we're thinking of what can we do to make                                 the people actually accept it this is no                                 joke we just replaced the icon                                 of our thing renamed it out look at the                                 acceptance was really there this is the                                 desktop or the cloud product it's a day                                 the reality is is this don't ask a user                                 for what actually is about four Adem                                 that was all it's a new outlook version                                 right the reality is there's there you                                 always have to make a differentiation of                                 what type of users you're talking to                                 obviously in in Hadoop world the users                                 consumers are just on a completely                                 different technical level exactly and                                 the thing that we have is this is that I                                 mean something like email is basic right                                 but we all not only do that we do web                                 meetings which can get more complex but                                 the consumer wins by the effect that the                                 solution is still easy so our our main                                 problem is is you have to make things so                                 stupid so so really yeah intuitive in a                                 way that you don't have to teach the                                 people but the the biggest challenge for                                 us at least is is to get people think                                 about new things right so you know when                                 when people log in to Google on Gmail                                 right they know it's a web application                                 so the expectation management there is                                 is quite natural when they go into their                                 business and they're used to Microsoft                                 Outlook then they expect the fat client                                 which is like over freighted with all                                 kinds of stuff but they don't expect web                                 meetings and stuff like that sort of the                                 fun part is is really managing these                                 expectations just renamed it rebranded                                 whatever in the sub brands are extremely                                 powerful but there are ways around them                                 if the products up to par that's the                                 lesson we can take from this ok good                                 we have some other questions that we                                 would like to put to the room is there                                 any final point on why start an                                 open-source business in the first place                                 that we'd like to make before we move on                                 actually wanted to make one more point                                 which was that of course as a dev rather                                 than a business guy I love working on                                 open source and so making a company                                 where we get to work on open source and                                 keep the whole product open across the                                 stack and not open                                 is really awesome right and we could                                 perhaps say acting the talent in yeah I                                 mean just like he was saying that people                                 like quirky and open-source and so it                                 makes it much easier to hire actually                                 they can be part of the vision of a                                 product in itself right okay so thank                                 you very much I think we should refresh                                 the panel now and I'm gonna put the next                                 question on screen thank you all right                                 so because this is a reasonably common                                 model we wanted to put up a couple of                                 questions around the selling it as a                                 support with services packets                                 essentially selling it as a product and                                 it's kind of funny to hear that one of                                 the people on the panel actually went                                 from consulting to training to support                                 because for a lot of companies at least                                 the ones that I talked to that are doing                                 a support model it's very hard for them                                 not to be pooled into consulting which                                 has the downsides that I mentioned                                 earlier at least you know perceives down                                 size and the other problem is of course                                 if you're trying to build an open-source                                 business and trying to sell support                                 using the money from that to improve the                                 product somebody else could simply try                                 to sell support without wasting the                                 money on improving the product and                                 undercutting you and well there are a                                 couple of other questions I'd like to                                 put to the panel so if you have any                                 thoughts on these things and if you work                                 in organizations like any of those                                 please join the circle and let's have a                                 conversation about them                                 at least coupon now I know you were just                                 in the room but and I I really loved ya                                 sorry I hate to put you in again but I                                 really appreciate it                                 I'm sure there are more consultants in                                 the room right Sammy yeah I mean at a                                 conference like this you can move you                                 can move if you want the fresh chair                                 right cool                                 yeah maybe begin with how do you avoid                                 the trap that you know yeah I mean it's                                 it's always a risk if Sarris this one                                 and just know it I mean it's always a                                 risk but what we did when we built our                                 support offering we went to great                                 lengths from experience of having run a                                 managed service provided before I didn't                                 want to get into that business and                                 that's why loosely use that term vendor                                 we do that vendor style support so our                                 support this is effectively full of                                 engineers I think somebody else maybe                                 made the same comments which means it                                 fits very well with their day job which                                 is committing stuff upstream and working                                 on features and working on our project                                 roadmap and what have you there are                                 other people offering support services                                 around our project but none of them do                                 it the way we do which is basically                                 you're you're logging a ticket and it's                                 a committer dealing with it so that's                                 the service we we offer and I think                                 that's a really important thing to to                                 get right if you're going to build a                                 business which is taking customer money                                 to to de-risk their organization based                                 on your technology and you're going to                                 invest that in the technology you have                                 to offer a support model which is going                                 to fit what you want to do they're going                                 and offering a more tiered support model                                 I think leaves an organization a lot                                 more open so that's that risk and that's                                 actually what some of our competitors do                                 do in that space but I also think as                                 well I think there isn't a single answer                                 to any of this it depends on the project                                 I mean we're quite lucky with Apache                                 CloudStack because it's been around for                                 nine years and it's in the plateau of                                 productivity nobody pays a lot of                                 attention to which we we've hated for                                 the last nine years but actually                                 commercially has been great for the last                                 few years for us because it's not like                                 every take OpenStack and                                 turn ative every vendor Under the Sun                                 everybody wanted to build an open stacks                                 services business five years ago nobody                                 was watching a patchy cloud stack and                                 from a business perspective ultimately                                 that's a good thing because we don't                                 have all of those those vendors but you                                 know it depends on the project I think                                 there isn't a single answer we were                                 quite a few companies that are                                 traditionally already open source like                                 elastic but we were also working for                                 some companies that's trying to adopt                                 open source which would what we really                                 like to stress with a lot of those                                 companies or with those new companies                                 that is that they're experts in the                                 field and that's for them is sometimes                                 still the difficult concepts you know                                 then that they're best at what they do                                 so also do seeing the real Freight you                                 know of getting into open source because                                 then what will happen to my brand you                                 know can we really still exist as this                                 you know what they formerly were as a                                 proprietary business and I think one of                                 the challenges you know that I really                                 see is that the kind of waiting until                                 everything is ready what we are trying                                 to do all the times you push them you                                 know come on guys you can do this one                                 step at a time it's not I mean we do                                 have two very different kinds of clients                                 so some that are really open source are                                 really used to it and still you know for                                 the for the guys you know one of the                                 things that I also think no makes a like                                 from the first question it's what really                                 makes companies go go towards open                                 source is that everything else is open                                 source so what else can you do you know                                 then then really start with that so not                                 as a competitive advantage but almost as                                 a well we have to otherwise yeah they're                                 kind of infected you know by at least                                 the company I work with it's in open                                 networking and then everything around it                                 is you know there's so many projects you                                 see the next foundation really adopting                                 open networking then they really look                                 okay there's no other choice they kind                                 of have to open source yeah yeah so I                                 work for IBM which has a long and sordid                                 history                                 have a relationship with open-source                                 early supporters of Apache Software                                 Foundation early supporters of Linux but                                 also longtime sellers and of you know                                 db                                                               solutions                                 I was hired on to be an open-source                                 evangelist and my experience which IBM                                 such a big company if anybody's watching                                 um it could be entirely different and                                 these are my opinions not the companies                                 but the goat the strategies been you                                 know developers at really really large                                 companies want to start moving to                                 open-source it is just that's the way                                 the winds are blowing um when you get to                                 the the higher level of the c-suite the                                 the older people in the company the                                 decision-makers they're a are hesitant                                 to do that um I don't know I I be M has                                 a lot of open source projects but                                 usually aren't what we're trying to use                                 in sell what we are selling is we can                                 come in and look there's a huge name                                 we're selling you a bunch of proprietary                                 stuff we'll just work this into the                                 service level agreement and we'll tack                                 on some open source on the side but if                                 anything ever goes wrong you can call us                                 because we will throw enough money at it                                 to solve your problem it doesn't matter                                 what's going you we you can't break IBM                                 and our service our contract will we'll                                 take a loss because we're not gonna let                                 that happen so that's yeah it's a                                 different I think angle from some of the                                 smaller startups it's just a unique                                 perspective I kind of wanted to toss in                                 that it's it's it's I know it's a                                 different tack but yeah to add to that I                                 mean the history of Copan or roots back                                 with Rafa and I have to admit that we                                 also occasionally take a loss based on                                 doing the support and I think if you if                                 you compare especially the smaller                                 products or the smaller projects with                                 the larger projects or larger companies                                 then you will realize that that is one                                 of the differentiators why people                                 actually                                 choose two smaller ones this is that the                                 support generally speaking is running                                 really well because and that's actually                                 the value that you sell it's not just                                 okay we can help you but it's also the                                 type of to speak the type of the type of                                  help right so you have a lot of                                  commercial vendors which say yeah you                                  have phone support or email support but                                  not phone support and then there are                                  others                                  that's an extra right and in in general                                  I think it's it's not a bad thing at all                                  to sort of let's call it commoditize an                                  open-source product that's actually what                                  we do we have a product and this product                                  is basically like sold we don't sell the                                  software as it is obviously but because                                  we're talking open-source here but                                  people don't want to buy a product which                                  just it's like when you get a car right                                  you just take the car you're off the lot                                  and then it's your deal and what we do                                  is is they actually we give you service                                  we whenever you break down we help you                                  and that that's the whole idea behind of                                  it and you have to be good at it right                                  otherwise you wouldn't come back and say                                  hey I like this vendor I like this and                                  that's it so that's that's the big how                                  how can you protect it on the other hand                                  well on cloud and X cloud to be honest                                  was not really the best from an outer                                  objective perspective what happened                                  because that's the power of forking                                  right but on the other hand if you know                                  the backgrounds of this whole                                  development then it was a very good                                  decision even though it it's it                                  generated a lot of air let's call it                                  that way but well I think for for                                  business of course one of the advantages                                  of open-source that was mentioned is                                  that it makes sure that the product is                                  around you're not locked in of course                                  what happens with um clouds going                                  bankrupt including shows that didn't                                  matter there were even two companies                                  after you know on cloud Inc went bust so                                  yeah I would indeed think that it's a                                  good thing but of course from an                                  investment perspective it was perhaps a                                  bit scary well I wanted to also say on                                  your slide part of the way that you get                                  people to renew the contracts is by                                  continuing to innovate right if it's                                  hard for other people to come in because                                  as you introduce new concepts and new                                  features into the software then they are                                  always a step behind right so third                                  parties can't come in and support your                                  stuff as well as the people who did the                                  work and there are always in catch-up                                  mode and that really hurts them actually                                  yeah and so it gives you a huge                                  competitive advantage to to be the ones                                  innovating the the core of the product                                  we have someone to fill one of these                                  chairs a lease so many MIT questions                                  maybe for someone on the panel or wants                                  to bring something else up otherwise                                  please please come just come to the                                  front even for one question please                                  please question just sit for a minute                                  sitting is killing us all you just                                  extended your life five seconds just ask                                  the question no I was just interested if                                  the open source project or code that                                  you're using to make business out of it                                  that somehow they decided to go in a                                  direction that you see that's                                  contradicting or will hurt you                                  business-wise how how you if any of you                                  had this was a situation and how did you                                  tackle it so if you have a conflict                                  between the community and a director                                  community wants to go and the company                                  think it's a really good question and                                  I'm sure there are people here who have                                  answers                                  yeah and in short words every day the                                  the thing how we tackle it and again                                  we're doing this for over ten years now                                  is prioritizing please don't get the                                  impression if there's a customer it                                  automatically has higher priority than a                                  community member that doesn't work that                                  way the prioritization goes but effect                                  is is how impactful is this forward for                                  all users right so some of the the                                  things that came along from the                                  community are really also hurting                                  customers so it was important to us to                                  say hey this needs to get in and so the                                  prioritization is based more on the                                  issue or on a bug or on the feature                                  whatever and has nothing to do at all                                  with a community versus company the only                                  level that you have as a company which                                  well you have two levels one thing is is                                  that obviously the more important but                                  that's natural business thing more                                  important a customer is the more you're                                  inclined to provide essentially a little                                  bit more resources to it right so that                                  you say hey guys we're talking here                                  million dollar customer we really need                                  to make sure that he is happy right                                  that's one side of it but the other side                                  of it is also and that's the great part                                  about open source i mean you as you                                  mentioned you want to innovate the                                  product because only when you innovate                                  the product you get people to renew they                                  want to see that the product is moving                                  on you want to see that support is going                                  on if that all is good then they will                                  renew and everyone is happy but there                                  are also customers which come in and say                                  like I need this button and blue and you                                  have your product in green and it says                                  like this looks stupid we won't do this                                  I mean then he says well you know what                                  we pay X ma X Y Z for it and then you                                  say like okay you know what we can do it                                  just for you in your environment and                                  this is done by a completely separate                                  team right so they did this is like                                  professional services and and so on and                                  they'll do it for you and but don't                                  expect us                                  to merge this back into the core product                                  because if we do so every other customer                                  would say we're nuts right so that's                                  that's the that's the core thing of it                                  and actually this is something that is                                  really let's call it the VIP service for                                  special customers but it's really                                  completely aside from the development if                                  you mix that up you end up being a                                  consulting company and developing your                                  product into being a customer driven                                  thing and that's absolutely not what I                                  know we we partially have been there                                  long years ago it's not a good idea                                  don't do it well as always with software                                  you need to listen to what your                                  customers actually need not what they                                  say they want and give them something                                  that fits with the architecture so                                  absolutely your customers are critical                                  for assigning your own resources but                                  with open source projects especially the                                  ones that you don't dominate you're                                  going to get other stuff coming in so of                                  course the community provides other                                  stuff which is a good thing and your                                  customers will take that and use it so                                  you the challenge there is that you need                                  to make the managers understand yes you                                  need to rebase and spend engineering                                  effort to get some of those new features                                  coming in you can't stay on a fork from                                  two years ago right and so that's always                                  a struggle but you have to pay that cost                                  and convince the managers who aren't in                                  open source right there they're just                                  managing the company priorities that                                  it's a critical part of what they do and                                  so IBM who again may or may not have a                                  great perceptions in the community all                                  of the committers and PMC's on strategic                                  projects have their own little death                                  unit that no one can touch it's an                                  office in San Francisco and that is to                                  prevent anyone from having any being not                                  persuaded incentivized or having the                                  idea to even try they have their own                                  management chain and no one can touch                                  them and that and they just because we                                  do want to contribute to the community                                  we want to have that isolation that                                  firewall that's how we prevent anyone                                  from calling in who's a big customer                                  it's a conscience yeah I mean so that's                                  that's another I guess just tactic for                                  keeping that division of yeah I think                                  they call it the division of church and                                  state which this does anyone here have                                  experience how this is in an open core                                  company so if you have a open source                                  product with proprietary Adams because                                  then you can see community members who                                  want to develop features that are                                  proprietary atoms and therefore undercut                                  your company my life I've seen this in                                  the past we're completely open so we                                  don't face that part but we've dealt                                  with projects where they're dominated by                                  company that is open core and yeah it                                  really sucks because when you try to put                                  that feature in they pull push back of                                  course and then you need to say okay                                  well either do this on our own and in                                  added work of fork effectively or                                  additional work of their addition but it                                  basically sucks Holden who is also                                  running around here we were talking                                  about this a couple years ago at an                                  Apache gun and her solution was it was                                  something and with I don't know it was                                  some sort of streaming thing we I was                                  working on and she said well then just                                  make crazy Bob's house of streaming and                                  just keep going on that and eventually                                  they'll try to merge you back in and                                  they'll take your stuff but yeah dude                                  the reality which we could face with oh                                  we've been open core before the thing is                                  it hurts the product it hurt it hurts                                  the open source part so for us we had                                  the luck that moppy is not an intrusive                                  technology so you really need time to                                  get into it but therefore basically                                  locking out others from easily forking                                  let's go that way                                  but the reality is is                                  when you have this open core model then                                  from a natural business perspective you                                  try to you know to to rub the jewels                                  right you you want to make them nicer                                  and shinier and just add some more tools                                  to it but the crown under it is is just                                  rusting and that's exactly the problem                                  what happens when you go open core I                                  might add something from a different                                  perspective we have actually given up                                  producing our own products by now so                                  we're basically I'm working for ktab so                                  we're providing consultancy historically                                  mainly on cute or cutie so this is where                                  we're basically taking the other                                  perspective so we have the question how                                  don't we cannibalize the the cute                                  business model because obviously we our                                  services rely on them and and this this                                  relationship between our company                                  providing the the consulting we're also                                  the second largest sort of external                                  committer to the project so I mean this                                  is the typical question our our                                  customers have like we're running into                                  this very serious problem here we can't                                  solve it ourselves so please go ahead                                  and do it and yeah this this this kind                                  of relation from the other perspective                                  we we do want a healthy cutie yeah                                  because this is what we sort of live                                  from but this is this is also from the                                  other perspective it's not it's not easy                                  we've we've tried a lot of things but                                  it's it's like we we try to sell                                  licenses for them because we do have                                  customers so we try to get our share on                                  that but that sort of start cute to fear                                  about their business model on the other                                  hand they are starting you know to                                  provide services on consulting because                                  obviously they want to grow which on the                                  other hand on our side will say oh well                                  if they are now starting you know                                  consulting then what about our business                                  model so this is this is I don't have a                                  solution to it it's an ongoing struggle                                  over the years yeah but it's it's it's                                  really a vital question how to how to                                  have this lively and healthy this                                  relationship                                  a relationship where multiple companies                                  can actually contribute I mean something                                  like OpenStack of course I've managed to                                  do that I mean it's possible but it's                                  different                                  well the cute community manages as well                                  I'm just saying this is it is hard work                                  from both sides all of the time I mean                                  there are the competitors on the market                                  to also contribute to cute and they are                                  basically in the same situation as we                                  are yeah all right                                  maybe it's time for the next question                                  unless someone else wants to bring                                  something in it's not then we move on to                                  the next point let's refresh the panel                                  and welcome to join again okay so a bit                                  of a change of theme with funding and                                  raising venture capital funding or from                                  other private investors in order to get                                  you know what do they call it a hyper                                  growth and in order to compete with                                  other startups in a particular sector                                  funding is often a critical ingredient                                  and we had an intense debate some of                                  people news from last night around the                                  pros and cons and the challenges that                                  open source firms face but it seems to                                  me it's much harder for open source                                  firms to raise venture capital like for                                  like I'm thinking about early-stage                                  firms at this point but I'd really love                                  to hear experience from anybody who's                                  actually tried pitching an open-source                                  business or business model whether the                                  product whatever stage the product was                                  at and and how that went what kind of                                  reactions you you got so that's first of                                  all have a show of hands anybody                                  successfully raised funds for their open

                       experienced or seen                                  semi-closed how to do it yeah can I ask                                  you to join the panel at the back thank                                  you and yeah please and by the way if                                  you've tried but it didn't work                                  yeah anybody trying and not succeed yet

admit                                  okay good good thank you for being brave                                  enough to talk about that the                                  unsuccessful ones too can I give some                                  some microphones around                                  I've actually been only involved it sort                                  of arm's length I haven't been in front                                  of any Vesey's both with a successful                                  and an unsuccessful project in the case                                  of the successful project it was because                                  it was based on the humanitarian free                                  open-source project that the investor                                  had been supporting up to that point and                                  it was a pitch to thee and to the                                  investor to say we would like to make                                  this self-sustaining by building a                                  business on it so it was who is the                                  investor investing whether he's not                                  saying at this point okay but are they                                  are they a typical type of VC they                                  specialize in humanitarian products it's                                  just a very rich person favorite so they                                  were supporting the project for for that                                  philanthropic reason yes exactly so                                  originally he was supporting the project                                  because he believes in it and he still                                  supports the project because he believes                                  in it but he's not going to live forever                                  and he knows that and he would like the                                  project to continue and so he was                                  looking for ways to make that happen and                                  one suggestion was to make a company                                  for-profit based on this humanitarian                                  mission so a social entrepreneurship                                  and he has invested quite a bit actually                                  in the company based on that mission the                                  next project that I worked on that                                  didn't succeed just like if you talk to                                  a lot of people and you don't get money                                  and they're not very open about why so I                                  mean you get like it's a great idea and                                  like well then do you do you feel or                                  suspect that open source played a                                  particular role in that decision it                                  could be                                  I don't like there's a lot of                                  possibilities um and if it's open source                                  and it's hard to to say how you                                  differentiate yourself and from existing                                  or future potential competitors on the                                  market people like VCS what to earn a                                  lot of money that's kind of what they're                                  in it for and if there's a low profit                                  margin or a low potential profit margin                                  because somebody else is going to get in                                  on it and compete right away then they                                  just don't get in would you share your                                  experiences I've had several experiences                                  and if I can sum up in running an                                  opportunist if you want to pitch PCs you                                  can only get money if you don't actually                                  need it's really so that would give you                                  the money for growth but if you actually                                  need money to actually launch your                                  company you would not find them there's                                  another thing I had in mind which is                                  this is actually they invest money to                                  resell the shares so they want to create                                  an assets literally they want to create                                  something that they own and they don't                                  really like the idea that they don't own                                  on that open source software is not                                  owned is something you share it's not                                  something you own it's not a property                                  you own and may ask this is particular                                  feedback you've received like are these                                  comments that oh yeah yes specific                                  feedback and experience and time and                                  ones oh wait no don't energy lost in                                  trying to do that effort and you felt it                                  and and so if the same model the same                                  pitch that you've been making was for                                  the same product but with                                  proprietary license you feel the outcome                                  but I would say it's several things I                                  would say it also depends on what DC                                  community you're talking about I have a                                  specific experience with the French                                  environment and there you have people                                  that behave more like bankers or fund                                  managers and they don't want to risk any                                  money I mean they be seized with no risk                                  the risk of this is a bit harsh to this                                  but it's long time and if you spend                                  there I would say that you you do have                                  saved on the way so school not North                                  America this is that to have more vision                                  and more likely to gamble on so so you                                  have those won't gamble those no wanna                                  gamble that but what I want to say but                                  assets and property is something else I                                  realized from from the VC community                                  where they meet the academic community                                  somewhere because in universities or                                  research industry Institute's they also                                  want to create assets IPSS that they                                  want to sell and you have the same kind                                  of reaction where people want to have                                  these kind of IP assets that they want                                  to be able to resell to monetize at some                                  point and when you pitch them with an                                  open source business model it's not that                                  what you sell you don't sell the asset                                  you sell custom ownership you sell your                                  customer base and that's where the value                                  is really just to finish that point can                                  I could I ask where what happened in the                                  end of this story so after you had these                                  experiences no that's about several                                  experiences and some some gotten money                                  and some didn't get the money so you did                                  successfully raise funds in some cases                                  for your yes yes and was it was it I                                  mean differences between the failures                                  and successes was it something changed                                  in your case no it was the thing is you                                  could raise money if you really have a                                  customer base or flow of orders rent and                                  when you don't see in in the end the                                  lesson is you get the money if you don't                                  need it can I ask how you funded getting                                  to the point where you didn't need it                                  how did you how did you get to the point                                  of being cashflow positive or having a                                  community was large enough to                                  demonstrate the value I'm spending and                                  having and signing a few customers and                                  building up a credible                                  customer base and prospect of critical                                  prospects at least thank you                                  perhaps you'd like to share your                                  experience yes I've raised money for a                                  number of businesses at different stages                                  of those businesses and I agree                                       going and getting seed money initially                                  hey here's my business plan I'm gonna                                  make you lots of money is not impossible                                  I think is a it's a red herring specific                                  leave open source it's a red herring                                  that open source and open source doesn't                                  really matter it's well in my employ in                                  my experiences have you got a good                                  business plan do they trust you to                                  deliver that business plan have you got                                  any credibility in previously delivering                                  that spreadsheets and the fact you don't                                  own the IP outright or you're at the                                  same degree of control in an open source                                  case doesn't make a difference in your                                  records you know what it depends what                                  the business model is around open source                                  so going to to raise money with you know                                  I'm planning to build a support business                                  around a Apache project is a completely                                  different thing to I'm gonna build a new                                  engine which is going to sit underneath                                  Cuban eighties you know that they're two                                  completely in which of those have you                                  tried the support model both ah so                                  actually my current camera showed blue                                  we I was in a very fortunate position                                  that I was effectively the seed capital                                  because I just exited a previous                                  business and we we haven't had to do any                                  further funding rounds but I've been on                                  the advisory board of a number of                                  companies where we've had to go and get                                  them some initial funding some angel                                  funding and a lot of that comes down to                                  trying to find somebody who understands                                  the space somebody who is probably                                  working in that space he's just sold                                  their own startup that that sort of                                  thing but you know trying to go                                  institutionally and ask for Sica if                                  you're not know and if you haven't                                  proven that you can do this a few times                                  round one once you have a running visit                                  it doesn't necessarily have to be                                  cashflow positive but once you're in the                                  situation that you know you have                                  traction for your product you are                                  demonstrating your business plan is                                  moving in the right direction that                                  becomes a whole                                  easily a conversation and most from                                  experience most of the institutional                                  investors certainly in London where I am                                  a lot of them are closely related to                                  Silicon Valley companies a lot of them                                  are Silicon Valley companies with the                                  London offices they completely get this                                  okay                                  they understand open source they                                  understand the technology they have you                                  know people in residents who have come                                  out of a lot of these projects so                                  certainly don't be scared by that they                                  understand it and they embrace the                                  concept semster completely completely I                                  I might say I don't know if red herrings                                  have ever just in English terms it but                                  it's a yeah I think it's a misconception                                  - it's over playing it too much to say                                  open source is the big thing here that's                                  almost on page                                                            Hortonworks of course we had the huge                                  advantage that brought Bearden was at                                  entry at a venture capital firm right he                                  was at benchmark and so he knew what he                                  wanted in an open source company and                                  that was a huge leg up the other                                  advantage that it comes from it saying                                  you're going to do an open source                                  company especially for a project that's                                  already successful in meeting customer's                                  needs is that you've already distributed                                  just demonstrated that that community is                                  there right you're solving real problems                                  with real code and so if you can take                                  that and say ok we're going to leverage                                  that community you're a huge step up on                                  someone who just has a slide deck right                                  and that that's actually a huge huge                                  point I totally agree so huge advantage                                  so just just to clarify damage for open                                  source companies is that you've already                                  demonstrated that you've got a usable                                  product that's helping people solve real                                  problems Thanks from from the point                                  I have to I have to intervene with with                                  the open-source part that there is no                                  differentiator the problem for and just                                  a little background                                  I've personally not made any direct vc                                  deal but i assisted and many and let's                                  call it this way I know many wealthy                                  people that can help in that area so the                                  thing is is as the the thinking of a VC                                  is that he wants to have the highest                                  possible gain at the lowest possible                                  risk so the lowest possible risk                                  nowadays is not that that important                                  anymore and which is good for                                  open-source actually but because we've                                  got more risk to deal with is that the                                  problem is just a general market at the                                  moment the interest rates are everywhere                                  down so basically investors try to find                                  places where to put their money in and                                  the problem is is you know when you when                                  you have it's it's like on a stock                                  market if you have something where you                                  know hey this is secure your interest                                  rate is low but if you want to take                                  chance your possibilities are endless so                                  the thing is is with open source there                                  are certain B C's in the world which                                  understand open source right Andy                                  bechtolsheim is a perfect example of                                  that right he really knows what he's                                  talking about he really knows open                                  source he knows the mentality and he                                  knows the benefits of it because that                                  just that you're doing open source                                  doesn't mean that you cannot materialize                                  a business out of it Red Hat and others                                  are perfect examples for that but the                                  major problem is is that when you and                                  that's that ties in with your point when                                  you want to when when you want to run a                                  business that has the core of open                                  source you need proof                                  you need proof of it and that is only                                  something that you can do by community                                  by cus proof of what specifically proof                                  of that the product works that no hope                                  of a business model no the proof of                                  business model cannot be proven in any                                  way I mean that's the idea of a business                                  plan right it gives you a path and you                                  can think like yeah that sounds like a                                  good bet or not but the the only proof                                  that you can have and that's where we're                                  open source really where really has a                                  big advantage actually is is this that                                  you can prove and say like                                  I have this user base I have like                                      developers in the back they know what                                  they're doing they had also the team                                  part is also a big aspect                                                developers you mean yes                                                                                                            installations running in production this                                  is important stuff because they know hey                                  I can monetize that because I know you                                  know I as a VC and then have the option                                  to say hey this is something I want to a                                  monetize B I can develop C I know it's                                  really a need so I see the target group                                  which I can approach and grow but they                                  will never own the IPO in the same sorry                                  the IP way to the others would but and                                  that's the big thing here when you have                                  an open-source product that does not                                  mean that you automatically have the the                                  knowledge to maintain it obviously an on                                  cloud next card this thing was very                                  special because a lot of people from the                                  own cloud team fort basically their own                                  project and this is a this is obviously                                  a logistical fear from from a VC but the                                  reality is it's the larger the community                                  is the harder it actually is executed I                                  don't want to name any projects here but                                  there are even in the office area good                                  examples of how a fork can also not run                                  too well let's call that way there are                                  there are also areas where look in a                                  security area and in the encryption area                                  the thing is is you need traction you                                  need base and when you get that then you                                  at least have higher chances the same                                  Florian departed I think he'd have                                  something to say can we just take the                                  last two just about so I'm in a hundred                                  percent agreement with you they have my                                  point around it doesn't really matter as                                  open sources we framed this from the                                  context of looking for problems with                                  open source and raising money I'm saying                                  it is not a problem it's only a positive                                  and it's only a positive in terms of you                                  know we talk about minimum minimum                                  viable product etc normally when you're                                  raising money around open source you're                                  already there you have the community you                                  have customers even if they aren't                                  paying cost                                  that's right there people who are using                                  the software and yet when we look at the                                  number of companies which are so you                                  know providing only open source                                  solutions which are valued at a billion                                  dollars or more or have received                                      million dollars in venture capital                                  investment or more it's a we're talking                                  about ten fingers more money you know                                  like it's it's with tiny tiny numbers                                  there's a big global economic question                                  fair enough                                  can we take the like the last point from                                  you know everything very important is                                  that the basics of VC funding still                                  apply to any open source businesses                                  which is the team and they're really                                  investing the team so it's not just                                  about technology you could have a very                                  bright guy in technologies I have myself                                  lost a lot of money with four very                                  bright guys who suddenly disappeared and                                  played Devers and the thing is you need                                  to have people who are committed to                                  building that as a real business so in                                  the challenges of pachinko commercial                                  businesses you really need to have the                                  team and the more experienced and now we                                  have people pitching VC's who've been                                  through several generations of several                                  companies like for instance in your case                                  you've been through so you have the                                  experience and that's a lot of                                  credibility now the other thing is you                                  need to have the whole the what you've                                  mentioned already covered all radio but                                  product decisions and scan your business                                  modular scales because you can have a                                  very bright tech technology team that                                  can develop something but it's all but                                  they say execution so these all the                                  basics all the basics the                                            funding totally applies to open source                                  with maybe a little pinch of difficulty                                  but also of interest because you have to                                  figure out that open source is much more                                  in the mainstream has got so much more                                  in the mainstream over the last five six                                  years I mean when the opens that I could                                  open and know that and probably with AI                                  this new wave of things coming up all                                  right I guess that is note on which we                                  and I found interesting you point that                                  maybe there aren't just enough people                                  have done it before there's not enough                                  experience that's at least one way of                                  thinking that we just have to keep                                  trying as community and suddenly there                                  will be more Red Hat's                                  someday so we're at the end of our time                                  I mean people for the next talk I think                                  are already coming in                                  it would be really great if you could                                  all help quickly to put the chairs back                                  because you know we made a mess and                                  thank you for meditation really                                  appreciate it                                  [Applause]
