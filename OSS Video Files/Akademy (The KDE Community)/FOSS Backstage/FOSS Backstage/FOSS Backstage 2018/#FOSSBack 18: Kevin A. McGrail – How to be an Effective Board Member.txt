slides                               were later on covered it but for those                               of you don't know me you know I go by my                               initials cam I worked on the Apache                               spamassassin project for the last two                               decades and I particularly love this                               picture because basically I'm off-brand                                Canadian spam apparently so alright                                first disclaimer you know I sit on a lot                                of boards I do a lot of different work                                and this talk is not specifically about                                the ASF though I'm here on behalf the                                ASF where I work as an executive officer                                so alright so first rule for being on a                                board member and being effective so

                     people can really benefit from these                                tips that I've gained over you know                                   years is start with a volunteer board                                and that will get you the experience you                                need how to be an effective board member                                to work up to it in a career level                                because that's really how you can take                                your career to the highest level so tip                                number one learn from other people's                                mistakes one of my favorite books and                                it's actually been rediscovered recently                                it's getting more press in business                                colleges and whatnot but it's the                                Dilbert principle written by Scott Adams                                same guy who writes the comic strips but                                basically what he's done is in his is in                                his work and doing the comic strips                                people would write him stories about how                                many dumb things occurred at their                                companies and he took all of the                                knowledge and basically condensed it                                down along with his own experience and                                produced a business book about                                management principles and I really                                highly recommend it so alright business                                is like a marriage so this is something                                I try and really drive home for people                                who are on a board you have to pick your                                board you have to pick the people that                                are on it very carefully pick your                                partner's carefully on the board                                don't pick multiple partners for a                                marriage that will definitely not not                                work but the thing that I often say is                                that if                                                              imagine how many businesses fail and how                                many boards fail to be effective is it's                                quite a bit                                higher so set things up for the fact                                that you need tiebreakers you need                                people who are good at debate and good                                at discussion so that it doesn't become                                the you know an onerous bad task one of                                my favorite things for meetings I will                                not attend an immediate without an                                agenda and it's a great tip now you can                                write an agenda for me that literally                                says this meeting has no agenda you know                                that is acceptable to me but by having                                an agenda you really can streamline the                                meeting people know what to expect                                people show up prepared for the meeting                                and you know part of that preparation is                                when of the meeting is going to occur                                and one of the biggest tips that I give                                for nonprofits and for corporations                                alike is don't try and meet everybody's                                schedule if you try and go through your                                calendars and say oh I can meet it                                Monday at noon no that doesn't work for                                me Tuesday at                                                           work just pick something often you know                                noon on every third Wednesday of the                                month things like that set times it will                                work its way out people will be able to                                set it ahead a set aside the time and it                                works on a long-term basis and when you                                do that keep and review the minutes from                                the last meeting but minutes are really                                important to who made a decision who is                                attending it doesn't have to be really                                onerous but it really helps especially                                with some of the things we're going to                                talk about which are things like passing                                the baton and getting other people in                                there so that they can figure out who                                made the decision who oh who ran that                                conference three years ago oh I know who                                to go talk to and ask them a question                                 about it the little things in there can                                 really pay off later on and it also                                 gives you an opportunity to record                                 action items who's taking care of stuff                                 so it's in there so people before the                                 next meeting because you've got an                                 agenda and you've got a set time they                                 can look at it and go oh crap I forgot                                 I'm supposed to take care of that issue                                 that I didn't do and they can get it                                 done they get it's basically the                                 homework assignments next mailing lists                                 you know using mailing lists correctly                                 so at the ASF you know we talked about                                 the fact that we're we're a meritocracy                                 some people tongue-in-cheek call some                                 may-lah cracy talking both about the                                 male domination and the IT field but                                 also about the fact that we want to do                                 everything on a mailing                                 they're great they're really really good                                 for things like planning they're great                                 for records I send all the after reports                                 etc they're not always so great for                                 discussions sometimes you get asked the                                 same question                                                          very frustrating when that happens but                                 one of the biggest things that I like to                                 bring up is the fact that email as a                                 medium as a way to communicate is very                                 very cold and there's a great article                                 that came out in Wired and I think this                                 came out yeah                                                           basically did is it went over a                                 psychology report from a well-respected                                 journal and what it talks about is the                                 fact that                                                              tone of the person who wrote the email                                 so basically you you can roll dice you                                 know it's a flip of the coin as to                                 whether or not you know what that                                 person's tone was when they email was                                 written were they angry were they happy                                 where they you know you're just guessing                                 so you can't really ever read into                                 anybody's tone but the interesting thing                                 about this study that it also had was                                 that people thought and I think it was a                                 T know                                                                 people thought they knew the tone of the                                 email but only                                                           right so really great article take a                                 look at it all right this one is one                                 that unfortunately shows my age a little                                 bit this was a great topic that was used                                 a long time ago back in like                                        think was when it was first really kind                                 of shaped up actually on Usenet for                                 anybody hold enough to remember us-- net                                 this came out of the forums for the                                 dating forms like rec dating I think is                                 whatever I came from but the the acronym                                 was you know DNF tec you know do not                                 feed the energy creature and so this is                                 something you have to realize there are                                 people that feed off of other people's                                 energy and one of my favorite examples                                 about this he's a good friend and he's                                 he's learned he's not as much of a jerk                                 as he was when he was younger but                                 imagine if you will he would log on to a                                 religious board and just post something                                 like there is no God and then log out                                 and never log on ever again knowing that                                 that just does there's like                                       threads that started in responses that                                 came out of his work so be careful of                                 that don't feed into people's energy                                 think about when you're responding to                                 something like that you know is it worth                                 the battle is it worth what they're                                 doing are they trying to                                 you've something or are they just                                 feeding off energy all right streamline                                 your meetings so the Apache foundation                                 is a really great example of how to                                 streamline your meetings we have you                                 know set agendas we have set dates and                                 times we've had the same date and time I                                 think for close to                                              but on top of that we have some great                                 tooling that's built on top of revision                                 controlling systems                                 it's called whimsy and whimsy Apache org                                 is the project it's one of our top level                                 projects and we're looking for other                                 organizations that want to use it but                                 it's basically how we do all over                                 reports how our chair runs the meeting                                 and everything and anything so at Apache                                 if you ask how do I do XYZ a good fount                                 of the time the answer is go to whimsy                                 and it's taken care of there so you know                                 what lets you use shared agendas you                                 don't have to use windy to do that but                                 on top of that you can keep shared notes                                 and minutes these techniques and we'll                                 talk about some of the other ways you                                 can use it you achieve this besides                                 whimsy but you know they're important                                 tasks all right I'll take a little break                                 for a moment so I have some quizzes how                                 many people are old enough to remember                                 emoticons that predated emojis anyway                                 okay all right anybody anybody want to                                 guess what this one is this is a cat                                 this one same cat after getting run over                                 by a car okay this one this is me in a                                 tie so if you turn sideways it's easier                                 so don't hurt your neck cat all right so                                 the next thing I really try and focus on                                 and this is something that sometimes                                 surprises people that are joining a                                 board a lot is general corporate                                 oversight and so some people don't know                                 the concept of a corporate veil but if                                 you think about it like why does a                                 corporation exist why don't we for                                 example just start doing business                                 without bothering with this                                 incorporation and all this other process                                 well basically the the concept behind it                                 is that you're creating an entity so                                 that you're protected personally so what                                 the company does and what you do aren't                                 necessarily the same thing                                 and that's called a corporate veil veil                                 or a corporate umbrella and so there's a                                 link on this and the slides will be up                                 on the website but it talks about how to                                 protect yourself how to not get you know                                 how did not pierce the corporate veil                                 how to not get yourself in trouble for                                 something your company does and there's                                 some basic things on this for example                                 like business                                                      business they'll tell you every time you                                 sign a contractor you sign any piece of                                 paper it's signed with your your                                 signature your name and your title and                                 the title makes it say you're signing on                                 behalf of the company and that means                                 you're signing on behalf of that entity                                 that you set up it's a very important                                 concept that people have to understand                                 because that's when things like                                 insurance mechanisms and things like                                 directors and officers insurance can                                 protect you if you sign it personally                                 you need personal insurance not the                                 corporate insurance but on top of that                                 some of the things you can do in the US                                 for example you can add what's called a                                 director as an officers writer so if                                 you're doing nonprofit work you can add                                 a rider to your home insurance quite                                 often that will protect you on some of                                 these cases and if there's a lawsuit on                                 things like that                                 additionally something that catches a                                 lot of people by surprise especially in                                 the current era of things like gdpr                                 they're very surprised to find out that                                 officer and director and employee                                 information especially highly                                 compensated employees is public                                 information so people don't always like                                 that they're very surprised to find out                                 that oh they go search their name on the                                 internet and up come some various tax                                 documents for various countries so that                                 catches some people by surprise and                                 finally and this is something I'm very                                 strong about a CEO ID it                                              conflict of interest disclosure you know                                 and refusals is when you basically don't                                 vote on something I don't always require                                 that people recuse themselves from a                                 vote especially if they have gone to the                                 extra trouble of announcing their                                 conflicts of interest                                 everybody has conflicts of interest it's                                 really comes down to how they're handled                                 whether they acknowledge they exist and                                 how they make sure that they aren't                                 interfering with their decision so                                 pretty good important stuff all right                                 debate so one of my favorite quotes with                                 being on a board is for Martin Luther                                 King jr. and it basically just says                                 agree to disagree without being                                 disagreeable you're not going to                                 convince everybody everybody is                                 different and can                                 really isn't always possible and so at                                 the end of the day sometimes you just                                 have to agree that you're not going to                                 come to a consensus and you move on and                                 the second part of that is really kind                                 of pick your battles if it's something                                 silly you know try and keep some                                 distance from the issue at hand you know                                 if it's a silly minor issue let the                                 debate die down go with the consensus                                 honor the will of the board and the                                 other people who voted on it and and let                                 it go if it's something bigger that you                                 feel strongly about you know use that as                                 a time to battle and if you do that                                 you'll have more you'll have more                                 understanding from the board when all of                                 a sudden you really start to fight                                 something because they'll understand                                 that oh you know you don't normally make                                 a big deal and you're making a big deal                                 about this perhaps we should take a                                 second and rethink what we've just                                 decided on all right                                 transparency succession and ink so                                 really these these three tenants they                                 kind of go together and the reason they                                 do is that especially on a non-profit                                 we're going to talk a little bit about                                 volunteerism and burnout but you need to                                 plan for your the succession who's going                                 to pick up the baton after you and                                 there's a great presentation from last                                 year that's linked down at the bottom                                 that was about passing the baton but if                                 you share everything if you write stuff                                 down if you start before you even do a                                 task by writing the policy or writing                                 the SOP standard operating procedure for                                 how you're going to do that task it                                 makes the next person who does that task                                 do it better it also you know I find it                                 helps me a lot many years ago I was                                 lucky I had a friend of mine who you                                 know pointed out to me when I was                                 forgetting some stuff a Chinese proverb                                 and it basically says the faintest ink                                 is better than the brightest memory and                                 you know the the much simpler version is                                 just write down you won't forget it                                 it's right in front of you and it helps                                 so month to month you can make things                                 happen so one of the tools that I use                                 and I really like is Google Docs Google                                 sheets it's a great way to do things                                 like agendas and minutes and planning                                 documents if you have never used these                                 tools their power isn't necessarily                                 their amazing organization and                                 formatting things things like Microsoft                                 Word are amazing for that but the fact                                 that multiple people can work on the                                 document at the same exact time you end                                 up with                                 having an agenda prepared beforehand                                 everybody can look at it you do the                                 minutes in real time during the meeting                                 everybody can read them see if there's                                 errors etc and when you're done with the                                 meeting your minutes are done there's no                                 extra work for a secretary to go back                                 and organize the minutes send them out                                 with an email your meetings done you                                 have your records everything's good                                 alright good chairs this is probably one                                 of the biggest things that I like to                                 point out pick your chairs and think                                 about how they do it they need to be                                 somebody who's organized they need to be                                 fairly strong because they need to they                                 need to set discussion limits and that                                 can be both minimums and maximums they                                 need to try and encourage everybody to                                 talk about a topic they need to stop                                 people from talking about a topic                                 sometimes and you know get to a certain                                 point where decisions can be made and                                 that's the strength of a good chair is                                 to try and keep discussion going but                                 remember when we talked about conflicts                                 of it just interest disclosure there's                                 little things that chairs should do that                                 aren't always done for example a chair                                 as a general rule should not vote or if                                 they do vote they should vote last so                                 that they are not in they are not                                 influencing other people's vote unfairly                                 so the other thing I like to make sure                                 if the people avoid parliamentarian tip                                 tricks at the ASF Robert's Rules of                                 Order is kind of a bad word that's how a                                 lot of organizations run try and stay                                 away from it if you're using too much                                 parliamentarian tricks or you know point                                 of orders it's probably not a very                                 successful meeting it's probably not                                 going to be very fun it gets kind of old                                 after a while all right and then the                                 rule by consensus we already kind of                                 talked about a little bit promote                                 inclusion so this is kind of my big                                 topic for the last year after a fairly                                 you know unwelcome suggestion that women                                 weren't you know capable of working in                                 IT because of biological differences we                                 wanted to really focus on the fact that                                 at the the ASF we build on a concept                                 called meritocracy and you earn merit                                 based on the fact that you know how to                                 do something and it doesn't have                                 anything to do with age sex religion                                 country of origin sexual preference you                                 know socioeconomic status et cetera and                                 so you know that's one of the things we                                 do really hard to promote                                 is promoting inclusion but on top of                                 that we promote diversity and I saw this                                 quote recently on LinkedIn and it really                                 struck home that you know if you're in a                                 life raft and you know do you want                                 everybody in that life raft to have the                                 exact same skills you do and hopefully                                 the answer is no you don't and you know                                 I point out that you know when you watch                                 shows like Survivor where they put                                 people on an island it's usually like                                 this                                 mess of people having all these                                 conflicts and everything like that and                                 you know I compare it to like if you                                 know if they took the US Marines and put                                 them on Survivor by day three they                                 probably have a still running and have                                 built three buildings and you know etc                                 have an airstrip going in by day five so                                 yeah the point is is that they they                                 purposely look at skills and you look at                                 something like survivor they purposely                                 pick people with clashing skill sets or                                 clashing ideologies etc but at the end                                 of the day many hands make light work so                                 try and get other people to help and                                 promote people with skills other than                                 what you have so one of the jokes I like                                 to bring up a lot is one of my weird                                 skills that's on my resume that my son                                 asked me to add to a conference a couple                                 of weeks ago is I have worked as a                                 professional livestock painter you know                                 at Virginia Tech we got this idea that                                 we'd go out and tip cows it's not                                 possible so we instead got back a couple                                 of weeks later and decided to paint cows                                 we started painting Virginia Tech logos                                 on it and a rival University to us is                                 the University of Virginia so we painted                                 things such as UVA sucks on the Cal's                                 one day we were getting chased off by                                 the farmer there and he says stop stop                                 stop and were like we're sorry we                                 painted your cow and he said no no I                                 don't care about that he's like I want                                 to hire you to paint more cows because                                 we got like a hundred bucks extra at                                 auction for the cows you painted so and                                 I threw this dog thing in there for rich                                 so that's an Apache helicopter so                                 eventually if we get big enough and we                                 buy an Apache helicopter I can be the                                 one to paint the logo on it for him so                                 alright JFDI so this is an acronym that                                 some people might be familiar with but                                 basically it's just do it if                                 you're on a non a non-profit board many                                 times the biggest thing you can do is                                 step up to do something you know                                 especially at the ASF                                 we want people to step up we want to                                 give them room to explore and do what                                 they're doing hopefully with some                                 mentorship and some guidance on how to                                 do it some limits because one of the                                 things I say is there's three kinds of                                 people there's people with there's                                 people with ideas there's people with                                 ideas they want you to implement and                                 then there's people with ideas that they                                 want to implement and pretty much the                                 people with that they want other people                                 to implement they suck so if you have an                                 idea step up one of the things I talk                                 about it is ask for delegation ask for I                                 want to do this I need a budget to do                                 this I want permission to do this and on                                 top of that you know ask to be the                                 person who reports to the board so now                                 you've got delegation you've got a task                                 you've got a budget you can make                                 something happen                                 all right volunteer burnout so I won't                                 talk too much about this but it is                                 something to realize especially in the                                 volunteer world especially at an                                 open-source conference like this                                 volunteer burnout is a real thing it                                 happens and there's ways to fix it think                                 about things like consecutive term                                 limits think about making sure you're                                 sharing and delegating things and                                 probably the biggest thing that I tell                                 people to do is admit when there's a                                 problem early if you're running                                 something like a conference and you wait                                 till three days before the conference to                                 tell people that hey you were too ill to                                 do something or just you couldn't get it                                 done there's nothing anybody else can do                                 to help if you asked it three months                                 later earlier excuse me and you say look                                 I'm just I'm having a lot of problems I                                 can't take care of this I need help the                                 problems can be fixed and we're all                                 human we all have problems you know so                                 just step up and do that again some more                                 items there on that link there below as                                 well some more ideas for that my last                                 topic for today really is about                                 communication so you know especially                                 with email we talked about this a lot at                                 the ASF you know when when people                                 misunderstand what you're doing we work                                 around the world and so you know I said                                 you know do what I say not what I do you                                 know speak slowly it lets people                                 understand what's going on it lets                                 people who aren't English as a native                                 speaker or your particular language                                 understand things and there's some ideas                                 here about you know you know taming the                                 steamroller how not to just talk over                                 people and what's going on and also just                                 you know a wonderful site that in a                                 German native sent me that just how they                                 can find out things technically that are                                 translated between                                 in English and understand them you know                                 those idioms that we all unfortunately                                 use that aren't understood                                 internationally all the time which kind                                 of leads to some of the other problems                                 that I've learned over the years that                                 you know for example in in the u.s. if                                 we use the term table and item I it took                                 me many years to find out that that is                                                                                                         pond mean when they say table an item so                                 in the US when we table an item                                 it basically means we've put it away                                 we're not going to deal with it this                                 meeting it's going to be tabled until                                 later down the line in Europe and                                 especially in England when they say they                                 table an item it means they're going to                                 put it on the table and they're going to                                 vote at it today that it's important                                 it's on the table                                 so just an interesting thing people                                 don't know what that means so you have                                 to be careful on these type of you know                                 regional

we have enough                                 votes to make something pass same kind                                 of idea an endowment at the ASF we're                                 working on an endowment project and it                                 was quite surprising to find out that                                 two of our nine board members you know                                 some of the smartest people in the world                                 had no idea what the term endowment                                 meant and if people here don't know what                                 it means it's basically when you you get                                 donated a specific amount of money and                                 you don't spend that money you only                                 spend the interest earned on that money                                 so that you can have a long term                                 investment for the the sustainment of                                 the organization and then one of my                                 favorite ones really that I think fit                                 for this conference was you know the                                 famous quote with John F Kennedy which                                 is somewhat done but you basically said                                 something to the extent of I am a jelly                                 doughnut you know with dick Ben Berliner                                 because in Berlin and I'm not even gonna
