Description: 
	Trevor Grant talking about "The Perils of Building Better Mousetraps (or Marketing for Open Source Developers)"

Most developers (any developers) have little to no exposure to the world of marketing.  In Open Source project, developers are doing this for fun and on their own time- which usually means they want to write code and make cool new features. But why are you building this cool amazing software, if no one is going to use it? Marketing can be tedious but it really is essential for both increasing user adoption of a project and recruiting new devs to help work on the project.

The Big Data Apache projects of the late 2000s-early 2010s (e.g. Hadoop and Spark) were wildly popular- however they both solved a very painful business problem AND had professional marketing departments behind them. For most smaller projects, this falls back on developers and other community members.  

In this talk we’ll discuss, the “path users/developers take to find your project”, the open source “purchase funnel” (getting someone to become aware, interested in, trying out, and becoming a contributor to your project), tactical considerations such as SEO, Google Adwords, Twitter campaigns, overall cohesive messaging, and more- all through a case study around Apache Mahout which after becoming extremely popular in the early 2010’s, fell out of popularity (a victim of professional marketing from other projects, among other things), refactored, and now has a unique problem of being a well known name in Big Data, but known for something it no longer does (run on Hadoop).

	                              how y'all doing today my name is trevor                               grants and i will be giving this talk                               this is the talk about the better                               mousetraps and marketing on open source                               projects a little about me I'm a PMC of                               Apache mahute and Apache streams an open                               source evangelist at IBM and I am I've                               got my masters of applied mathematics an                               MBA in a website and a Twitter handle                                and I'm also available at Apache org so                                please reach out a little bit about                                mahute so the way the flow of this                                project is we're going to this is maybe                                a case study of going through this                                marketing and mahute said some really                                interesting and different problems then                                a lot of projects have in the case of                                mahute we've got a really high brand                                recognition                                unfortunately that brand recognition is                                for something that we don't do anymore                                so this is we're recognized for the                                wrong things when people do a search for                                Mahmood they're finding blog posts for                                what we used to do                                originally it was a leucine sub-project                                it became a top-level project in                                        was machine learning for MapReduce and                                Hadoop that was the the famous mahute                                that everyone hears about then there was                                the rise of spark ml and the Lib and the                                old graphs on how much faster machine                                learning runs on spark were implicitly                                running against mahute now my dancing no                                there we go                                there's three kind of open source                                projects in general you're either on                                your open source project either no one                                knows about your project and you wish                                they would find out about it                                everyone misunderstands your project                                they've heard of it but they don't                                really understand what it does or                                everyone knows your project and they                                want to be a committer on it and a                                contributor and if that's the real big                                problem you're having Holdings given a                                talk right next door on exactly that but                                the first two people here we are now I                                said I used to I know I didn't mention                                all my about me my first job I was a                                data scientist at a media strategy firm                                it's called this company called mine                                share part of WP PE which is a really                                big media company now I'm assuming that                                everyone in this audience is a developer                                not an adman just because that's what                                conference we're at but marketing's for                                everyone                                you started working on your open source                                project because you wanted to write some                                code about something you really cared                                about and the problem is you want people                                to use your project and the problem                                there is people need to find out about                                it and the marketing teams aren't doing                                open source they have their own                                philanthropic pursuits that they follow                                so you're the marketing team you signed                                up to write some free code but someone's                                got to market it and it's gonna have to                                be you or people on your project the                                exception is there's two either you                                don't mark it and nobody uses your                                project and you're ok with that because                                you really really just wanted to write                                the software or the second exception is                                you start a company with your project                                you get some VC money you pay a                                marketing team and that works too and I                                have no problem with people taking                                advantage of the VC Vampires if you want                                to do that go nuts but assuming you're                                gonna be doing your own marketing I'm                                gonna present something called a                                marketing funnel this is a pretty                                standard business one-on-one idea that                                applies to any project or product                                open-source software included you've an                                awareness a bunch of where people are                                aware of your product first then they                                become they consider using your project                                then they maybe use it once or they try                                it out then they become a regular user                                and then they become like a product                                champion someone who really cares about                                your product as an example of this would                                you please raise your hand if you've                                heard of Apache mahute before today ok                                 everyone raise your hand then cuz you                                 heard of Apache Mahmood now so everybody                                 start to keep your hands up then                                 if you have ever considered using Apache                                 mahute keep your hands up if you've ever                                 downloaded and tried my boot once ok                                 we're getting a little weaker and keep                                 them up if you were a regular user you                                 built anything around the hoot so at                                 this point the funnel has now gone to                                   unfortunately but that's the idea and                                 any open source project is really going                                 to follow that and then past user a                                 person who regularly uses the product                                 you have a contributor and so we want to                                 get more contributors usually or maybe                                 we're just trying to get users but we                                 need to set those goals and so this                                 story is gonna be about the challenges                                 Macoutes had and going through this                                 funnel and rebuilding things because we                                 do not do MapReduce anymore and when I                                 introduce myself and I say you know I'll                                 be in an interview or people asked oh                                 you have an experience doing you know                                 machine learning with big data and I'm                                 like actually I'm a PMC on Apache mahute                                 and they're like oh best case they will                                 say I've never heard of Apache moving                                 I'm like great we start from Ground Zero                                 and I can start telling you about it but                                 normally what I get is do people still                                 do learning on MapReduce I don't use                                 MapReduce anymore                                 did you know machine learning is a lot                                 faster on smart than on MapReduce and                                 isn't mahute dead which is always my                                 favorite we don't do yeah we we run on                                 spark now we run on spark we run off                                 lots of engines so we always end up                                 havin to have that conversation of an                                 it's so instead of just telling them                                 what the project does we have to                                 dismantle all these old ideas it is what                                 it is                                 so we're trying to evangelize and                                 rebrand and this is about opening up                                 that top level that awareness we want to                                 people now we need to make people aware                                 not only of mahute which a lot of people                                 already are but we need to make them                                 aware that we've changed what we're                                 doing we did a really really big push on                                 this fall of                                                            of petered out and we'll talk about that                                 slightly along the way but um yeah a lot                                 of conference talks a lot of evangelism                                 in developer circles                                 blog posts and conference talks or how                                 people hear about things I feel like I'm                                 literally preaching to the choir here                                 because you're all at a conference                                 learning about new things and Berlin                                 buzzwords was right before we did we                                 petered out as we went to the fall in                                 spring of                                                             then blog posts again pushing those out                                 via Twitter but just trying to make                                 people aware that our project is still                                 around it's not dead and it's changed so                                 we were and we started gaining traction                                 this was a really exciting part you know                                 we start off I was hearing a lot more                                 isn't mahute dead in                                                    then I have recently which is nice I                                 mean usually either getting I've never                                 heard of it or they have heard of it and                                 they know what it is and that's great                                 PMC's and people on the project can                                 always write blog posts and we obviously                                 care a lot about it so we'll write                                 getting outs new users to come in and                                 contribute write blog posts feels a lot                                 better because that means someone's                                 using the product everyone wants to feel                                 like your products being used these                                 people are not only using it but they're                                 using it enough that they care to write                                 a blog post so when I I give a very                                 similar talk to this at Apache Con in                                 Miami last year and there was about                                    blog posts that had come out in the last                                                                                                      reproduce I'm like well great I was                                 updating the slides I can only find one                                 from the last year so that's good that's                                 progress we're moving in the right                                 direction                                 also the I'd like to call out the Oh top                                 skills they'd assign tests need to learn                                 in                                                                     it was by this was according to the guy                                 who wrote neo                                                        database soho i don't know if he was                                 talking about the Numa moot I'm going to                                 assume he was it wasn't explicitly                                 stated and so that felt really nice a                                 very non-scientific non data based graph                                 that you can use is the Purple Line is                                 the amount of effort of people working                                 on the project over the last well year                                 and a half two years                                 the effect of all that work is the blue                                 line there's a lag this is also can be                                 demoralizing when you're working and                                 working and working it may be putting                                 like                                                                    project and it just doesn't feel like                                 anything starting to stick then you know                                 maybe you take a little breather and you                                 come back and look at it a few months                                 later and like oh yeah there's blog post                                 people are starting to use it all that                                 work I did is starting to pay off and                                 you get maybe that um revitalization you                                 get excited about it again so that uh                                 the the major points there was a                                 Zeppelin integration I don't know not                                 sure if we have a lot of math or                                 necessarily Apache people it was a cool                                 thing we'll breeze by in a little bit we                                 did a big release in                                      now well we'll talk about that too there                                 was a little there's a little asterisk                                 on that one we came up with a new                                 website but for a couple reasons                                 we died off on our efforts but like said                                 when I was looking at this and starting                                 to do my research to kind of update                                 these slides I realized hey we've had                                 some really good bounce back now another                                 way to do that maybe instead of like                                 looking at it once a year is using                                 analytics this is kind of going back to                                 business nerd stuff but you want to do                                 analytics on your project so you can you                                 know kind of take the pulse of how                                 popular things are are people using it                                 Apache has an internal tool that lets                                 you see the number of downloads off the                                 official mirror this is Google Analytics                                 on the left that gives you lots of                                 interesting analytics about your website                                 Twitter analytics so all these tools                                 that you should be using to pump up your                                 project in the first place usually have                                 some sort of free analytics package to                                 them and the key is just use it just use                                 it and look at it every once a week or                                 once a month or anytime you're feeling                                 bad like no one uses your project and                                 you'll be like no we have about                                     users a day at well on weekdays we go                                 drop down to maybe                                                     that you know we can see how are people                                 getting to our site organic search from                                 social media channels it's a fun way to                                 kill some time when you feel like doing                                 some project stuff but you don't                                 necessarily want to code arguably we                                 could write all this ourselves because                                 we're a machine learning project but                                 Google versions so nice and easy and                                 pretty charts so it is what it is                                 so the evangelism evangelism was our                                 solution to increasing the awareness we                                 want more people to know about mahute                                 because as we were talking about earlier                                 no one's gonna download the project if                                 they've never heard of it                                 that's or no one's gonna consider using                                 it if they never heard of it you need to                                 the first step in broadening out this                                 marketing funnel is making people aware                                 of your project now the next step was so                                 people have heard of mahute this was                                 something that was killing us all                                 through the big evangelism push of the                                                                                                        people excited about our project and                                 they were going and seeing our old                                 website built in                                      right before we shifted away from Map                                 Reduce you can see at the top bar that                                 two of the three like drop-down menus                                 are about Map Reduce so now that people                                 just heard this big talk about mahute                                 isn't about MapReduce anymore and they                                 google it on their phones and like it                                 looks like it's still about Map Reduce                                 though just just but just looking at the                                 website it is what it is                                 there's also Wikipedia pages didn't like                                 need to be updated so getting a new                                 website was a really big push for us we                                 were originally we were running on the                                 old Apache content management system a                                 problem with that is only committers can                                 update the website we had people doing                                 drive-bys all the time like hey I                                 noticed a link is out of date here's the                                 correct link                                 I noticed a typo on this page website                                 fixes because you know people you know                                 maybe their interest in the project and                                 maybe they just want to do a little help                                 but website fixes are great newbie                                 issues if you know a lot of people don't                                 have experience doing pull requests to                                 an open source project and they don't                                 feel like they're smart enough experts                                 to maybe critique your stochastic                                 singular value decomposition algorithm                                 but that's definitely a typo and they're                                 very sure that it's a typo and they can                                 make a little PR in a book in a pull                                 request and it's a great way to bring                                 people in we've got I think three PRS                                 sitting out right now that are                                 just that and that's yeah it's a great                                 way to get people interacting with the                                 community make them feel like they're                                 part so that was one of the main reasons                                 we decided to it the other was when                                 people contribute new algorithms we                                 wanted documentation to be a requirement                                 of the contribution you can't just drive                                 by and drop off some cool new math                                 algorithm with no explanation of what it                                 does how it does why it does it and when                                 the website is in with the code the same                                 whole request must have a updated a                                 documentation page or if you added a                                 feature to an algorithm it updates the                                 documentation along with it um so the                                 new image website's easy to make mmm but                                 very tough to design especially for a                                 bunch of math and distributed                                 engineering nerds we had seen a couple                                 other sites that were using jekyll                                 bootstrap we decided we wanted to use                                 jekyll bootstrap too but there was a                                 couple like really bad implementations                                 we finally had uh we got ahold of a guy                                 named david miller                                 start bootstrap comm he does Jekyll                                 websites for a living we're like we need                                 help we can maintain this thing you                                 don't have to do any work we just need                                 like a basic design pattern he makes                                 themes and skins and things and so he                                 did he helped us out and made this                                 really really beautiful theme if you go                                 online the the lines at the bottom they                                 wave so that's always I don't know what                                 see I thought it was fun                                 it's got like a news section it's got                                 tweets it's it's a very very nice site                                 now one that doesn't say MapReduce all                                 over it so we have a little bit more                                 credence when we say Moe hoots not about                                 MapReduce yeah so the other thing you                                 will notice that there's this new logo                                 down in the right corner hand corner of                                 all these slides we add a bike shed                                 argument about redesigning an old logo                                 we knew that we everyone agreed everyone                                 in the community agreed we needed a new                                 logo the old mahute is someone who                                 drives an elephant it's a Sanskrit word                                 and since the project was machine                                 learning on MapReduce and MapReduce has                                 the Hadoop elephant it made sense to                                 have like the mahute driving the                                 elephant but this was very                                 counterintuitive to our story about                                 we're not about MapReduce anymore so we                                 had a big argument and everyone had                                 their two cents on what they thought the                                 logo should be and the designer so this                                 is another little trick on how you can                                 sometimes just flank it and so if                                 everybody agrees it needs to change the                                 designers like look man I need something                                 that the yellow and blue don't go with                                 the color scheme I need some new logo I                                 don't care what I just need something to                                 make this work with the website we're                                 like we had a big fight about it it took                                 like three months and nobody decided                                 anything we like submitted requests we                                 had a                                                               couldn't we are unable to make a                                 decision on a new campaign all we know                                 is we need a new one just make something                                 up and he's like okay so he made that up                                 that was a placeholder out logo I so if                                 you've been up for the Apache lounge                                 you'll see that all the logos are on                                 banner now that's an older banner and it                                 still has the old mahute logo but I was                                 at go to Chicago a couple of months ago                                 and there's a new band it was a brand                                 new banner that I'd been shipped to set                                 up at the thing and somehow and I'm not                                 really sure how but the new logo got                                 picked up and was put on the banner so                                 apparently that's our new logo and                                 that's how these things work sometimes                                 but yeah thank you David Miller for the                                 logo and the website okay so now people                                 have heard of our project and they've                                 googled it great we got onto the website                                 now we want to have a useful product I'm                                 not going to make this a whole talk                                 about my boot but I will say we've got                                 some killer new features that we've                                 released recently GPU integration if you                                 follow anything about machine learning                                 AI everyone wants GPU integration so we                                 have that an algorithm framework Zepplin                                 will go through these these increase the                                 fact you have good features increases                                 the consideration you have the features                                 people want in a piece of software now                                 they've they're aware of the software                                 they've checked it out the features that                                 they want exists in the software                                 great now getting people to download the                                 software                                 zeppelins kind of like jupiter notebooks                                 um and we came up with an integration                                 and there was an issue with the                                 integration just a little tiny one                                 there was a version mismatch between the                                 spark version that Zeppelin ships and                                 what mahute had precompiled now we did                                 that release of                                                     we're like alright cool                                 but we need to bump that up to a newer                                 version of spark a new version of Scala                                 we'll just do that real quick two weeks                                 well turnaround we did a release we're                                 gonna do another release two weeks later                                 with just a quick version bump that's                                 what we thought was gonna happen um in                                 reality there were some issues one of                                 our dependencies was version locks um so                                 that was fun                                 and that caused build issues an SBT                                 which is the Scala build tool if you're                                 familiar with that rich eventually led                                 to a lot of fighting and name-calling on                                 slack and the mailing lists being in an                                 open source project is like being in a                                 family you fight whenever you have time                                 so in oh and George des met is giving a                                 talk on this next door so if you wanna                                 hear more about settling those projects                                 or problems I'll be in there but we                                 everyone blamed everyone else it was a                                 it was a thing finally about two weeks                                 ago who's dieded we didn't II do some                                 pom cleaning um there was a lot of old                                 MapReduce stuff it was an entire project                                 that totally pivoted its direction when                                 it did so it was done quick the                                 MapReduce stuffs was still kind of                                 supported but not really I've been a PMC                                 I think for a year and a half in a                                 committer for a little over two years                                 maybe right around two years um there                                 were like half the project was old dark                                 magic that no one currently on the                                 project no one goes in there that's                                 that's that's all magic and we don't we                                 don't know what it does we don't want to                                 break it so we don't touch it I'm like                                 okay well started going through and                                 trying to clean these things um the                                 trick was Java programmers anyone anyone                                 no no Java                                 really okay well Java has something                                 called palms and we deleted all the                                 palms and like they were these massive                                 like you know                                                        just dependencies and this is and that's                                 and build tools and plugins and whatever                                 the lead-up name them got back up and                                 start rebuilding a pompous file from                                 scratch started merging modules back                                 together and cleaning out like all this                                 old junk                                 because sometimes code is like in                                 appendix and it had a really useful                                 function at one point but it's been so                                 long ago nobody remembers what it is and                                 so we did a lot of appendectomies there                                 were three logging frameworks and for                                 unit testing frameworks in the project                                 so now I didn't get rid of them all but                                 we have very clear JIRA issues like get                                 cut this down to one we only need one                                 testing framework we don't need to like                                 in the same module they'll have like                                 three of them because someone wrote one                                 function and then someone wrote another                                 function didn't understand the other                                 testing framework like I'll just use                                 this one I know                                 great so getting all that wrapped around                                 okay we finally got it the point being                                 is before they can download you need at                                 the features you need to have a project                                 that people can understand this is                                 another feature but it's a more                                 important one if we think of all the                                 people in the world who understand                                 distributed engines like spark and flink                                 and just distributed engines in general                                 this is a that's a small set now if you                                 think of the people in the world who                                 understand advanced mathematics and like                                 stochastic or you know singular value                                 decomposition x' and k-means and like                                 how to actually write these out                                 algorithms this is also a small set and                                 if we get the overlap between the two                                 groups this is a very small set so Scala                                 has this thing where you can write a                                 domain-specific language and one of the                                 early things would have done was make a                                 mathematically expressive                                 domain-specific language and a way to                                 think of that is like it's like are you                                 can write these lines that look like                                 math they look it looks more mathy than                                 like your regular Java you know a dot                                 transpose and then the name of the next                                 whatever you're trying to do this looks                                 like our which mathematicians use quite                                 a lot it also looks like MATLAB kind of                                 so this was good though because we want                                 more people to contribute algorithms we                                 now have opened that up to all there are                                 a lot more people who are qualified                                 because they don't need to be Scala                                 experts or Java experts you just need it                                 more or less know your way around our                                 and we can kind of help you out                                 also possibly putting tensorflow on the                                 back end yeah because everyone loves                                 sensor fall actually the sensor fall is                                 a great example of this tensor flow if                                 you've used it                                 I hate Google's Python Python supposed                                 to be very expressive language you can                                 just read they somehow make it like very                                 ugly and not type safe Java it they                                 destroy everything that was nice about                                 Python and then they that's and that's                                 what they ship so at least you can write                                 mathematically expressive tensorflow if                                 we get these bindings set up okay now                                 we've worked our way down the funnel a                                 little bit people can download things oh                                 and we've we've increased our user base                                 in our contributor base a little bit now                                 the engine neutrality because the whole                                 idea is we can have different back-end                                 engines this also jokes this is                                 important because there are some big                                 companies that will not declare that                                 they're using mahute but they are and                                 this engine your travel T is a big deal                                 for them because if you are proprietary                                 company X and you want everyone to use                                 you know your special high-speed                                 database which is probably just a                                 wrapper around another open source                                 database but you've made an appliance                                 out of it so it's whatever but you don't                                 want to write an entirely new machine                                 learning framework from the ground up                                 you can just take my boot and shimmy                                 shimmy and write some bindings and tada                                 you're done but that also increases our                                 users the algorithm framework we talked                                 about it also makes this easy to for                                 people who are doing a pull review when                                 you're doing your maintaining a machine                                 learning project you not only have to                                 have people who understand them the code                                 and like what Scala is doing but also                                 that like the mathematics that are being                                 laid down are doing the right thing that                                 this person is correctly defined this                                 function in this language when you have                                 a mathematically expressive DSL that                                 also makes it easy to like not only                                 contribute but or if that person just                                 decides they're going to take off they                                 don't care anymore about the project                                 it's whatever people who come by later                                 can still read those algorithms and know                                 what                                 saying we made a template to make it                                 easier for people to drag-and-drop                                 algorithms into our framework                                 encouraging everyone to use dev the dev                                 lists this is an Apache specific thing                                 surprisingly hard sometimes for people                                 to like figure out how to use a mailing                                 list there you just send an email and                                 subscribe and whatever but the guy who                                 was helping us out the website I think                                 it took a while to get him actually on                                 the mailing list but or he was being                                 quiet it could have been either way but                                 you know doing that hand-holding with                                 people who are new committers is another                                 important thing and contributors and so                                 this is the our marketing funnel but now                                 much much much bigger because of all the                                 steps we've been taking now how this                                 actually progressed I think we did the                                 math DSL first and then we had that big                                 spike in                                                                necessarily do it first the way you                                 ideally should do it well not even                                 necessarily because if you make a bunch                                 of people aware of your thing but then                                 your products not ready all you're doing                                 is setting up trouble for yourself later                                 on down the road because they think your                                 product doesn't work but the things to                                 think about when you're trying to market                                 your open source project then our                                 awareness consideration casual user user                                 and then like products you know champion                                 or an evangelist or contributor so                                 what's next we're working on our                                 algorithms framework we're working our                                 GPUs there's a big number of things more                                 engine bindings getting over the version                                 lock that is just about done                                 we're also talking about maybe excepting                                 mahute our MapReduce pr's again                                 that was a it's we're talking about it                                 it was a thing that um we stopped when                                 we deprecated the MapReduce we wanted                                 people be like no we're not doing                                 MapReduce anymore but it's been three                                 years people are now starting to write                                 blog post and understand we don't do                                 that and there are still some MapReduce                                 users and there are there's a couple                                 bugs there's a couple PRS they didn't                                 get their PR and done in time for                                 whatever the cutoff date and if people                                 want to do that that's fine we don't                                 necessarily we're not MapReduce experts                                 but if we can find someone who can                                 review it and say yeah this looks pretty                                 legit then that's an idea we're opening                                 back up the conclusion then is some                                 doing yeah we're doing okay on time we                                 did a big transportation and we want                                 people to be aware that we did this big                                 transformation um but I guess for the                                 point of this crowd it's that even if                                 you have everybody knows about your                                 project but they know about it the wrong                                 thing that's fine it doesn't mean like                                 all is lost or you have to scrap the                                 project arguably maybe we should have                                 scrapped it and made a new project but                                 we didn't and I think that's okay now we                                 still have you you can ride that old                                 brand recognition out and you can do                                 something good with it means always help                                 talks you should always use memes in                                 your talks and try to get people to                                 giggle and remember that and remember                                 the marketing funnel if there's if                                 there's any real content here it's                                 basically this one slide and that all of                                 your you maybe don't have to focus on it                                 exclusively but if you want people to                                 use your project you need then to think                                 of you know what are you doing and how                                 are you where the where the roadblocks                                 where is that funnel this isn't really                                 drawn to scale you would ideally want                                 people to become aware consider it use                                 it you know and like you want that angle                                 to be pretty pretty sharp yeah sharp so                                 thinking about how many people just                                 thinking about this sort of thing use it                                 as a framework when you're considering                                 what's going on with your project where                                 your bottlenecks how are you going to                                 reach more users um yep so with that I                                 am going to open up the floor for                                 questions                                 you like the lone voice for marketing in                                 your project or is your community                                 generally sort of quite aware of this is                                 something we need to be doing I would                                 say so the question are I guess he had                                 the mic so um I would say that everyone                                 was aware that we needed to do more                                 marketing it's a it's a community of                                 volunteers we have various amounts of                                 time and you know every business is                                 cyclical I had a strong background                                 working in media agencies which for data                                 science or math people like it was                                 somewhat different um so I was able to                                 see like yet we need to be talking about                                 this we need to do this                                 there have been there's usually always a                                 couple people who are really really good                                 speakers who like to go out and give the                                 talks and there and there still are                                 ending new Suleman and erm you Suleman                                 is another guy on the project who's                                 really been doing even more this year                                 than I have and we also had this kind of                                 concept of a democracy where you know it                                 was like the logo everyone knew that the                                 logo the old logo was bad it was a bad                                 logo we needed to do something else but                                 no one was able to do anything and                                 that's why again especially in the case                                 of the logo it was great to have just                                 like let's just have an outsider and                                 randomly delegate the power to make                                 something and then if no one complains                                 okay that that works then let's it could                                 because it was and you shouldn't                                 necessarily do that on all your projects                                 and all your problems but sometimes the                                 logo doesn't matter the logo has nothing                                 to do with the effectiveness of the                                 product and we were except that the old                                 logo was bad so I guess yeah the                                 community realizes that there's a                                 problem some people will be better than                                 others at helping out and jumping on                                 board with that                                 like in this one the question is you get                                 a lot of bike shed arguments yeah nope                                 totally um so the initial website                                 refactor the question is do we get a lot                                 of bike shed arguments visually you know                                 if you ask everyone for their opinion                                 and input everyone will give it to you                                 we but again with the do or the do or                                 see especially in our community kind of                                 carries the day go for it and open the                                 PR and see if anybody gripes and                                 normally if they don't then cool we also                                 but sometimes they will and when they do                                 gripe you should take it seriously don't                                 try to bully your things through I did a                                 first pass on the website and it was                                 hideous but it was something and because                                 one someone on the project was on the                                 ComicCon it wasn't like really felt                                 moved over to the Jekyll and liked the                                 internal code and I had like the new                                 website and staging so people could look                                 at it and he accidentally committed                                 something and no one's really sure how                                 but the new version of the site got                                 launched and it was luckily at like                                      in the morning but he's like do and I'm                                 like oh I think I can and I had just in                                 case we wanted to roll back to the old                                 site one day for like retro day I had                                 kept the skin of the old site like okay                                 we can save this don't worry got off                                 traffic there in general no people are                                 really as long as you if you're willing                                 to do the work and if somebody doesn't                                 like it then they should be willing to                                 step up and do the work to um you can't                                 just be a negative Nancy I would say is                                 more of a community standard than an                                 official role but it's a good one so                                 there there are a lot of talks about how                                 to do better marking for developers so                                 there a couple things that are a lot of                                 other people are covering which is how                                 to actually you know write something                                 that's that's useful in approachable and                                 then also how to plan which your you                                 were talking about a bit is how like you                                 organize your project because I'm not                                 gonna do it all but I can do one blog                                 post and maybe you can do something else                                 yep but the thing I thought was was new                                 here was the reminder of your your graph                                 of effort versus effect mm-hmm right                                 because marketing is takes time yep                                 right you get your message out you've                                 done something useful                                 takes time for that to circulate for                                 some realist or echo it which is not                                 like what developers have I mean yes we                                 complain that ci takes three hours to                                 finish this bill but yeah awareness                                 thing is gonna take months to really                                 show okay so be patient                                 is it a key message I think for                                 developers yeah III think that's not                                 represent Ryan you're you're spot-on                                 with that as developers we make a little                                 change in the code we want to see the                                 results now don't have that kind of the                                 faith of the admin to be like well we'll                                 just do brand recognition advertising                                 and and eventually people will come to                                 know the brand yeah I would agree very                                 importantly other questions okay well I                                 assume it's just cuz I did give a really                                 really amazing talking covered all the                                 basis points um thank you all for coming                                 out and feel free to stop by and either
