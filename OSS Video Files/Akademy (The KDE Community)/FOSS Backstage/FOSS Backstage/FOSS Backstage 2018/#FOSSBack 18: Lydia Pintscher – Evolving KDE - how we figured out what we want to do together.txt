Title: #FOSSBack 18: Lydia Pintscher â€“ Evolving KDE - how we figured out what we want to do together
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	KDE was founded more than 20 years ago, making it one of the longest-living free software projects. KDE started out creating a desktop for Linux. Over those years the world around KDE has changed rapidly - new devices, different expectations from our users, more and more things happening in the cloud. The good old desktop alone wasn't going to keep us relevant anymore and you could see it in the community. We became more splintered and demotivated while the need for free software for people's day-to-day work grew and grew.

In this talk I'd like to take you through our long but rewarding efforts of figuring out our place and strategy in a new world and how we did this collaboratively with the whole community.

	                              thank you very much and thank you for                               coming even though their soccer outside                               very brave um I want to talk about                               evolving KDE                               how many of you have actually heard of                               Katy almost everyone                               amazing so KDE started with this email                               new project cool desktop environment                               programmers wanted that was what Matias                                at which sent out in                                                    desktop environment for Linux for                                end-users and it should be a GUI because                                there were a lot of command-line things                                already and he was very expressive about                                what he wanted to do and what he wanted                                to have and who he wanted to build it                                for he wanted to build it for somebody                                who wants to browse the web with Linux                                write some letters and play some nice                                games and that was what drove Katie's                                development for a very long time we had                                KDE                                                                  was around the time when I enter in KDE                                and at that point we feel really stable                                it's awesome we had a lot of users who                                really liked what we were doing so at                                that point we said we have to get all                                the technical depth that we have done                                and all the changes that are done in our                                underlying toolkit and and basically                                make a lot of really fundamental changes                                so we're ready for the future which                                brought us to Katie for now some of you                                might know that was technically                                excellent in terms of how our users                                perceived it unfortunately not so much                                because a lot of the things they have                                learnt you love about KDE went there in                                hey                                                           through the releases that came after                                that so we had an excellent technical                                base and attacked an excellent testament                                why I meant a lot of programs around it                                like critter or natural painting program                                model or a desktop globe                                and many many more um so in some way we                                had reached what matthias a tree set out                                to do in                                                             also moved our version control system                                from as we had took it so before that we                                were all in one big as we are repository                                everyone was committing to everything                                one shared space in yet that was very                                different and Conway's law says that if                                you split up your infrastructure like                                that your community will split up like                                that too and surprise this is exactly                                what happened so we had this problem led                                it didn't feel like one cohesive                                community anymore on top of that the                                world around us was clearly changing                                people were using mobile phones more                                smartwatches                                personal assistants lots of things we're                                moving into the cloud everyone wanted to                                start their own startup and get filthy                                rich and that stops just where the cool                                new thing anymore all of this together                                meant that we no longer had really                                compelling answers when people asked why                                are we actually here why are we doing                                this what keeps us all together as one                                community and why should anyone join                                that isn't to say there weren't reasons                                for that right there totally where there                                were answers for that but they were very                                fuzzy and it got harder and harder for                                us to articulate them that fraud quite                                some issues with us worth it for us a                                lack of guiding principles meant that we                                lacked a base for a lot of the decisions                                and discussions we were having                                leading the community issues a lack of a                                common vision we could strive for after                                with more or less of the first one we                                had and that of course means we had a                                lot of hard time recruiting new people                                because if we can't tell someone why                                they should join that's not a good sign                                and our public perception still was                                suffering from kt                                                     lot of people in the communities felt                                that something had to be done and that's                                why we started evolving KT in                                          the goal to bring clarity to the                                question where are we where do we want                                to go and how do we get from here to                                there it started in April                                     with announcement hey we need to talk                                 about these questions and we need to                                 find answers to those questions and we                                 did a survey and after a while we                                 published a survey results in some                                 document recommendations based on that                                 survey and I presented that I didn't                                 Ricci node in our annual conference and                                 we discussed about those parts or the                                 result of that survey basically said we                                 have a great community there were quotes                                 in the in the survey answers like                                 there's a sense of working for the                                 greater good that drives the community                                 it is welcoming and friendly and able to                                 integrate people from very different                                 backgrounds and cultures for me it                                 represents the ideal of what a free                                 software community should be so people                                 really saw something very valuable in                                 our community people are very proud of                                 our technology and people cared a lot                                 about the impact they could have while                                 contributing to Katie                                 um they care about giving freedom to our                                 users because they thought unlike my                                 friend Ashish honesty was his t-shirt                                 that says I wasn't using my civil rights                                 anyway they thought no I want to use my                                 civil rights I want to have freedom and                                 need the technology to be able to                                 exercise that and a lot of people of                                 course wanted to scratch their own itch                                 fix something that bothered them solve a                                 problem for themselves and KDE                                 has always been a community that                                 welcomes new people and learning trying                                 things out mentoring and everything                                 around them so those were things that                                 people valued oh yes and for example                                 someone said the right variety of people                                 involved in the past years it did teach                                 me to see the world in different ways                                 and I think that really puts it in a                                 nice way what kiddie means to her to                                 someone and we also ask people like what                                 what's keeping you from contributing                                 more to Kelly what's keeping you from                                 enjoying it more and so on and as I                                 think in every free software project the                                 biggest thing was time and energy it was                                 hard for people to find the time to                                 contribute as much as they would like to                                 another thing was skills that they                                 didn't have or think they didn't have a                                 lack of tutorials to get those skills                                 and unclear entry points for them and                                 the biggest thing a lack of vision                                 strategy and focus for the community                                 that we could orient ourselves towards                                 someone for example say why we're not                                 always moving in the same direction we                                 always want to move forward on the one                                 hand that's great but also not                                 and it's kind of said that we weren't                                 able to channel that energy in a                                 direction that benefits everyone who is                                 using our software so what we did was                                 tackle exactly that problem first write                                 down and before the discuss of course                                 what our vision actually is and we                                 started that discussion in August                                      and that went on until April                                           and went on until April                                              outcome of that is the world in which                                 everyone has control over their digital                                 life and enjoys freedom and privacy this                                 is what we want to strive for this is                                 what we want to provide to our users now                                 it took us some time to get to this but                                 this was still relatively easy to get                                 agreement on because it was high level                                 enough for people to see themselves in                                 this and and see this as what we've been                                 doing for a long time but at the same                                 time people were like okay that's great                                 and helpful but we need something more                                 concrete now how do we turn this into                                 something that's actually actionable so                                 we started working on our mission and                                 started brainstorming around dad and                                 that was the most difficult part of the                                 process because this was the level where                                 people really cared and where it was                                 concrete enough for people to say no I                                 don't think that's what we're doing she                                 we should talk about that and and people                                 were understandably very attached to                                 what they were thinking                                 um and one of the things that we saw                                 happening was that we that people are                                 talking a lot about from their own                                 experience and from their own                                 thinking around us without us being able                                 to say this is what a larger community                                 and our users think so we did another                                 survey with questions more geared                                 towards what we wanted for the mission                                 and used that as a basis for continued                                 drafting of the mission and under the                                 buff at academy our annual conference to                                 kind of wordsmith that to a state where                                 we were kind of happy with it but not                                 really and everyone had a little thing                                 in it that didn't feel right and at that                                 point and that's also I think the point                                 where that I regret most in the process                                 we let it sit for way too long without                                 pushing it forward because it was such a                                 hard position to to move forward from                                 everyone kind of didn't thought it                                 didn't feel right quite right but it was                                 also hard to move away from that and in                                 May                                                               meeting an extended board meeting where                                 the board and a few other people met and                                 looked at it again and said like this                                 isn't actually so hard after we looked                                 at it several months later and we split                                 it into a part that is actually mission                                 and a partner strategy and that solved a                                 lot of our issues and then we discussed                                 the remaining points at the next Academy                                 and close the discussion but as you can                                 see it took us over a year for this                                 whole thing and that was way too long                                 right and the outcome of that this is                                 this I'm not going to read all of the                                 stuff um and I'm actually quite happy                                 with it and again it it becomes more                                 concrete and people have more to hold on                                 to but again people ask okay but                                 what do I do today what how how do I put                                 that into action today fair question                                 we started talking about goals and what                                 we did was tell people they can propose                                 goals they have some time to draft them                                 of what people should or what kitty as a                                 whole should rally behind for the next                                 three to four years anyone could come                                 and propose a goal in our fabricator and                                 discuss it with other people                                 refine it have people join and express                                 interest and so on and then we had a                                 vote with everyone who has a contributor                                 account and in November                                             three winning goals that were selected                                 and this is what the fabricator board                                 look like and these are the goals in                                 short firm or short form                                 thought not top-notch usability and                                 productivity for basic software                                 basically fixing all the small annoying                                 things people keep asking for privacy                                 software giving people better tools to                                 improve the privacy of their system and                                 respecting their privacy more and so on                                 and seam line onboarding of new                                 contributors so lowering barriers of                                 entry adding lots of documentation all                                 these kinds of things that help people                                 get into the community and the good site                                 or the really cool thing that I didn't                                 expect that happened is that of those                                 three goals to where proposed by people                                 who hadn't been part of the core                                 community before but who were new people                                 and those are the two really are driving                                 their goal and and getting people                                 involved and that's really cool so what                                 does it get us of course this whole                                 thing didn't fix everything but it gave                                 us                                 directionally gave us more community                                 cohesion and engagement we have great                                 new people joining us and our public                                 perception looks a lot a lot better                                 today than it did a few years ago and we                                 have companies communities other                                 projects interested in partnerships with                                 us because we can talk about what we're                                 doing much better and why we're doing it                                 now not all of that of course came from                                 this process but I believe a lot of that                                 what's really helped with that                                 lessons learned it was a not an easy                                 process I have to say and I learned                                 quite a lot and I one of the things is                                 in order to go through that with a large                                 community you need to have a sense of                                 urgency and pain in that community they                                 need to see that there is a problem and                                 that they want to fix it otherwise this                                 is futile over communicate and over                                 involve there so saying if you're not                                 sick of hearing your own message you                                 haven't talked about it often enough                                 there is something to that be ready to                                 put in the work and follow through this                                 is a lot of work and if you're starting                                 a process like that                                 you can't stop halfway because people                                 will be very upset and uneasy and you're                                 leaving the project in a in a limbo                                 state where it doesn't really know where                                 to go from there                                 don't do that and it really helps to                                 have a trusted group of people you can                                 bounce ideas off and you can get                                 feedback get feedback from and to tell                                 you truthfully what's working and what's                                 not                                 another thing that I learned is that you                                 have to be really clear of what you mean                                 when you say mission wishing strategy                                 and all these words because everyone                                 understands them differently and these                                 subtle differences mean a lot of                                 communication and issues in that                                 communication for no good reason because                                 people misunderstand the level you're                                 talking on and so on and it's really                                 important to listen to people's fear                                 that come up in these processes so for                                 example there was a lot of fear in our                                 discussions around or are we abandoning                                 the desktop now are we abandoning what                                 we've been doing for more than twenty                                 years and it really helps to dig into                                 that and understand where that fear is                                 coming from and how you can address it                                 another thing that was super helpful for                                 us was to get data the truth service we                                 did really help to get away from a lot                                 of I think the community thinks this or                                 I know everyone thinks this No do the                                 survey and have data that you can talk                                 about and reliably have you have a                                 question sorry lime sorry it's what we                                 used post for the surveys and the vote                                 at the end yes and be ready as to adapt                                 as you go this didn't work out as I had                                 planned and initially but that was okay                                 we adapted as we went along and I hope                                 some of you will join us all of you will                                 join us because we have our vision now                                 we have our goals and we welcome new                                 contributors to join us make them real                                 thank you                                 we have some time for more questions                                 maybe one question or two but not really                                 much time yes hi I was wondering about                                 how many people were involved in that                                 process at the various stages so the the                                 initial survey for for evolving KDE I                                 think was taken by two to three hundred                                 people the vote emails went out to I                                 think about                                                            half of them actually voted and I got a                                 lot of emails from people saying oh                                 thank you that you're reaching out to me                                 because they hadn't heard from her in a                                 very long time but they still had an                                 account and so I think we might even                                 have reactivated one or two people for                                 that which was cool the question I had                                 is so you know given that you did this                                 exercise in mapping out what the top                                 priorities were what are some of the                                 areas that KDE is targeting in terms of                                 new features and platforms um so right                                 now we're working on for example plasma                                 Mobile which is interface for mobile                                 phones an adaption of our desktop                                 basically which was one of the things                                 that was made possible with all the work                                 we've done for kt                                                   paying off same for for tablets of                                 course and so on we also have a group of                                 people who are looking into the                                 automotive space for example yeah                                 so those are currently two areas where                                 we're looking at you and of course                                 continuing to provide a good desktop                                 because I think today that's even more                                 important than it ever has been                                 this is a desktop that cares about your                                 privacy about you being able to change                                 it in the way you want it and so on                                 giving you the control or word does that                                 become KDE light then the mobile version                                 or is because you know there is a lot of                                 interest in a light version that you can                                 actually run on different devices yes                                 sonoda is no KDE light what we have done                                 is actually make KDE software lighter                                 and it's now running one really cheap                                 and low key hardware okay thank you                                 again Lydia thank you very much                                 [Applause]
