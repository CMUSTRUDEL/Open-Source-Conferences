Title: #FOSSBack 18: Nicco Kunzmann â€“ Labyrinth - 400 contributions to a game by students in one month
Publication date: 2018-06-20
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	The FOSSASIA labyrinth is a game for kids to change to their liking: new rooms, music, features. The architecture and process allow steady contribution to the game with gradually increasing difficulty.

How can we make open-source projects a place for learning and continuous growth? How can we bring young people into open-source? These are questions I would like to answer. Over the past three years of Google Code-In, I maintained two games with increasing contributions by students. I would like to share the experience I have gained and end with a discussion about how to open up the contributing process for younger people and newcomers and how to keep them engaged.

	                              I'll show a short introductory video                               [Music]                               yes so this video this wasn't done by me                               so I didn't create it but it was one of                               the students who created the video and I                               would like to introduce you to the                               labyrinth game and my focus which I had                               when we developed this game with the                               students is how to create a learning                                experience not so much how do we have a                                long living open source project where                                many people can contribute but how to                                spark a lot of people into the project                                and maybe maybe it stops yeah and this                                what I got from this I would like to                                share with you so uhm yeah what we can                                we can first have a look at the                                labyrinth and what it looks like so then                                you may already see where are the places                                where one can contribute to this game so                                first we reopen the labyrinth and we                                have characters we can choose and after                                we've chosen the character we can we can                                walk around so now I've chosen a little                                elephant and I can walk through the                                labyrinth and sometimes they pop up some                                notes about rooms I enter and yeah                                minecraft and there are some bugs too in                                the game for example we're yeah                                that is when end much more like you can                                earn badges for for doing some things                                for entering different levels or                                different places yeah that is in short a                                labyrinth and the vision for me is that                                we we have this game it is customized by                                by the students a lot of students can                                come in there are low thresholds for                                contributing and they're always welcome                                to do so so we haven't                                environment wages welcoming to the other                                students how can we proceed further we                                can talk about where this happened so of                                course there were a lot of students                                contributing but how do I get access to                                these students so there's this                                competition called google code-in and                                some of you who've been to the talk                                about empathy they heard that that                                there's google code-in and this is a                                competition where students can sign up                                too and they can work on tasks so toss                                like small yeah small things they can do                                like upload a picture to the website                                show that you've learned get create a                                promotional video and from this                                conversation on they can join any                                open-source organization that signed up                                it verse                                                             and yeah and contribute to the projects                                they have set up for google codon                                so what what is it like if if you                                contribute to the game um actually I                                lost my notes I get my notes I'll talk                                about this also like you can if you see                                yeah yeah I would like something for                                kissing uh for anyone please yeah okay                                how does work how did the students get                                the different tasks and what inspired                                them so we we launched a lot of tasks so                                students can come in so these tasks I                                can show some of them they are for                                example they're all listed here on the                                webpage so students are allowed to edit                                their own tasks and we can upload them                                afterwards to the to the google code-in                                side and there's for example the tasks                                how to add a character and this is quite                                an easy task you have to remember when                                you are a student you've never used                                github you may need actually to get an                                email address to get into google codon                                and then you need to don't get and then                                if you're saying okay you need to                                contribute a lot of code before we can                                get your contribution then those                                students mostly will fail so adding a                                character is one way of reducing the                                load for a student so they paint a paint                                a character on the computer maybe you                                would paint better with Inkscape because                                it's an SVG game where you can zoom in                                and everything is clear and then they                                have to edit one style of JavaScript and                                yeah then we can merge and they have                                their character into the game and can                                play with the character and I think                                that's an experience that keeps them                                with the game                                there they're even more tasks that the                                 students can choose for example to add a                                 level so of course we have those small                                 tasks like add a character and there's                                 add a level now we can create many tiles                                 you can create a new whole landscape                                 with different places to go and there                                 are also other types of tasks so these                                 are coding tasks but there are also                                 tasks that that change it that changed                                 the whole experience of contributing for                                 example please enable a new task so for                                 example their student said oh cool we                                 can contribute to the game we have added                                 a character we have added a new place                                 where you can go but I would like to                                 have some music and actually there was                                 somebody claimed this task and created                                 an API for other students to play music                                 so that for them it is as easy to add                                 music as to add a character so they                                 upload a file and then they added a                                 little bit of a JavaScript just say okay                                 I've got this music file and some                                 copyright notice then this file is                                 played so we can actually have coding                                 tasks and we have can we can get the                                 feedback of the students to create even                                 more tasks for other students and they                                 enjoy creating an application                                 programming interface totally new                                 experience than just using it making it                                 usable for other students and there's of                                 also another kind of task which is you                                 know cooperate cooperation and so the                                 the point of this task is that I want to                                 show the students that you are able to                                 do this on your own                                 so when another person creates a pull                                 request to the game for example a                                 character and they don't know how to do                                 that then they ask an another student                                 who's working on this task can come in                                 and say hey let's do this together work                                 together on this and they will not work                                 on the main repository but on the four                                 together so they learn how to set up a                                 project to invite other people and how                                 to actually make pull requests to                                 different repositories not only the                                 master branch of the mass of the main                                 repository and with this we can create a                                 more like a cooperative environment                                 where the students have each other so                                 actually I would like some more input                                 for example for kissing I'm kissing so                                 why is it so easy to contribute to your                                 project apart from the pull requests and                                 how how did you come up with this well                                 actually yeah so much I didn't come so                                 much up so much with the how easy it is                                 that's mostly the students though                                 there's a lot of a lot of documentation                                 if you if you have a look like we are                                 about here like I don't know a small                                 part of the game and the students                                 themselves their task for editing                                 documentation and they added a lot of                                 documentation first the motivation and                                 the vision and then how to how to                                 contribute what makes a great                                 contribution and also tutorials if I                                 want to do this task how can I make it                                 easy and this way yeah                                 they enabled they've learned they                                 reduced the threshold for new students                                 to come in to contribute to the game                                 there's also some learnings so if                                 anybody has a question please always                                 erase the end oh yeah                                 umm what's the purpose of the game so as                                 I saw in the video I think you start on                                 one tire that's visible and start                                 running around and I imagine you are                                 looking for stairs or are you looking to                                 get out of the turret but what's what's                                 the good is there an end goal or is it                                 just exploration yeah so so for each                                 student this the purpose is somehow                                 different so they add their tile to this                                 and they want others to explore the tile                                 and to see that and to have fun on this                                 so for example there's this living room                                 tile over here and there is a chocolate                                 room somewhere                                 and there was a task to create                                 dependencies between tiles so if you                                 enter the chocolate room and you go back                                 to the living room the living room turns                                 into chocolate so it's something where                                 students can it's a discovery game                                 it's nothing where you can like say okay                                 this is the goal we'll go to the next                                 level of course you can go to next                                 levels but being in this one level and                                 discovering it while you program it and                                 you see you can change it and be part of                                 this game that's this I think the                                 purpose the students and for me it's                                 creating a learning experience where                                 yeah but I have fun doing it but it's                                 not like like jumpin ranking live Super                                 Mario where you need to achieve and you                                 get points students also say that like                                 we have the Move statistics for example                                 so you could count how much it takes to                                 reach the next level but that depends on                                 the students so I am just the one who                                 created like these these ugly rooms and                                 everything else was made by the students                                 also the web design yes yeah I might                                 have missed that because I just walked                                 in a few minutes late but can you                                 probably repeat again what about the the                                 ages these students were like the                                 background in general if if you'd                                 already talked about it I'm sorry but                                 yeah just to get a get another idea                                 okay good question so this is part of                                 Google coding which is an online                                 competition and the ages are I think                                 between                                                                what age they are when they contributed                                 I was just happy that they do I think                                 there are more contributors who are so                                 people who stayed longer and contributed                                 more are usually a little older than the                                 younger ones but that's the age range                                 from my and and what's the sort of                                 average background or what's the                                 motivation for doing this is like an                                 involuntary project or was it in side of                                 some school project or do they sort of                                 volunteer are they motivated in in the                                 first place to come already or so the                                 competition could be a motivation but                                 actually the the ones who win the                                 competition are mostly motivated by                                 contributing so when you for example                                 when you fulfill three tasks not only on                                 this game but there are many many more                                 projects that were like sixteen thousand                                 tasks fulfilled and when you fulfill                                 three you get a t-shirt or something                                 like that or five I don't know there                                 that's so thank you very much it looks                                 like a really a nice initiative to                                 really motivate people with no                                 experience or being so young as you                                 mentioned okay so yeah it looks really                                 nice and like in general open-source                                 projects or many of them have this                                 problem that people feel afraid to                                 contribute because of lack of experience                                 so that's great                                 so my question is on the contribution                                 mode I think you mentioned in one of the                                 pages per programming so how does it                                 work in a distributed environment                                 because or maybe I'm assuming that                                 people don't know each other and are                                 co-located this at the case so actually                                 I don't know how the students interpret                                 their programming might be that so I                                 think in some settings it's a school                                 setting where there are classes working                                 on Google coding so there it applies                                 very well and in other cases I think                                 it's for them to find out and I don't                                 know but they could create a live chat                                 for example where somebody types and so                                 of course for even lowering this                                 threshold we have a we have a chat there                                 so people can just log in and ask hey I                                 have no clue could you help me and so                                 that we also get the students from                                 before creating this pull request                                 sometimes the pervious he gives to the                                 wrong place or they don't know how to                                 click so there's a chance                                 - yeah get them there and for pair                                 programming they somehow they they ended                                 chat they wrote like let's team up let's                                 do something but I actually don't know                                 how they did it                                 okay so no specific tools apart from the                                 friendly chat okay thank you                                 so other any statistics on how what you                                 did may be contributed to students                                 contributing and having an easier time                                 yeah integrating themselves oh yeah                                 statistics let's see I think it's here                                 but it's the labyrinth is the third year                                 of Google codon where I participated and                                 here's some statistics so and the the                                 first the first two years we created in                                 another game which is called flappy SVG                                 and when you have a look at it how it                                 changes so we had like six tasks and                                 there we have                                                            had what is interesting to me like                                    percent of those people creating a pull                                 request they the pull request for closed                                 and we went down to                                                   did this by actually changing the                                 process so it was not like changing the                                 architecture or anything of the code it                                 was like how we relate to other to the                                 students but we are accepting but we say                                 okay you you did this code yeah let's                                 merge it in and they are like excited                                 and then you can ask oh could you let                                 make a little change and make an issue                                 for that and they can claim in your task                                 so yeah just being open to the students                                 and asking questions yeah it's the                                 process that reduced the the waste so to                                 say and then of course you can see that                                 we went over to the labyrinth game so                                 and then we changed the architecture so                                 and flipy SVG there's one single file                                 for everything and it's an SVG file                                 which you edit with Inkscape so whenever                                 somebody does a change method i that                                 changes and you have not conflicts no                                 you can                                 like if two people contribute in                                 parallel you most certainly get merge                                 conflicts so by changing the process we                                 get more merges and here the                                 architecture there was the idea which                                 game is can we create where students can                                 create more characters where every                                 single part of the game can be edited in                                 many many many ways again so you can add                                 new floors again and again and again you                                 can create new music again again and                                 again and new vaults new levels so as it                                 reduces what we as mentors have to do                                 and the students can help each other                                 more and there's this documentation                                 about what can be repeated in code to                                 get the people into the project it might                                 not be that great from a from an like                                 from a point of view where you say okay                                 I want to have it closed and                                 maintainable but from a perspective of                                 learning it's great to have all these                                 tasks which can be done again and again                                 so you can onboard developers with on                                 already on board at developers who can                                 help each other and collaborate yeah                                 that's why we I think together with us                                 we also like increased increased the                                 pull request merged per task so and yeah                                 and overall changing the architecture                                 created a for two times better like two                                 times more contributions relating to                                 this other game and I calculated out how                                 many students were added to google                                 code-in so that's inflation removed two                                 times by changing the architecture my                                 site about statistics we can also look                                 at how how many like what's interesting                                 to me is when I when I look at the how                                 many how many contributors we have and                                 how many Forks we have that means oh                                 yeah                                 times over okay how many folks we have                                 we can say people want to contribute but                                 how many who want to contribute actually                                 can contribute and that's about final                                 half here or the other for such a                                 repository it's about also about half                                 and there are other projects which I                                 worked on it's interesting for example
