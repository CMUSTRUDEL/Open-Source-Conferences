Title: #FOSSBack 18: Dajana Günther & Leslie Hawthorn – Cultivating Empathy
Publication date: 2018-06-21
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	When considering how to design products, teams, or even common every day household objects, empathy doesn't end up on the required features list. Yet, without empathy, teams with enormous technical skills can fail in their quest to deliver quality products to their users. Incredible projects fail to create communities because they don't exercise it. Fail at empathy, and your chances of failing at everything skyrockets.

Contrary to what you may have heard, empathy is not something you're innately born with - it's a skill that can be learned, cultivated, refined and taught to others. In this presentation, your lovely co-speakers will discuss the value of empathy, how you can cultivate it in yourself and your organizational culture, and conclude with concrete steps for leveling up in your interactions with your fellow human beings.

	                              so welcome everyone thank you very much                               for coming this morning and before we                               kick off our presentation diana has a                               question for the audience my mic is on                               you know my mic is on thank you good                               hoom of you has worked in a toxic                               environment before surprise almost                               universal yes                               okay so Bob we are we are hoping that                                today we can come away with some lessons                                learned and effective techniques for                                making sure that if you're working in                                one of those toxic environments you can                                help to make it better or find your way                                out quickly yes so we met a few years                                before and of course we had some stories                                to share especially about toxic                                environments and working in toxic                                environments and so we thought we need                                to give a talk about empathy and how to                                how to interact with other people other                                humans better and that's how we came up                                with cultivating empathy and one of the                                things that I have found personally very                                gratifying in the area of empathy in our                                work environments be that at our                                companies or projects or even within our                                own family dynamics is this conversation                                has sort of taken a center stage of late                                as ways that we can make software                                development better and open-source                                better so once upon a time I think we                                felt like you know there are folks over                                here doing coding they're all very                                logical that squishy human stuff is not                                really their purview and you know maybe                                you have the the nice people over here                                who are your community managers and they                                deal with all the squishy human bits but                                if there's anything that our current                                times have taught us it's that we all                                need to be able to effectively                                communicate with one another in order to                                bring about positive change so again                                we're hoping that we can give you some                                concrete actions that you can take to                                improve your life in your community at                                your company and just generally when                                interacting with other people so that                                everyone has a more positive experience                                yeah so let's introduce ourselves                                because we are talking here and maybe                                you don't know us so Lesley has been                                working in open                                NORs communities for over                                             past projects include google Summer of                                Code and she is actually the creator of                                google code-in and she's living the life                                of an expat here in Europe but of course                                Berlin is her favorite city it really is                                I keep trying to get my husband to move                                here and I haven't convinced him yet his                                family is from Stuttgart so he of course                                thinks we should be living in the south                                I may disagree but that's an opportunity                                for me to exercise my empathy my dear                                friend Diana who is the godmother of my                                lovely little daughter has been an                                active participant in the Ruby community                                here in Berlin for a long time                                she's an organizer a past organizer of                                the rails girls Berlin workshops former                                board member of Ruby Evie and she's the                                community manager for the go-to Berlin                                conference have any of you folks in the                                audience had the opportunity to attend                                yeah excellent very nice to see you here                                and I hope that Diana will get to see                                you folks again in the go to Berlin                                community yes all right                                that's right so why empathy matters for                                someone like me who tends to think of                                themselves as very empathetic I find                                myself not asking this question very                                often because to me it is just a                                self-evident truth that empathy is vital                                for all of our interactions but that's                                not necessarily the case for everyone                                first of all just to define empathy                                empathy is the ability to be idiomatic                                phrases to put yourself into someone                                else's shoes to really be able to                                understand another person's point of                                view to the point where you can can                                internalize it and almost viscerally                                feel it so if someone else is feeling                                disappointment you too can have that                                same empathetic reaction in your body                                and in your mind and this differs from                                 sympathy which is when we have concern                                 for other person's problems but it                                 doesn't necessarily impact us directly                                 we want them to do better but it doesn't                                 necessarily take root in our own psyche                                 and therefore promote us to do different                                 actions or interact with them                                 differently so empathy is required for                                 absolutely everything that we do as                                 people and as technologists so                                 everything from what is the user                                 experience like when some                                 makes use of our software what is the                                 developer experience like when someone                                 takes our code and attempts to extend it                                 or build on top of it what is it that                                 actually creates an understanding of the                                 needs of others when we are creating                                 something and if we don't have the                                 understanding of what other people are                                 trying to gain from their interactions                                 with us or with our code we're not going                                 to meet their needs we're not going to                                 be able to pull them into our community                                 as contributors we're not going to be                                 able to effectively interface with them                                 because we aren't meeting them where                                 they are and making sure that what                                 they're provided is useful to them                                 people are happy to engage with other                                 people that they like but as Denise                                 pointed out in her keynote at the end of                                 the day it's about producing quality                                 technology that we can all make use of                                 wallstreet together as human beings and                                 of course it starts all with you so you                                 have to practice some kind of way to get                                 into empathy because empathy is not                                 necessarily a given so you're not born                                 empathetic well it differs but empathy                                 is something that you can definitely                                 learn it is a skill that you can learn                                 that you can practice and it's all about                                 you and knowing yourself how do I think                                 how do I react in certain situation how                                 do I feel about things might it be the                                 dog on the street do I like dogs                                 have I been bitten by a dog when I was a                                 child I'm afraid of dogs something like                                 this and also to express your feelings                                 and most of the time your inner feelings                                 guide your thoughts so if I have been                                 bitten by a dog when I was a child my                                 inner feelings tell me dog dangerous so                                 I will probably take a step back so that                                 is how I will react if you have not been                                 bitten by a dog if you only met nice                                 dogs who never barked at you and                                 were very friendly shaking their their                                 butt right you will probably say Oh                                 doggie hey can I pick you right and                                 there is it shows that there is a                                 difference by your past experience and                                 is also a difference by the audience                                 that surround you so it's probably                                 you're probably acting differently when                                 you're amongst your peers or your family                                 or when you're on the board meeting or                                 even when you're talking to a customer                                 we have several heads that we can put on                                 we have several roles that we work that                                 we that we play kind of but it's still                                 you and people who are empathetic tend                                 to be better negotiators because they                                 try to find a common ground some kind of                                 common ground for everyone could I just                                 add something oh yes please yeah so one                                 of the things that I think is incredibly                                 important when talking to different                                 audiences with different experiences                                 again practicing empathy is really                                 driving home the point that empathy is                                 not just about with whom you are trying                                 to communicate it really is about you                                 there are some people who don't                                 necessarily feel that kindness in                                 communication or what we refer to as                                 soft skills are really important really                                 and fundamentally to them it's all about                                 the code or the work product and the                                 path to get there is not it's not it's                                 significant to them and you know I I can                                 understand that perspective but                                 fundamentally if you want to be able to                                 make that pie bigger if you want to be                                 able to have people come along with you                                 and work beside you and help you to                                 improve the things that you care about                                 you're not going to be able to do this                                 if you are not kind of cerned with their                                 needs as well like you can't just expect                                 people to show up and do it all your way                                 it won't be effective so if you're one                                 of those people who thinks those squishy                                 human things are not necessarily for you                                 we really want to encourage you to think                                 about the use of empathy and your                                 interactions with others because it will                                 be of benefit to you as well and                                 you can get more of what you want so                                 this is not just be nice to everybody                                 it's also be nice to everybody so you're                                 being nice to yourself yes so one thing                                 that I think is very important is to                                 realize that empathy is actually a                                 choice it is a choice that we make every                                 day to be empathetic or not you know as                                 Diana pointed out earlier diana is not                                 something that we are innately empathy                                 is not something we're innately born                                 with right it is a learned skill                                 and there have been several very                                 interesting studies done in the last                                 couple of years about empathy and how it                                 can be cultivated in people and these                                 studies turned up two points that I'd                                 like to make one is that people when                                 given a choice will not do things that                                 they think will cause them to feel                                 empathy when they feel that will give                                 them a greater emotional or cognitive                                 burden so in this particular study they                                 were given a choice of how they wanted                                 to arrive at a particular destination                                 and one way was through a neighborhood                                 where there was great poverty and where                                 the chances that you would observe that                                 great poverty were higher and one                                 direction was through you know a                                 beautiful city center with museums and                                 you know wonderful artistic things and                                 the the beautiful route was much longer                                 about five minutes longer most people                                 chose to take the longer route and when                                 asked about it it wasn't the beautiful                                 buildings or the opportunity to see the                                 museum it was just that they they felt                                 like seeing the poverty and the city                                 would would be harmful to them it would                                 make them sad so they simply avoided it                                 which means again empathy is a choice                                 that we exercise so if we can choose to                                 be empathetic and not just you know feel                                 like well I'm not good at this so I just                                 won't you know worry about it then again                                 we all have the opportunity to improve                                 in this regard and the other key facet                                 of this study was the ability to prime                                 people to feel empathy so the next stage                                 of the research was for the research                                 team to work with this group of                                 individuals and to tell them stories                                 that Illustrated the exercising of                                 empathy everything from a stranger meets                                 someone who this                                 an old tale in so many cultures a                                 stranger meets someone who doesn't have                                 a coat and offers their coats to this                                 stranger and creates a better world by                                 doing this and sharing too you know                                 other tales of people helping one                                 another and being kind to one another                                 and once this the research subjects had                                 heard these stories and then they were                                 given a test about what choices they                                 would make in a given situation they all                                 scored much higher towards empathetic                                 reactions to other people because their                                 brains have been trained with the idea                                 that empathy produces positive results                                 so if we know that this is something                                 that is you know a choice and can be                                 trained I guess what I'm trying to say                                 in a very long-winded way is nobody gets                                 a free pass to be a jerk because they                                 think they can't be nice to other people                                 like it's if it's your choice whether or                                 not you want to be kind welcoming and                                 gracious but don't tell me you can't do                                 it I've heard people tell me they just                                 can't do it and to you I say you are                                 fibbing it's just not it's just not the                                 case and speaking of skill so it is not                                 any innate skill so you can learn it                                 nicely set and you can learn it for                                 example by being reflective what does                                 that mean well you basically their                                 interactions with other humans and I                                 will give you a little example of how I                                 learned to be more empathetic I was not                                 born like this so I had to work on that                                 what I did was I took                                            sometimes just                                                        down at the end of the day I wrote down                                 the interactions that might be a bit                                 difficult for me and I wrote down what                                 did I say                                 and I reflected on what did I feel at                                 that time and what did the other person                                 say and what could I have said that this                                 interaction would not have been so                                 difficult for the both of us or for the                                 people around me so you have to first                                 learn yourself as I said and then try to                                 communicate with others because we are                                 not we are not living in a vacuum we are                                 living with other human beings around us                                 and find some trusted human beings and                                 try to learn in baby steps and talk to                                 them about things like whoa what you                                 what you just said hurt my feelings I                                 can't really say why but let us discuss                                 about this or something like this an                                 empathy is often built through adversity                                 when you go through stress time you                                 Britt you really know who is empathetic                                 around you so just because things are                                 coming easy to you does not mean that                                 they that these things come easy to                                 everyone and I can tell you words matter                                 so if you are for example coaching a                                 junior and you say words like you just                                 have to it's obviously this and that you                                 diminish their knowledge you you're not                                 really empowering them to do it yourself                                 themselves right and to give you another                                 example which I really really like so I                                 have to tell it                                 I saw a talk some years back by a blind                                 person obviously there it is I say it                                 too I'm sorry                                 so I am I am not I'm not blind                                 I tell you I'm not blind I can see you I                                 can see colors this person was blind and                                 he couldn't see colors and it was back                                 in the days when the first iPhone app                                 came out that can tell the colors of                                 things so he was very excited over the                                 day he got this app and he wanted to go                                 home and try this up so he went home at                                 the end of the day it was in the mid mid                                 of winter he was living in Great Britain                                 so it was duck any went home and he                                 tried this app he tried it on his shirt                                 and it said black he tried it on his                                 desk it said black he tried it on                                 several other things and it said black                                 and he was like I can't be and then he                                 was thinking okay um colors colors                                 what's what's going on with colors oh I                                 need light otherwise it will not                                 distinguish the colors right so he went                                 switched on the light and then he tried                                 his app again and                                 blue red orange yellow and he was like                                 oh I learned something today so he was                                 empathetic in the other way                                 so well that what I want to say about                                 this is you have to step out of your                                 comfort zone and try to find out what                                 the other comfort zone is and what that                                 means is not only think about it but as                                 I said talk to people so another way to                                 to cultivate empathy within yourself is                                 to practice a skill called active                                 listening so active listening is a                                 concept that came out of the nonviolent                                 communications framework which was used                                 to in the Middle East peace process of                                 the                                                                      is to ensure that the people engaged in                                 your conversation know not only that you                                 have heard what they've said but that                                 you have internalized it and that what                                 they have said to you matters to you and                                 you can do this very simply we'll do a                                 quick demonstration Diana would you like                                 to have some dinner yeah I feel a bit                                 like sushi                                 okay so sushi so I don't eat fish so do                                 you think they have teriyaki dishes yes                                 I'm pretty sure they have teriyaki                                 dishes okay                                 perfect and also usually the Haab                                 tempura okay great so I'm hearing dinner                                 let's find a sushi place is there one                                 you prefer should we look it up online I                                 think we can look it up online I'm not                                 familiar with this great excellent okay                                 so I'll go ahead and get out my phone                                 and there we go we have just had an                                 active listening conversation I have                                 demonstrated to Diana that I've heard                                 that she wants food I've heard that she                                 wants a particular type of food I've                                 brought my concerns to the table as well                                 saying I'm not someone who eats fish                                 will there be something available for me                                 she said absolutely and then therefore                                 great we have dinner plans now so that's                                 a very simple example but the practice                                 of active listening is about mirroring                                 the communications that you're seeing                                 from the other parties and the dialogue                                 so this can be everything from changing                                 your body language which we do more or                                 less consciously that's called mirror                                 so if I'm talking to Diana and we're                                 both hanging out together we usually end                                 up like this it happens and also by                                 repeating back to the other person in                                 our dialogue what they've said but in                                 our own words we've shown that we've                                 internalized it and that we were                                 actually listening how many people have                                 seen the movie Fight Club okay do you                                 remember that great scene where the the                                 main characters are at a support group                                 and the girl says most people are just                                 waiting for their turn to talk not                                 really listening active listening is                                 about showing that you're not just                                 waiting for your turn to talk that the                                 other person in the dialogue matters to                                 you and you rephrase it                                 some somehow so it's your words and not                                 theirs because if you just repeat their                                 words they would say yeah yeah you                                 understand me but sometimes you do not                                 and no one wants to talk to a robot                                 would you like to get would you like to                                 get dinner yes I would like to get                                 dinner like that's that's not what we're                                 talking about right like you know engage                                 in dialogue bring your whole self but                                 you know again make sure that you're                                 bringing your whole self to listen to                                 what the other person has to say yeah                                 and there's there's another very very                                 important thing where you can actually                                 practice empathy without interacting                                 with other humans this is my favorite                                 way of practicing empathy mostly because                                 I was that little nerd child in the                                 corner with a book all the time not                                 talking to the other human beings                                 because human beings are scary so you                                 can cultivate empathy in yourself simply                                 through the act of reading fiction                                 fiction is an excellent opportunity to                                 understand people's motivations how the                                 characters interact and it's different                                 from viewing a fictive work or you know                                 my favorite shows on Netflix or whatever                                 because my imagination is going to fill                                 out whatever detail the author of the                                 work has not included so I am able to                                 envision a character and perhaps it's                                 clear to me that since this person is                                 very arrogant they always wear purple                                 because they think they're very special                                 like royalty or perhaps you know someone                                 who's very nervous drinks a lot of                                 coffee very quickly right being able to                                 have that mental image that accompanies                                 the story is actually a practice                                 of empathy because you are forced to                                 understand these characters their                                 motivations how they present themselves                                 in the world what exactly is it that                                 makes them tick and by going through                                 that process you can learn about how                                 other human beings do that because                                 unless you're reading specfic which you                                 know has its place you know the great                                 works of literature the world over are                                 about teaching us how people are                                 motivated why they do the things that                                 they do and this is this is useful                                 knowledge for us when we're out in the                                 real world talking to real people and                                 not just turning page after page I have                                 a great example for that can I have a                                 show of hands if you know higher power                                 if you read Harry Potter all right there                                 was a discussion about I don't know one                                 or two years ago about a movie of Harry                                 Potter where Hermione would be played by                                 a colored girl and everyone was so                                 enraged because they said how can that                                 be no no no no and Joan Kjaer Rowling                                 came up and said no no I never mentioned                                 Hermione's skin I mentioned she had                                 curly hair she had big teeth all of the                                 things I never I never really mentioned                                 her skin so it was our imagination that                                 had this Himani character put on the                                 Hermione character of the movies for                                 example so there were people out there                                 who were really really really really                                 scared I think of the prospect of being                                 Hermione Granger with coloured skin so                                 and not again that's the the power of                                 our imagination and being able to place                                 ourself in that story and then think                                 about this as well people are so afraid                                 and so threatened that the picture that                                 they have built in their head of a                                 particular fictitious will be disturbed                                 that it causes public outcry which is                                 fascinating to me yes totally so what I                                 wanted to say with that is actually stay                                 curious you know as a kid we wanted to                                 explore everything we wanted to know                                 what does this button do why do I don't                                 have to why do I have to keep away from                                 the sockets and stuff like this but as a                                 grownup not so much but you should be                                 curious about all the things especially                                 about the human beings around you and                                 because hopefully none of you is a mind                                 reader                                 we are usually not a mind-reader we                                 can't say okay you're doing this because                                 of that that and that is an assumption                                 and I can tell you assumptions are evil                                 really I've been there I've done that I                                 have fallen into the well where I                                 assumed something and I was literally                                 smacked on the head and said no I mean I                                 don't say don't assume anything because                                 we are humans of course we assume things                                 because that is how we built but ask                                 questions talk to the people                                 communication is the key by questions I                                 don't mean close questions where you can                                 only only answer with yes or no do you                                 like blue yes something like this no use                                 open question in German we only have W                                 questions so that's pretty easy but in                                 English we also have H questions so we                                 have what why how for example what do                                 you think about that invite the people                                 to communicate with you so basically                                 those open questions are your friends                                 and I I think it's also a critical thing                                 when we think about the exercise of                                 empathy to realize that there are so                                 many times that we go into a situation                                 with people where we feel that there may                                 be conflict and we have already decided                                 how the other person feels clearly                                 so-and-so doesn't like me or they                                 wouldn't have made that post to the                                 mailing list obviously this person                                 thinks I'm an idiot look at what they                                 said in my last code review you know                                 obviously we're not going to get along                                 because you know this person has                                 different thoughts about politics than I                                 do                                 and again those assumptions are evil we                                 have no idea how another person feels or                                 what their life experience is like if we                                 don't ask them we can make some basic                                 assumptions like I see you are awake                                 excellent probably you're ready to                                 communicate since you're ready to you                                 know since you're awake and you have a                                 coffee in your hand so you know good                                 signals but we cannot just make                                 assumptions about how people feel think                                 or how they'll act because of our own                                 fear or any concerns we have on our part                                 we need to set those fears aside in                                 order to effectively again bring our                                 holes                                 to the dialogue and did you hear the                                 words obviously just right clearly yes I                                 mean oh when you when you did the                                 negative example so that's that's                                 totally fine I too shall fail it will be                                 fine                                 no so uh again if you're going to create                                 an environment of empathy you need to be                                 very explicit about your values and                                 inclusive in those values and what I                                 mean by inclusive in those values is you                                 need to make it very clear why everyone                                 is there together working on a common                                 problem what are the goals that you're                                 all trying to achieve and what are your                                 non goals like what who are the people                                 or the ideas that will not be well                                 served by interacting in this company                                 organization open source project and                                 don't just assume that because you're                                 all friends working on something                                 together that as time goes by and your                                 project matures that that will be enough                                 right this unwritten lore that we tend                                 to rely upon in open source projects and                                 think that everyone will understand why                                 decisions are made this way or how                                 decisions get made or how to influence                                 or persuade within the project it's it's                                 not something that everyone understands                                 and then it can end up being                                 exclusionary if we don't make explicit                                 what our values are and what our                                 cultural history is because people don't                                 necessarily innately understand the in                                 jokes or the the lore of the group right                                 we need to make it very clear what those                                 stories are what the project values are                                 and why we want people to show up and                                 interact with us and I think that this                                 is equally important for open source                                 projects as it is for companies so                                 depending upon what your you know the                                 values of your company are beyond making                                 a profit you know you need to make those                                 explicit one of the companies that I                                 think is a great model and this as                                 thought works anyone in the audience                                 from thought works ok well we wish you                                 the very best wherever you folks are so                                 on thought works website there is                                 actually a page discussing how the                                 company will work towards social justice                                 and the way that they are defining                                 social justice is to help to empower                                 groups of people who don't have as much                                 access to technology with more                                 technology by having their employees                                 have as part of their paid work time the                                 ability to do community oriented events                                 that are educational to everyone in the                                 community whether or not they are                                 somehow commercially affiliated with                                 thought works and they also dedicate                                 developer time and resources to working                                 on projects that are of social benefits                                 such as open source health systems and                                 they not only make this value explicit                                 within their company that they care                                 about making the world a better place on                                 top of wanting to make a profit they put                                 it on their externally facing website so                                 every single customer every single                                 person who pencha Li wants to have a                                 commercial engagement with them                                 understands that these are fundamental                                 values that thought work supports and                                 that they will put their time energy and                                 resources towards it and that are also                                 that is an explicit invitation for you                                 to engage with them if these values                                 mirror your own right they've made it                                 very clear what they're there for                                 they're not just there to write code                                 they're also there to make the world a                                 better place                                 according to these guidelines I didn't                                 have anything else interesting to say                                 okay good                                 as a let's go there okay cool so                                 discourage hippo egg I shall define                                 hippo for those in the audience not                                 familiar with the term the idea of hippo                                 Aang is that the highest paid person's                                 opinion is the only one that matters so                                 it's not this delightful creature that                                 you see before you it's actually not a                                 cool thing so it's not the manager that                                 stands in front of you and says you and                                 tells you what to do and what not to do                                 it is actually if you are the hippo in                                 the room please make sure that every                                 walk every voice is heard so that people                                 have a voice as a hippo I can tell you                                 it is energy draining it is a lot of                                 work it is a lot of mind work that goes                                 into that so when you're in a meeting                                 with                                                                     of all of those                                                       agenda and                                 everyone wants to say something so                                 everyone should have the opportunity to                                 say something we all know those people                                 who are very laid-back and who do not                                 speak their mind very often so if you                                 are the manager the hippo on in this man                                 in this meeting make sure to have an eye                                 contact with everyone and ask them if                                 they want to do this so I have I have                                 this friend I have to I have to tell you                                 this I'm working with him on volunteer                                 projects for quite some time and when we                                 are in the meeting he does this all                                 those nervous nervous things and you                                 know he's warming up to say something                                 and then some somebody else needs to do                                 and needs to take the role and say hey I                                 can see you you have something to say it                                 looks like you have something to say                                 what do you want to say and then finally                                 he comes out with all the things that he                                 wanted to say but he did not speak over                                 over the others because that's that's                                 not how he is and also make pauses for                                 people to think silence is actually good                                 if you are talking all the time over and                                 over again there are people that who                                 cannot follow the the whole                                 communication stay quiet for a moment                                 also in a conf call silence is good                                 people have to think make sure that                                 people have the opportunity to think and                                 the other thing that I think is very                                 important as a takeaway from this                                 principle is that good leaders tend to                                 think that all they need to do is say                                 everyone's opinion is welcome and we                                 want everyone to share their ideas and                                 we have an open-door policy and while                                 they may actually mean those things and                                 those things are true for them most                                 people have been socialized to their                                 past experience that when you hear those                                 words they are empty words and that they                                 are not actually true so I don't I've                                 been in many jobs where I was told there                                 was an open-door policy and typically                                 when I went through the open door I left                                 thinking that the door was gonna hit me                                 in the behind on the way out                                 not a very positive experience so over                                 time I've learned to be much more                                 careful in what I say and how I                                 articulate my ideas in in group settings                                 until I've gotten to know everyone                                 really well and understand that it                                 really is an environment of                                 psychological safety so if you're in a                                 leadership position in a project at a                                 company if you're a highly paid CEO if                                 you are you know the lead maintainer on                                 a project don't just say to everybody                                 you know I want to know what you think                                 because these people probably off we                                 hope like you they don't want to tell                                 you something they think will disappoint                                 you you need to open the dialogue by for                                 example pointing out something that you                                 don't like or making it very clear that                                 you yourself have made mistakes in order                                 for people to feel again an environment                                 of psychological safety so that they can                                 challenge that highest person's opinion                                 highest paid person's opinion or the                                 person with the highest status in the                                 room so don't flip the bows a bit um                                 anybody heard the term bows a bit okay                                 cool there are a few people in the                                 audience so the term bows a bit was                                 brought to us in                                                     named Jim McCarthy and his book the                                 dynamics of software development which                                 is still an excellent book to read even                                 if it has gotten as old as I am actually                                 I'm older let's not tell anyone so the                                 idea of the bows obit is that somebody                                 within your team or organization has                                 done something so silly and egregious                                 that you've flipped the bozo a bit like                                 no matter what you think this person is                                 a clown nothing they say is valuable you                                 just kind of you know you ignore them                                 and all that you say it and do you work                                 around them rather than trying to work                                 with them and the unfortunate thing                                 about us as human beings flipping the                                 bozo a bit is it is it is harmful to us                                 and it is harmful to the person upon                                 whom the bit has been flipped now I'm                                 not saying there are not situations in                                 which a moment makes you realise that                                 perhaps this is not the place for this                                 person to collaborate with you and your                                 team that's fine that's a different                                 conversation to have but if you're in an                                 environment where you have someone                                 working with you and you actively route                                 around them constantly you're wasting                                 your time you're wasting their time                                 you're creating an extremely                                 uncomfortable situation for everyone                                 who's observing this behavior and                                 fundamentally you've created                                 a situation in which this person who's                                 had the bit flipped on them can't                                 succeed people are smart enough to know                                 when someone has lost faith in them and                                 typically if a person has made a mistake                                 and it's a very big mistake shame will                                 cause them to continue making more                                 mistakes because they're afraid because                                 they are quite certain that their next                                 step will be a mistake and typically                                 they're right right and security begins                                 to take over in our mind and cause us to                                 make poor decisions and it's equal and                                 again it's also harmful for the person                                 who's doing the bit flipping because                                 you're cutting yourself off from the                                 opportunity to learn from this person                                 and even if it's just learning how to                                 work with someone you find to be                                 difficult right you have cut yourself                                 off from the opportunity to engage                                 deeply with something that is                                 uncomfortable for you right everyone has                                 a bad day everyone makes mistakes                                 deciding that forever and always this                                 person is not someone with whom you're                                 going to spend your time or your                                 goodwill just is is harmful to everyone                                 around if you need to have a discussion                                 about people parting ways then have that                                 discussion but don't don't sit in                                 collaborative spaces with people feeling                                 that you know you just really wish you                                 weren't there because it's obvious to                                 them it's obvious to other people and it                                 just generally creates a really poor                                 environment and again it lacks empathy                                 and then we come to the next point make                                 it truly okay to fail as I said earlier                                 we are humans we are flawed seriously so                                 we make mistakes and sometimes we make                                 really really really really big mistakes                                 because we we push software into the                                 market that is not ready yet and a lot                                 of customers have a really really bad                                 day for example it does not help to flip                                 the bozo as Lesley said right so try to                                 build a structure of tender tender is a                                 new word that I learned just recently                                 and which I like very very very much                                 because it means be open be have                                 constructive feedback have a                                 communication culture to talk about this                                 and also do retrospectives                                 set of post-mortems yes a lot of                                 customers had a really really really bad                                 day but nobody probably died so let's                                 think about what went wrong we have a                                 process this and this and this happened                                 why do that why did we have this outcome                                 and then let's work from there I have a                                 little exercise that I do with my team                                 every end of every project we do a                                 retrospective of course and then at the                                 end of the Brett respective we do the                                 appreciation game everyone says                                 something positive about someone else                                 and again as the hippo in the room I                                 have to make sure that everyone had the                                 chance to say something positive and                                 that everyone did receive something                                 positive why do I do that to get my team                                 closer together                                 to not only focus on all the negative                                 things that went wrong but also to see                                 what we as accomplished as a team                                 because everyone knows that one negative                                 thing stands out so much against a lot                                 of positive things and it helps my team                                 to bond and it helps everyone to stay                                 motivated to just say yes we can do that                                 the next project will be even more                                 awesome and again I introduced the term                                 earlier in the talk psychological safety                                 but just to put a little bit of context                                 around that so once upon a time I worked                                 at Google and I had the opportunity to                                 observe firsthand their hiring process                                 which could be called rigorous kindly                                 and you know there was there was a lot                                 of kerfuffle within the organization                                 because what they really wanted to do                                 was understand what it was - that made                                 particular engineers at their                                 organization extremely successful                                 because they wanted to make sure they                                 were hiring the right people so they                                 were hoping to find common patterns so                                 that they could you know always just                                 make the right choice of who to hire you                                 know so again data-driven company they                                 sifted through data and you know trying                                 to understand was it a particular unit                                 versity was at a particular programming                                 language that you first learned was at                                 the age at which you got your first                                 computer and you know was it was it the                                 impact of your manager and how your                                 manager treated you like what is it that                                 that created a success for an engineer                                 at Google and people were very surprised                                 to come back and report that what the                                 data bore out was not that it was a                                 particular background it wasn't going to                                 an elite university it wasn't because                                 your manager was very experienced it was                                 that the team that you are on was one in                                 which it was truly ok to fail there was                                 an environment of psychological safety                                 because people knew that if they said                                 something silly or they made a mistake                                 they weren't going to have the bozo bit                                 flipped on them they knew they could                                 make mistakes and because they knew they                                 could make mistakes they were much more                                 willing to share ideas that they had                                 that seemed impossible or outlandish or                                 poorly formed but had the seed of                                 something great within it and that was                                 the number one determining factor for an                                 engineer success was the environment                                 that they were in was one in which it                                 was ok to fail and it wasn't just words                                 oh everyone makes mistakes it was                                 repeatedly demonstrated by the team's                                 leadership and by their peers that                                 mistakes were not costly mistakes were                                 just simply a part of showing up yes and                                 just to summarize our talk so we call                                 this the we'll tell you what we'll tell                                 you that we tell you then we'll tell you                                 what we told you so again empathy is a                                 choice and alert able skill and we can                                 cultivate it through the processes of                                 active listening through reading fiction                                 taking the time to get to know yourself                                 and to deepen your self-awareness and to                                 practice curiosity in your daily life                                 and to avoid assumptions because they                                 are evil and I like to conclude this                                 talk with a quote by Ian McLaren be kind                                 for everyone you meet is fighting a hard                                 battle thank you                                 [Applause]                                 thank you very much Leslie and Diana yes                                 can we have one second                                 just a second so we're going to exercise                                 empathy now on stage which is a hard                                 thing to do what we're going to do it                                 together I am German I am not from the                                 US so I would like to apologize to the                                 people of color I just learned that                                 colored people is a very offensive word                                 I did not know that I am very sorry and                                 I am very proud of you for taking the                                 opportunity to apologize on stage                                 because I know how frightening that is                                 and this is one of the reasons why I                                 love you so much why she's my any                                 questions folks thank you for the great                                 talk so many things I want to ask but                                 I'm gonna stick to one because I'm sure                                 a lot of people in this room are or had                                 know someone who is in my wife for                                 example is in a company that not doing                                 so many of these things and I see how                                 much it frustrates her so for those                                 people who are in companies where they                                 are not the hippo and they see so many                                 problems they want to solve but don't                                 have the power to do so how do you                                 recommend that they try and effect those                                 changes that's an excellent question do                                 you want to take that or shall I upon                                 Tiffa Kate find an ally find as many                                 allies as you can hopefully also one of                                 the allies is a level higher than you                                 and then try to change within it is                                 really hard work it's really hard work                                 to find allies and it's really hard work                                  to change an organization from within if                                  if there are only handful people but it                                  is doable but it takes time because as                                  humans we tend to stick to the post that                                  we have we tend to stick to the                                  processes that we have so we need                                  to be grabbed and shown that it is good                                  to do things I'm absolutely in agreement                                  about the finding of an ally the other                                  thing that I would so there's there's a                                  couple of different ways to think about                                  this one is if you're looking around                                  within the organization and trying to                                  find allies and you don't find those                                  allies it may very well be that this is                                  not a good match for you in your                                  personal value system and it's it's okay                                  to walk away from situations like that                                  you don't have to fix it so it's just I                                  know that there are a lot of people who                                  want to make the world a better place                                  myself included and I have spent many                                  cycles of my life trying to fix things                                  that really just didn't need to be fixed                                  I just needed to not be there watching                                  it happen so that's always okay the                                  other thing to think about is you know                                  most businesses are supportive of their                                  employees setting up informal affinity                                  groups like communities of practice                                  within their organization and you know                                  having an informal group of folks who                                  you know hang out in the office over                                  lunch once a month and talk about like                                  how can we all be better together and                                  you know identifying common problems                                  that's great that's an excellent first                                  step is particularly if it's not you                                  know about being like critical to the                                  business or critical to an individual                                  just like you know we've noticed that                                  employee retention is low we have high                                  turnover maybe we should think about                                  what the root causes are for that and                                  then finally if you're having issues                                  with your management layer you know if                                  you are brave and really you know feel                                  like you want to fix it come with this                                  list of common problems and the business                                  drivers for change so you know if people                                  are really unhappy because there isn't                                  an environment of psychological safety                                  talking about how a more inclusive                                  dialogue in the workplace will help to                                  increase retention because of any number                                  of studies I'd be happy to sender wise                                  and this is going to save us money                                  because we don't have to keep doing                                  retraining that can sometimes spark the                                  positive change that any number of                                  seemingly logical conversations about                                  why can't we just be kind to each other                                  don't necessarily spark in folks there                                  wait no no no there's a beta yeah yeah I                                  know                                  I know but there's the question in the                                  middle ok well then then the baby the                                  momma I think I can't see the back that                                  far maybe it's the daddy it's the mom                                  ok good alright ok thank you very much                                  for your talk it's awesome and we need                                  more of talks like this so my question                                  is actually a little bit similar to the                                  previous but it's from a different angle                                  so I think it's worth asking I think                                  that you kind of pitch in to the choir                                  here and people in this room really care                                  about empathy but I have an impression                                  that it's an assumption I'm making sorry                                  that many developers are kind of like                                  empathy deniers I know because I was on                                  empathy dinner once and I thought that                                  all the squishy bits don't matter and                                  it's just like we just talk logically                                  and it's gonna be great so my question                                  is in your experience how do you talk                                  about empathy to empathy deniers like                                  what works to get people to see that                                  there is something there actually that                                  they should care about alright so this                                  goes back to our early slide about this                                  is about you - right so this is about                                  encouraging folks to think about the                                  problem in terms of enlightened                                  self-interest okay so maybe I am                                  convinced that as a you know as a senior                                  developer that I am you know completely                                  logical and rational and of course you                                  know I don't have to worry about that                                  squishy human stuff that's fine but if                                  you can show to these people that a                                  failure to have consideration for the                                  perspective perspective of others is                                  harming their work that can often be                                  very persuasive                                  so okay so your error messages are non                                  descriptive how many more bug reports                                  are you getting because your error                                  messages are non descriptive and they                                  make total sense to you and of course                                  it's completely logical that you'll say                                  like code error                                                           so that does not compile like which                                  means absolutely nothing to anyone but                                  you right like you could have a smaller                                  issue Q if you just wrote more human                                  readable error messages for example and                                  that's it's not necessarily a great                                  example but again what is the impact to                                  that individual for failing to exercise                                  empathy and once people start going like                                  oh you mean I can make my pie bigger my                                  issue Q smaller and like have a better                                  day then you know people who tend to be                                  kind of you know empathy deniers you                                  know get on the train and you know come                                  along with us and I'm act                                  I would like to reverse and ask you how                                  did you go from being an empathy denier                                  to to being here with all of us today                                  and we are we welcome you to our pot of                                  people who care about empathy                                  okay so I'm just gonna summarize that                                  really quickly for the but the benefit                                  of the the camera not having a the                                  ability to hear you as well so                                  apparently the rationality movement when                                  folks got together and started thinking                                  through things logically they discovered                                  that if they were more focused on the                                  human problems they were actually going                                  to have better success in solving things                                  that they thought were logically based                                  is that a fair summary we'll take it                                  okay okay so let's be being empathic for                                  the next speaker last question short                                  answer yes so actually my question ties                                  in very well with the last question                                  which is just what set you on the path                                  to now think and advocate for empathy                                  Wow oh that question okay I can answer                                  this question um I can tell you that                                  people who come from a difficult                                  background like a really difficult                                  background tend to care more about                                  humans but of but because they come from                                  a difficult background they did not                                  learn to take care of other people they                                  did not learn how to initiate empathy                                  and so my path was I would like to help                                  people I have no idea how because I did                                  not learn it when I was young because of                                  my difficult background so that was my                                  my train that got me into into the role                                  and also um bad role models so as I said                                  toxic environment toxic managers and I                                  have one manager that I always pull up                                  in my mind and say okay I will do                                  exactly the opposite I would like to                                  just say that I learned reductively as                                  well that empathy is a very positive                                  thing to have and I lacked it in my                                  youth I wanted to make sure that I                                  didn't create an environment where I                                  felt when I myself was there felt like I                                  had no power and no agency because it                                  felt very bad to me and I didn't ever                                  want anyone else to be in that position                                  so if there was a way that I could help                                  them not be there and I was gonna do it                                  yes                                  thank you very much thank you                                  [Applause]                                  [Music]                                  [Applause]
