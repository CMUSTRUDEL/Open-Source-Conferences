Title: #FOSSBack 18: Leslie Hawthorn, Chris Lamb â€“ Understanding The Open Source Initiative
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	The Open Source Initiative was founded in 1998 by some of the same people who had started the Open Source movement a little beforehand. It quickly established itself as the nexus for reviewing new licenses and identifying the ones that satisfied the Open Source Definition. This role standardising licenses proved to be the crucial catalyst that converted the pre-existing free software movement from academia to global corporate adoption.

In this talk we will consider:
- Briefly, a timeline of the Open Source movement
- How the license review process works and OSI's role as "Speaker of the House" rather than as "Supreme Dictator".
- The new membership system and why your project should become an Affiliate
- Some of the new working groups and activities
- OSI is newly revitalised and relevant - this talk is your gateway to understanding how and why.

	                              good morning everyone thank you so much                               for coming today my name is Leslie                               Hawthorne and this is my name is Chris                               alone excellent so I have the honor of                               being a former board director of the                               open source and a ship and I have the                               honor of being a member the board yes                               excellent so we are here today to talk a                               little bit about what the open source                                initiative is some of the history of the                                open source software movement as seen                                through the lens of the OSI involvement                                and historical interest and how things                                are evolved to tell you about the OS                                eyes mission and how that is relevant to                                you as folks who are engaged in the open                                source software community and to talk a                                little bit about software licensing and                                some of the legal bits so if you're here                                for community or for law you're in the                                right place so without further ado may                                be some ado maybe the other one hit the                                other one okay OOP it totally worked so                                how many folks in the audience are                                familiar with the open source initiative                                ok so I see several hands that's great                                for those folks who are not familiar                                with the open source initiative which                                I'm just going to now call OSI because                                it is shorter the open source the OSI is                                a nonprofit organization it is a                                nonprofit organization incorporated                                according to the laws of the United                                States and the mission of the OSI is to                                be the steward of the open source                                definition so if a company or an                                organization or just a person says that                                something is open-source it actually                                needs to be open-source as defined by                                the open source definition how many                                folks know of the open source definition                                ok I see a few hands in the room we'll                                get into that a little bit more later                                but the fundamental takeaway is if a                                company comes along and says we we have                                this great new open-source hardware                                product and there is no hardware                                specification there are no schematics                                there is nothing available to actually                                reproduce what they have created the                                open source initiative will call upon                                them kindly and let them know that they                                are misusing the term so the idea here                                is again the consumer can have faith in                                whatever the producer is creating that                                when it is                                opensource it really actually meets the                                definition of open source so the OSI in                                addition to having individual membership                                has a huge affiliate member program                                where we partner with various free and                                open source software projects to help                                them accomplish their mission in a                                variety of ways so as you can see this                                is like the wall of logos of folks who                                have joined OSI as affiliates if your                                open source project or open source                                organization is interested in partnering                                with the OSI so that we can be of mutual                                benefit to our members that's great                                please let Krista right now and I can                                get you in touch with the right folks                                and he is the right folks so maybe it's                                faster to go to Chris so origins Oh                                before open source open source is free                                software we are not going to have the                                tired free versus open debate today in                                fact we would like to propose something                                entirely different which is that these                                are concepts that are what do we want to                                call them not mutually exclusive right                                this is yes exactly                                they are friends they are in my                                perspective there are two different ways                                of looking at the same question so we                                may recognize these two folks on the                                screen mister Stallman bill joy the                                creator of unix so once upon a time all                                software was what we probably today                                think of as open source if you purchased                                a piece of hardware for example a                                printer you would get a copy of the                                source code that would run on that                                printer and it would you know arrive to                                you printed out on you know reams of                                paper because this was you know a long                                time ago and the great thing about that                                was if people were making use of a                                hardware device such as a printer and                                 there was a problem they could then have                                 access to the source code and modify                                 that source code in order to make an                                 improvement so the the canonical amusing                                 tale of this is that there was an error                                 I believe with the Xerox printers and                                 they would jam on every third page so                                 people would be sending print jobs to                                 the printer consistently and then no one                                 would understand why their documents                                 were not printing because apparently                                 printing has always been hard and always                                 will be hard                                 so Richard Stallman had a great hack                                 right he thought okay well I can't fix                                 what's wrong with the printer hardware                                 this is just a failure of the hardware                                 but I can change the software so that                                 every single person who has sent a print                                 job into the print queue gets a                                 notification go check the printer and                                 unjam it because otherwise no one's                                 going to be able to print so it was a a                                 way to route around hardware failure                                 using human to human intervention                                 fantastic so then one day a new printer                                 comes to the office there's no source                                 code included but unfortunately it has                                 the same hardware failure after every                                 third page at jams and mr. Stallman                                 wanted to again modify the software so                                 that he could do this human intervention                                 action and because there was no source                                 code available this is when the free                                 software movement is born right Richard                                 Stallman goes to the the printer vendor                                 I believe it was erupts and says you                                 know where is the source code I'd like                                 to make this fix and this is what he                                 learned about the concept of                                 non-disclosure agreements and the idea                                 that these the source code was being                                 kept as proprietary as a trade secret                                 for the company because they felt it                                 gave them a competitive advantage and he                                 felt that this was a huge violation of                                 the hacker ethic because people should                                 have the freedom to make changes to                                 their devices and to make changes to                                 software code as they see fit so this is                                 the definition of free software from the                                 FSF so basically free software is                                 software that provides users with the                                 four freedoms our folks familiar with                                 the concept of the four freedoms ok I                                 see a few hands going up that's cool                                 because we have them nope right there so                                 the four freedoms are that you have the                                 right to use the software right you can                                 run it on your machine you can run it on                                 whatever machine that you choose to run                                 it you have the right to study the                                 software so you have actual you have                                 access to the actual source code in                                 order to be able to understand how the                                 program is working on your device and to                                 ensure that it is working in the way                                 that you expect it to and that you                                 intend it to work you have the freedom                                 to improve the software so it's not just                                 that you have access                                 - this this code that is an integral                                 part of your daily existence you can                                 change it right you can make it better                                 for your particular use case and finally                                 you have the right to share this                                 software so it's not simply that you can                                 take it and make changes for you that                                 are beneficial to you but then you can                                 if you wish to share those changes back                                 with others so that they may make use of                                 it so these are the four freedoms use                                 study improve and share so as we all                                 know from eating delicious cupcakes out                                 in the foyer yesterday open source is                                 now                                                                 think the OSI sponsor adblock plus for                                 getting us all these awesome cupcakes                                 and helping the USI to celebrate his                                 twentieth anniversary because the                                 cupcakes were delicious and the cake is                                 not a lie so open source has become the                                 proper name for this concept of free                                 software and I realized what I've said                                 is probably quite contentious and we'll                                 get into that in a moment but there was                                 at one point of a severe stigma against                                 this concept of free software because                                 unfortunately the English language is                                 not nearly as exact as German which my                                 German friends in the audience can                                 attest to there's no word in English                                 that means both free as in you have                                 freedom and free as in cost free like we                                 don't have two different words to                                 describe this like we don't have cost in                                 lost and rye yeah so we had just have                                 free and of course as you are attempting                                 to create a business ecosystem and that                                 it depends upon the use of software as                                 part of your business model if you talk                                 to the folks in the room who are                                 concerned with your profit and loss                                 statements and tell them we want to use                                 free software or we want to publish free                                 software their immediate responses how                                 are we going to make money this is a                                 problem and and businesses were were                                 concerned about the idea of using free                                 software or developing free software                                 because they were concerned that this                                 was an impediment to their ability to do                                 business and make a profit and you know                                 if you're engaged in business that's our                                 goal is to make a profit so there was a                                 meeting of several technologists uh I                                 think it was at what be eventually                                 became the ASEAN conference and a woman                                 by the name of Christine Peterson                                 suggested that it would be easier to                                 understand if what was known as free                                 software became known by the term open                                 source' right this was less threatening                                 to people's concept of freely modifiable                                 freely study of all freely exchangeable                                 code because it didn't immediately                                 invoke this this sense of what business                                 competitive or anti business sentiments                                 right nope where we talk about that so                                 open source software lets users and                                 developers advanced software freedom at                                 work as well as in private so the idea                                 here is that because you have these                                 rights under the open source definition                                 according to the four freedoms you can                                 both develop software that fits into                                 these specifications of the four                                 freedoms on your own and you can also do                                 it within the workplace so the first                                 decade of open-source I feel like I'm                                 preaching to the choir a little bit on                                 some of this stuff I bet all of us                                 probably know about the first decade of                                 open-source anybody new here new sort of                                 new to the free source of open source                                 space you are totally lying but that's                                 ok we totally appreciate you so this                                 will perhaps be be more beneficial for                                 folks who watch the video later and we                                 are we are pleased that to have you with                                 us so here is a decade timeline of open                                 source and and it's it's a time of both                                 advocacy and the promoting of the idea                                 of open source and a time of controversy                                 right and it's this first controversy                                 arose simply over the naming right                                 naming is a very powerful thing and for                                 for many people they felt that the move                                 away from the term free software to this                                 term open source gutted the concept that                                 source code was a type of free speech so                                 it is a way in which a developer can                                 express herself with complete freedom                                 and say whatever it is that she wishes                                 to say through the creation of her                                 software and you know that that like                                 caused a huge rift that I think is well                                 I think just think it's sad like I mean                                 now if you look at the open source                                 initiative Board of Directors there's I                                 think there's three board members who                                 are all members of the Debian project so                                 I don't I don't think we need to stress                                 their bona fides and the concept of like                                 free as in freedom right but you know                                 for a long time this caused a great                                 divide and you know I think I'm think                                 we're getting past that yeah I'm hoping                                 so yeah so this is a fantastic timeline                                 which you can all read yourselves                                 because you know how to read and that's                                 fantastic but there's a in addition to                                 this this kind of community-based                                 dissension there's also an era of let's                                 all perform many different lawsuits                                 because we are going to prove if our                                 licensing model depends upon our                                 business model depends upon the                                 licensing costs of proprietary software                                 that this model for open source free                                 software is problematic and we are going                                 to crush it so you have schoo suing unix                                 you have the the Micra sayma statement                                 that linux is a cancer for microsoft                                 there are a whole bunch of people                                 running in and in fluxing to create new                                 software licenses that they feel will                                 fit their business model effectively and                                 trying to modify existing software                                 licenses like the GPL or you know                                 creation of new licenses like the apache                                 software license the MIT x                                              order for effectively developers to be                                 able to articulate what their                                 expectations were for engagement around                                 the software that they had created so                                 this is where you should chat because                                 you are the licensing expert so I'm                                 gonna hand it over to my colleague thank                                 you absolutely yes so what what actually                                 made open-source licensing succeed so as                                 you can remember from the previous slide                                 there's a lot of contention and                                 particularly in the business space which                                 required some sort of crystallization of                                 consensus as we like to say around what                                 the licenses really mean like who                                 or who has sort of not control the                                 stewardship over over these over these                                 concepts also you know what what                                 conversations can people have around                                 open source licenses and licensing in                                 general and you know it's actually                                 things like that and and do we want                                 these conversations to be sort of                                 top-down or do they want from a                                 consensus base from a community point of                                 view so this is perhaps captured by the                                 multilateral unit unilateral divide so                                 do you want a company saying this is                                 what a big company with a lot of power                                 and money saying this is what licenses                                 are and what they what they mean or does                                 it want to be much more community basis                                 and well not so much community but                                 consensus basis so we can have a lot                                 more just basically review or just                                 people that are an agreement because I                                 mean the whole idea is all about sort of                                 shared definitions and shared working                                 assumptions so if you have that's a                                 top-down approach that's not necessarily                                 ideal so yeah my open source licenses                                 are a consensus of the norms for a                                 community and the open source initiative                                 its main job is to be the steward and                                 and crystallize that consensus into one                                 and say you know what great you think                                 this you think that but we think that                                 the and we believe the consensus view is                                 that no particular open-source license                                 means this or the whole concept of open                                 source means something quite particular                                 and that shared definition is basically                                 how we can all sort of rub along                                 together despite or perhaps commercial                                 differences or ideological differences                                 so the the goal of the OS sized board is                                 to approve and one of the many purposes                                 aboard but here it is to approve the any                                 licenses that come on that are suggested                                 to us and whether they fit the open                                 source definition and the open source                                 definition has all the rights history                                 for all                                 right sis three to exercise the four                                 freedoms which Leslie outlined earlier                                 so this is like the brief overview of                                 that consensus in action we would                                 receive a request to review a license                                 under you know do SI board we have this                                 license do you think it's do you think                                 you could approve it and the this goes                                 through some of the technical stages and                                 steps that one would have to do to do                                 that if I may just add something to it                                 so if you are a free software legal nerd                                 please do subscribe to the license                                 review list and just follow along                                 because there is and not only can you                                 watch this process in action but there                                 is so much legal talent that has                                 specialized in free and open-source                                 software on this list both folks who are                                 trained as legal professionals and                                 people who have done a lot of in-depth                                 study on their own and I think it's also                                 important that folks realized that the                                 the review process is not just carried                                 out by the OSI Board this list is                                 composed of people throughout the                                 community from various projects who                                 comment upon ways in which the license                                 matches the open source definition or                                 ways that they feel that it does not and                                 how it could be improved the final step                                 is for the OSI Board to to understand                                 the discussion that has happened as part                                 of the license review process and then                                 to provide final approval as to whether                                 or not the license meets the open source                                 definition and obviously the board                                 exercises their own judgement but                                 typically once the community is                                 satisfied that a license is compliant                                 the board will approve we understand                                 that we you know our collaborative                                 experts in this in this arena and then                                 you know again a new open-source license                                 might be born yes it's very much a                                 consensus based approach if there's no                                 sort of top-down King idea where okay                                 you you you guys all think this but                                 we're just going to say that the this is                                 not our Sai approach or it is improved                                 it's based on the thoughts and feelings                                 of the community but also from these                                 these legal expert experts here                                 an interesting point and resource                                 doesn't have business models but                                 companies do so one other advantage of                                 open source licenses they isolate                                 communities from their members business                                 models so this means in practice that                                 the RSA won't grant particular                                 exceptions in licenses just to fit your                                 particular commercial needs I think                                 Leslie can speak too yeah so it's it's                                 so conceptually right businesses want to                                 be able to operate in whatever                                 environment that they're operating in                                 according to rules right this is why we                                 have legislation regulations etc we need                                 to know what are the rules of engagement                                 when we operate as a business and in in                                 this way open-source licenses allow                                 businesses to when when we talk about                                 like isolating the community like there                                 is a very specific way in which the                                 business can understand how they operate                                 with their software and that folks in                                 the community who may wish to contribute                                 to a project that is either sponsored                                 entirely by one company or that may be                                 worked upon by multiple companies right                                 every single participant understands the                                 rules of engagement because it's                                 codified within the license which tells                                 you exactly how you may use study share                                 and I am very silly and just forgot the                                 fourth freedom hello Misha no I                                 researcher oh you do like sharing though                                 you study read and but thank you improve                                 wow I need to improve excellent so it                                 when we talk about the OSI will not                                 approve exceptions to your license I've                                 seen any number of folks come by saying                                 that they really like oh I don't know                                 the Apache License but they'd like to                                 remove the patent indemnification clause                                 so we can we just have the Apache                                 license without indemnification clause                                 license please because it's better for                                 us when we're running our business and                                 the OSI simply doesn't approve these                                 changes because if you're trying to make                                 your business model workable by taking                                 an existing license and modifying it or                                 creating your own brand-new license that                                 says this thing can be open-source but                                 I'm still allowed to have these                                 Praia Terry bits on the side and called                                 the entire code base open source we're                                 not this is not something that the board                                 is going to do because the license                                 provides rules of engagement according                                 to a pre-existing framework which is the                                 open source definition and licenses have                                 to conform to that even if it's a                                 brand-new license so you for example                                 don't see like the I think the big one                                 was the NASA open-source license which                                 has been very difficult for a long time                                 because NASA being a scientific body                                 within the United States wanted to                                 release their software and very early in                                 the days the license approval process                                 came up with their open open-source                                 license which was totally okay with the                                 United States government to publish as                                 open source so this was a huge big deal                                 that the United States government was                                 happy to give away this software under                                 an open-source license instead of under                                 a public domain copyright law which is                                 very problematic for various reasons but                                 now it's very hard for people to                                 incorporate the software published by                                 NASA into their own works because the                                 NASA open-source license has all these                                 extra specifications that were very                                 specific to that time and place where it                                 was created so again that we've moved                                 away from that as a model and now it's                                 very structured and very like you know                                 we're not going to make something with                                                                                                          because it works well for you we're                                 going to fit into a framework that is                                 simplified streamlined and makes it very                                 easy for people to use and reuse what                                 you've created                                 but listen yeah I need I need my own                                 license well and these have my name on                                 it                                 so vanity licenses are bad I would                                 suggest that instead of this we will                                 find a different way to make you feel                                 like you are well loved and well                                 appreciated                                 thank you oh yes you know we're all                                 about to live here so why did                                 open-source win in this first decade it                                 one because as less interested mentions                                 reusing licences and reusing definitions                                 beats reimplemented me wrote I mean                                 you're just saving time right they're                                 not working out these                                                  an existing license when you basically                                 just want to use that existing license                                 and again like essentially things like                                 that and you know also along those same                                 lines right people were very excited to                                 use open-source once they had a set                                 rules of engagement around it because                                 who wants to recreate the same things                                 over and over                                 and over again and I think if we look at                                 the pace at which technology change is                                 happening from the perspective of                                 software development it's entirely                                 driven by open source right suddenly                                 instead of having to reinvent each                                 component each time within a particular                                 group or organization people can build                                 upon existing building blocks to create                                 the final product that they're really                                 most interested in creating so if you                                 have the lamp stack or you have the mean                                 stack and you can just build it on top                                 of that to create the thing that is your                                 special sauce for your company your app                                 your website it's said whatever it is                                 that you're selling again it's much                                 easier and much faster and it's because                                 of this you know shared body of                                 knowledge and no one has to keep                                 reinventing the wheel absolutely and                                 this this streamlining process of                                 thought means that you can just                                 essentially just get your work done you                                 aren't spending weeks and weeks                                 negotiating what sort of license you can                                 just be like okay using lamp snack it's                                 under these shared assumptions I can                                 work with other people based on that and                                 let's just move on let's just do                                 something actually productive instead of                                 whiteboarding things like that                                 absolutely                                 so the second decade so open-source has                                 grown up a bit and                                 so we have seen open source proliferate                                 right but at this at this stage in its                                 existence like most open-source software                                 instead of being out front and central a                                 lot of it again going back to the lamp                                 stack is infrastructure based right so                                 you know helmet you know we wouldn't see                                 the likes of companies like I don't know                                 who some of the big guys Google Facebook                                 Netflix or today if there wasn't this                                 core infrastructure available as free                                 and open source software because there                                 is no way for any organization to                                 innovate and scale up to a huge number                                 of servers if they're paying you know a                                 per license cost for every single one of                                 them right that just would not have been                                 possible so again we go into this era                                 where the entire ability to do web                                 services is built upon the free and open                                 source software stack and a great deal                                 of the software that is written in order                                 to create what was once upon a time                                 called the web                                                        open source or API is released under an                                 open copyright                                 um one thing that underlines the success                                 of open source and the the term open                                 source perhaps might be that it's the                                 word open is now being used to express                                 other similar related parallel itch                                 concepts for example open hardware open                                 data I mean and this speaks to the power                                 of of this the stewardship and how how                                 names basically and really do matter                                 license enforcement was also it was a                                 thing it is a thing for that so a                                 license it's only is only valid if if                                 you if you comply with its conditions                                 pretty obviously and any and people who                                 violate licenses should be expected to                                 pay some sort of cost social monetary                                 into compliance really right yeah                                 hopefully we would ever reach that                                 because of this sort of consensus view                                 that if particular license means this                                 then why would you why would you go                                 against that why we do enter that                                 community based on those shared                                 assumptions and then not play by the                                 rules so and I think I realize this may                                 be very different for folks in the                                 audience who are from Germany because I                                 was got a great education in some of the                                 ways in which there's patent trolling                                 occurring in Germany yesterday and I                                 assume the same sort of thing comes up                                 around licensed enforcement as well but                                 the idea here is for most of my                                 experience at least is that typically                                 companies come into compliance with an                                 open-source license through through                                 requests through gentle education not                                 necessarily through enforcement via                                 lawsuits right so if you for example are                                 engaged with people like the software                                 freedom Conservancy and they notice for                                 example that there's a GPL violation                                 within a product that you're shipping                                 like they send you a polite letter and                                 say we notice this is a problem and we'd                                 like to make sure that you folks come                                 into compliance and there's like a year                                 or two year negotiation before there's                                 ever any discussion of litigation so                                 more often than not people are making                                 simple mistakes they did not set out to                                 be a bad actor companies don't want to                                 put themselves in a position where                                 they're you know taking on legal risk                                 and liability so I                                 there's a collaborative process to help                                 people to come into compliance with the                                 law of the licensing I mean if anything                                 this speaks to the success I mean we've                                 streamlined this the adoption of free                                 and open-source software to a point                                 where people are sort of accidentally                                 violating and just they're oh well we                                 didn't that wasn't intentional and what                                 it was you've made it too easy for us                                 okay                                 sorry yeah the the in the next decade                                 will perhaps see a bit more I mean a                                 number of licenses require attribution                                 I think the famous example might be the                                 the artistic license which which states                                 variously that not only must you follow                                 the terms but you want to sort of credit                                 where this where these sort of code came                                 from what's the provenance of it what's                                 the who the original author this sort of                                 thing and we believe in the next decade                                 that'll be attribution enforcement and                                 those small angles will be more the                                 focus than then straight up oceans and                                 things like that once I'm going to look                                 at you and say you're the legal guy here                                 well a patent guy painting guy should I                                 say yeah and so yes I mean just to read                                 the first sentence anyway pavements                                 break this safe space on which                                 open-source depends so what this means                                 in practice is that developers sort of                                 now need permission before they can                                 iterate on a piece of software and                                 things like that you should used to just                                 download the lamp stack and iterate over                                 it make you a special sauce on top or as                                 part of or replace little bits of it                                 here and there and the patents and                                 patents sort of violate this sort of                                 soft covenant and they they really just                                 break up break up the workflow of                                 developing free and open source software                                 and notably they must now distrust the                                 motivations of others if you you can't                                 necessarily be sure that you have                                 sort of the rights the the the lowercase                                 F freedom to to work on a piece of                                 software if you're not sure if it might                                 violate some patent and things like that                                 and people get scared and move away and                                 so there's a sort of less innovation in                                 general in particular spaces so you                                 already could take this one please yeah                                 so it was part of the the OSI history so                                 first there was this foot great focus on                                 open-source software and then at a                                 certain point the the OSI Board and the                                 community that had developed around the                                 US I realized that there was a need to                                 provide the same sort of guidance around                                 standards as we did for open source                                 software so there was a definition of                                 what of what open source meant and so                                 what is the way in which we create a                                 standard which we can then call an open                                 standard meaning anyone can actually                                 effectively implement this standard                                 there are no secrets or parts of a                                 standard that can only be implemented by                                 one company because they feel like it is                                 going to be a core part of their                                 business model and you can find this at                                 open source org slash OS R if you are a                                 standards geek so yes in conclusion free                                 software and software freedom remains                                 the essential core of why we're all here                                 today and pretty much most software                                 projects and things that people are                                 interested these days and open-source                                 itself remains a pragmatic approach to                                 software engineering as a idea or a                                 concept a day to day and open-source is                                 the future I mean it's the past and it's                                 a future and obviously today as well so                                 we have reached the conclusion of our                                 presentation and if you folks have any                                 questions we would be happy to answer                                 them and it is also worth noting that                                 there are several OSI board members in                                 attendance at Foss backstage so one                                 apparently we all have to get a selfie                                 and two there are folks around like a                                 Lolita Sharma Denise Cooper and so you                                 can find any of us and feel free to ask                                 us about the OSI we'd love to talk to                                 you about it and why it may be worth you                                 joining as an individual member or                                 having your project joint as an                                 affiliate thank you so so so thank you                                 very much                                 there is a question                                 I'm sorry I should have asked you if you                                 have time for questions yeah we have                                 like                                                        I know there was an issue recently with                                 zsh and a boon to basically the BSD                                 license getting implemented as                                 compatible with the GPL and it had                                 something to do with a lawyer kind of                                 being relatively loose with his                                 interpretation does the OSI have kind of                                 cat sorry excuse me                                 right up on that that's successful to                                 sort of the casual developer to                                 understand the nuances of that case well                                 there and I can't speak to the the that                                 case particular but I believe there is                                 some discussion about that I'm not sure                                 there's a very nicely nuanced summary                                 view that's yeah there's almost                                 certainly a very long thread about our                                 license so that's a complicated issue so                                 I mean it's not you're right just sort                                 of somewhat characterize it as in a                                 liberal interpretation cetera et cetera                                 but yeah it's it's it's a complicated so                                 the OSI doesn't necessarily do like                                 position papers or explications of the                                 law just because it would be beyond the                                 purview of the organization as a as a                                 non-profit and you know this is when we                                 all get to wave and say I am NOT a                                 lawyer                                 except for Richard Fontana who really is                                 a lawyer and for those kinds of                                 resources like once upon a time I would                                 look to grok law which sadly we no                                 longer have available to us but if                                 that's the kind of thing that you're                                 interested in learning more about and                                 having something that's like accessible                                 to the casual person like explicate the                                 heck is going on in this like                                 complicated twisted thing over here I                                 agree that that is an excellent                                 community resource I don't think that                                 the OSI based on its mission and charter                                 would be the the right group of folks to                                 do that but what I would love to see in                                 the spirit of open source if folks want                                 to collaborate on something like that                                 that would be really cool because the                                 one thing that I know about open source                                 legal eagles is we don't have enough of                                 them and they don't have a lot of time                                 to write                                 I don't know maybe we could do like                                 phone-a-friend ask your question and you                                 know podcast it like I mean how bad                                 could that be probably get Louis via for                                 now or we bribe him which other cakes                                 thank you that's like really good                                 suggestion Paul because that is that is                                 a resource that's missing but even with                                 them these concepts are difficult to to                                 condense into small things even even                                 grok law as great as it was it was                                 complicated to follow because these                                 these issues are are complicated so it                                 may be incorrect to try and you know put                                 it down to like two bullet points                                 any other questions folks okay great                                 well thank you all for coming and I                                 believe that we have one more talk                                 before the break am i lying to you                                 sorry is there one more talk before the                                 break or do we all go home there's one                                 more there's one more talk all right                                 excellent okay firstly thank you Chris                                 and Leslie                                 [Applause]
