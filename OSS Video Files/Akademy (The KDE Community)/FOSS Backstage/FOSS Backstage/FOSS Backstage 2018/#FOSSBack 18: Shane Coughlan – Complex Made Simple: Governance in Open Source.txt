Title: #FOSSBack 18: Shane Coughlan â€“ Complex Made Simple: Governance in Open Source
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Open source has always been about more than code. It is about how people work together and what they can accomplish as a community. Governance, or shared understanding of process and rules, became more important when open source scaled beyond small groups who knew each other well. Today we have a global community represented by many cultures using many languages. To accomplish this we have developed simple, understandable and effective governance structures. This talk will dive into the key principles that work for the real world.

	                              hi there everyone it's a it's a great                               pleasure to be here at Foss stage I was                               talking to Paul and it's Bell in two                               other organizers and saying it's hard to                               believe this is the first time that Foss                               backstage has been held it feels more                               like a conference that has been running                               for a while the audience is diverse                               networking with each other the speakers                                are interesting and represent a wide                                range of views it's a conference that I                                think out of the gate looks good sounds                                good and I will certainly be telling                                people about it now my keynote today is                                about how we run open source not from a                                development perspective not even from a                                business perspective per se but rather                                from the perspective of how do we manage                                the collaboration in this type of                                community I'm a political scientist so I                                look at issues like open source                                community with a slightly different                                perspective to many of the people who                                come from engineering or pure business                                backgrounds I'm interested in how do we                                take the complexity of human social                                dynamics create a situation where                                parties who don't know each other and                                have no natural reason to trust each                                other can nevertheless collaborate on                                technology for me open-source is                                particularly interesting because it is a                                method of collaborating that we haven't                                seen happen elsewhere as successfully                                open-source has provided a way for tens                                of thousands or perhaps even hundreds of                                thousands of individuals around the                                world to collaborate on shared                                technology platforms with a relatively                                high degree of confidence that what they                                give and what they get is predictable                                and fair                                now this brings me to the topic of open                                source governance open source compliance                                ensuring that people follow the rules in                                my view we're a long way from the point                                and open source where we were discussing                                is this license valid or how do I                                enforce this license or should I obey                                the license we're in a situation with                                open source for now people quite clearly                                understand that we have a certain set of                                rules codified in copyright that set a                                tone that set a way of interacting that                                allows us to build shared platforms this                                is now a well-established and well                                accepted fact for collaborators or                                participants of all sizes from                                individuals through to multinational                                corporations we've seen the acceptance                                of licenses using copyright law as the                                correct and balanced way to ensure                                fairness in open source the fact that we                                now all agree that the licenses work and                                we agree that we will follow them                                doesn't mean that our challenges around                                open source governance are over it means                                that we have a good solid baseline a                                great starting point but we still have                                plenty of questions along the lines of                                ok so now we know what the rules are and                                we know where the rules are located in                                the licenses do we in practical senses                                implement these rules in different areas                                for example I live in Japan and in Japan                                there are large automotive companies                                that are using open source and these                                companies essentially have a model of                                doing a lot of R&D then having their                                suppliers build a lot of technology and                                then the automotive company assembles                                the technology so in in some ways and                                this is a little bit frivolous                                but also not inaccurate modern car                                manufacturers our research and                                integration experts with their supply                                chain doing a lot of the building for                                companies like this they look at the                                supply chain they look at dozens or                                hundreds of companies involved in                                bringing a car to completion and they                                ask questions along the lines of ok so                                people are following the license that's                                great but how do we communicate that                                through the supply chain how do we                                ensure that each company while they're                                doing the right thing can communicate                                what they've done clearly to the                                customers throughout the supply chain                                 those types of governance questions                                 quite frankly seemed burdensome or                                 difficult to resolve it took us quite a                                 few years of trying to work this out                                 before we settled on the simple idea                                 that maybe we can help everyone meet the                                 requirements by having standards and                                 those standards can be clearly and                                 predictably communicated to participants                                 for a while                                 every company was trying to do their own                                 thing they were recording their progress                                 in documents like spreadsheets they were                                 doing things like scanning code and                                 hoping that was enough to verify that                                 their development process had covered                                 all the bases when we began to think of                                 the problem differently when we began to                                 think how do we ensure multiple parties                                 multiple legal entities can communicate                                 the information with fidelity without                                 losing data without misunderstandings we                                 began to understand clearly that every                                 company putting things in a spreadsheet                                 and sending it onward was making stuff                                 harder more complex and less accurate we                                 turned our minds to building an industry                                 standard that would explain roughly what                                 the key requirements of a quality                                 open-source                                 Grahame must be and how you can meet                                 those requirements                                 that's where open-chain came from it                                 originated in a conversation between a                                 handful of lawyers and the conversation                                 was basically that the companies as                                 customers of large supply chains the                                 companies knew what they wanted from                                 open source but their suppliers didn't                                 necessarily have the processes in place                                 to deliver that so these lawyers sat                                 down and began to draft some universal                                 requirements for open source compliance                                 simple requirements like do you have an                                 inbound software process do you have a                                 development process do you have a policy                                 do you have an outbound process simple                                 questions that if you answer yes to by                                 and large your organization will be able                                 to manage open source licenses and of                                 course you can answer this question if                                 you can manage the licenses you can                                 trust what's going on the open chain                                 standard started a few years ago and has                                 grown relatively quickly with very large                                 companies particularly in areas like                                 enterprise technology automotive and                                 consumer devices picking up on the idea                                 of having a shared approach to                                 governance to reduce complexity to                                 reduce investment required and to reduce                                 mistakes now this talk is entitled                                 complex made simple and the reason for                                 that is that I believe in                                                lot of talking points around open-source                                 compliance and governance we have                                 certain issues like we've seen                                 enforcement in Germany that has caused                                 some disruption in our industry this has                                 been discussed by the Linux kernel and                                 netfilter teams in the past                                 we've seen new participants entering                                 open-source entering software who are                                 learning from scratch about what to do                                 and we've seen some interesting not to                                 say tensions but moments of evolution as                                 our community as a whole                                 changes and as all of this has been                                 going on                                 we've had some dialogues suggesting that                                 governance and open source is somehow                                 lacking or somehow too complex or                                 somehow different from how we deal with                                 let's say proprietary software this                                 perception of complexity is something                                 that has caused us to pause and                                 reconsider how we're doing things how do                                 we try to reduce the perception of                                 complexity to ensure that people using                                 open-source are confident how do we make                                 things simpler not by reducing the                                 fidelity of something like governance or                                 the fidelity of compliance but by                                 pre-packaging as much of it as possible                                 as my American colleagues Mike might say                                 pre chewing it as much as possible so                                 we've been doing that I'm not sure if                                 you're familiar with the Linux                                 foundations open compliance program                                 Linux Foundation has gradually started                                 to make a large stack of projects and                                 solutions to address governance and                                 compliance open chain as a overarching                                 standard is perhaps at the top of the                                 stack just below it there's another                                 standard called SPD X that explains how                                 you can describe what's in a package in                                 a consistent manner so that everyone can                                 quickly read understand and also share                                 their data below that there's projects                                 like fossil adji for scanning code                                 outside of Linux foundation there are                                 also other interesting projects one new                                 project that started recently is                                 quartermaster                                 Mirko is right there he's running it                                 that's a CI CD project another project                                 that was recently released by a group of                                 people but particularly the Microsoft                                 open source team is clearly defined                                 which is a type of software catalog and                                 surrounding these various projects with                                 standards and tools we've got dozens and                                 dozens of publications that explain                                 what's going on how you can do it too                                 and how you can train and educate the                                 people in your organization using                                 open-source we're very close to making                                 the complex question of open source                                 governance simple we're very close to                                 being able to say ok go here and you'll                                 be walked through the answers to your                                 questions I'd say that during                                          can expect that capability to become                                 live right now I'm working on the open                                 compliance program website at Linux                                 Foundation with other members of the                                 team and admittedly we won't be                                 announcing the new website until                                 November but pre announcements never                                 hurt what we're looking at is having a                                 way to say are you a developer are you a                                 company or are you a project and when                                 you click through that you find all of                                 the information available that can help                                 you frame your thinking and solve                                 challenges related to governance                                 now I were an open chain which is one of                                 many projects but I do think that if you                                 watch open chain you'll be able to keep                                 track of how we're making the complexity                                 and governance a lot simpler                                 there's our URL and the reason that open                                 chain is a good place to keep track of                                 things is that we are only as standard                                 and some reference material but we point                                 outwards to everything else and because                                 we're on the top of the stack we're                                 pointing out to all of the interesting                                 projects around the place so hopefully                                 we'll be playing an instrumental role in                                 tying things together and making                                 governance as                                 simple as possible now switching gears I                                 talked about how open-source governance                                 is doing pretty well how we're making                                 standards how we're beginning to make it                                 easier to interact with your supply                                 chain and to interact with projects                                 around you at the same time as all of                                 this rosy news about everything going                                 really well I think it's worth                                 highlighting that sometimes we do face                                 interesting challenges I briefly                                 mentioned the challenges in the German                                 legal jurisdiction with compliance cases                                 in a challenging situation there was                                 that we saw a whole bunch of legal                                 claims against companies that did not                                 really seem to be motivated by ensuring                                 compliance but rather focused on a                                 profit motive and that caused some                                 concern disruption and uncertainty in                                 our community we also see challenges                                 coming in other areas I mentioned that                                 companies which have nothing to do with                                 open source or maybe nothing to do with                                 software in the past have begun adopting                                 open source technology just two months                                 ago I was talking to a very large                                 company involved in consumer products                                 consumable consumer products and this                                 company never used open source in fact                                 it was focused on business-to-business                                 until recently and but their new product                                 range they're pivoting their business to                                 customer and their back end is all open                                 source in the case of this particular                                 company they took a very wise                                 well-informed and careful approach                                 whereby they actually looked at the                                 community carefully and then decided to                                 adopt the community norms projects and                                 methodologies to reduce their time to                                 market but there are other companies                                 which are new to open source who arrive                                 in a state of uncertainty                                 and without clarity of what they should                                 do and they naturally make mistakes                                 that's a slight concern for our                                 community because if we don't reach out                                 and support these organizations if they                                 have a bad experience using open source                                 they might not continue and finally we                                 have challenges because open source                                 itself is truly evolving becoming much                                 larger than the individuals programming                                 code becoming much larger than any                                 company investing in it this change has                                 meant that to some extent the old method                                 of working with huge figure heads and                                 these inspirational inspirational figure                                 heads guiding the community is reducing                                 in favor of having much larger                                 communities with formal rule sets and                                 that that process of adjustment is not                                 always smooth and it does lead to some                                 tensions and these three things can lead                                 to serious concerns around governance                                 and predictability at the very beginning                                 of my talk I mentioned that open source                                 is a method of interacting it's a method                                 of people working together and if we                                 have uncertainty if we have tensions if                                 it's about lawsuits or companies who                                 don't know what to do or the tension of                                 communities evolving if the rules become                                 uncertain if the confidence and trust                                 fostered by those rules become uncertain                                 we lose efficiency we lose the ability                                 to collaborate and that truly is one of                                 my great concerns and one of the areas I                                 think we can make a great difference in                                 governance the complexity of something                                 like lawsuits or the complexity of                                 teaching companies how to use open                                 source or the complexity of managing                                 community transitions are something that                                 we are investing in right now rather                                 than neglecting this or waiting thing                                 things to hit a problem point we're                                 proactively investing in the projects                                 like open chain that are designed to                                 catch people give them a frame of                                 reference point them at solutions and                                 allow them to look at the other                                 organizations around them and feel                                 confident those organizations are doing                                 the same thing to end my keynote I                                 perhaps would like to set the tone for                                 the future free software open source if                                 there's one criticism that can be                                 leveled against it is that this area not                                 just in the last ten years perhaps since                                 inception is quite inward looking we                                 tend to look in at what we regard as the                                 core of our community we tend to look at                                 the technologies that perhaps we created                                 a very long time ago and still regard                                 them as central not from a perspective                                 of utilitarian solution or benefit but                                 with a sort of emotional attachment this                                 inward looking nature means that our                                 community can be so so close people can                                 arrive at an event and feel welcomed                                 instantly as long as they know the                                 secret handshake                                 but this insular nature also presents us                                 with perhaps the greatest challenge to                                 governance in open-source we are now                                 software everything that his software                                 contains open-source but the reason                                 open-source succeeded wasn't passion it                                 wasn't because of a normative good or                                 bad it was because it worked best it                                 solved more problems for more people                                 more efficiently and if we remain to                                 inward-looking in open source if we                                 continually self-reference ourselves if                                 we continually hold various items for                                 example not                                 to pick a particular text editor but                                 text editors which are decades old and                                 regard them as Sacre sent simply because                                 they exist if we get stuck inside                                 ourselves we might miss the terrific                                 opportunities of the future and by those                                 opportunities I mean things like the                                 massive advances coming in artificial                                 intelligence the massive massive                                 advantages and developments coming in                                 structure infrastructure automotive                                 areas that we are going to make a huge                                 impact as software but we perhaps need                                 to be a little bit more open and                                 inclusive to make an impact as a                                 community one thing I hope and I would                                 like to put out to you as an idea today                                 is that in our community it might be a                                 really good time for us to go back and                                 think some of the ways that we've                                 governed open source for decades are                                 working well the fundamentals codified                                 in licenses that's working well but some                                 of the other aspects of the open source                                 community the pre assumption that were                                 dominated by individual hackers doing                                 amazing things or the pre assumptions                                 dominated that a particular license type                                 is inherently more advantageous than                                 another these ideas might bear some                                 reflection and perhaps adjustment we                                 might benefit from new books talking                                 about how the open source community                                 today is so vibrant talking about why                                 for example in China Baidu released                                 autonomous car software as open-source                                 last year things like that are                                 incredible accomplishments they're                                 wonderful examples of how the                                 open-source community is growing and                                 evolving                                 we just need perhaps a little bit more                                 documentation about that                                 and given that you all have so much                                 experience I think my call to you would                                 be to consider being part of that you                                 know blogging about what's happening                                 around our community today what's                                 happening in society and how open-source                                 fits into that so internally an                                 open-source are basic questions of                                 license compliance how to work together                                 we're doing fine and during this year in                                 particular you'll get some great                                 information about how projects companies                                 and individuals can address open-source                                 top to bottom on the compliance and                                 governance side pulling back on the                                 bigger picture of governance about                                 community and society we might need to                                 reflect a little bit about how things                                 have changed in the last                                              where we might benefit from new essays                                 new books new inspirations to help                                 ensure that our community today supports                                 the outside community and brings them in                                 as best possible for tomorrow so thank                                 you very much for your time and your                                 attention I really appreciate it and I'm                                 around this event at any time if you                                 have questions or comments and also now                                 I believe we have a minute or two for                                 questions so I did see my MC wife mildly                                 waving a flag card yeah please                                 personally thank to Shane :                                 thank you and we still have a couple of                                 minutes maybe four questions since we                                 have a delay of like five maximum -                                    minutes - every session till the lunch                                 so I'm coming for the question so we                                 have a question from this gentleman                                 Shane first of all before I come up with                                 my question I really like to thank you                                 what you're doing with open chain brings                                 is some kind of delight of the end of a                                 dark tunnel to us before this                                 initiatives for for us as a company                                 using open source was splitted in a part                                 that is very transparent and that's the                                 code on the other side this legal part                                 very on the dark side of even if we try                                 to talk to other companies they say how                                 we will not tell you how we handle this                                 and this is not the way all open-source                                 should be so really thank you for this                                 initiative and now my question what is                                 you wish how can we all support this                                 initiatives to bring open-source make it                                 completely transparent on the code side                                 and on the legal side so what can we all                                 do it's a really good question and a                                 valuable question sometimes we do face a                                 situation where people come to our                                 community and they they say that that's                                 great what do I do when it comes to                                 improving governance contributing to the                                 future of that joining something like                                 the open chain mailing list and                                 contributing to discussions about future                                 specifications is useful but I think                                 more generally to help the community at                                 large getting case studies or getting                                 contributions of reference policies or                                 just reference process outlines is                                 something that we see immediately                                 impacting people so when open chain                                 started we were focused on the idea of                                 let's make this standard the                                 specification                                 and to support it we made some training                                 slides reference training slides and we                                 thought these slides would be used to                                 help meet the specification but as soon                                 as we put them out there the slides just                                 went everywhere all over the world some                                 people were using it for open-chain a                                 lot of people were using it for other                                 things they were revamping their                                 internal training programs they were                                 sending them to their suppliers there is                                 huge demand in the global open source                                 space for case studies and examples so                                 that's where you can make the biggest                                 impact and what's interesting is that no                                 matter what that example is it will be                                 useful so if a developer makes a quick                                 note about how they let's say contribute                                 to a project that is useful it's                                 immensely useful and in some countries                                 like Korea many companies until recently                                 wouldn't allow their developers to even                                 access services like github those were                                 blocked so now they're unblocking that                                 but the developers are really just                                 getting up to speed they're desperate                                 for material to see how they can do                                 things properly if you go to open chain                                 project and just join our mailing list                                 you can send in reference material at                                 any time we are also releasing templates                                 for one page or one presentation slide                                 case studies these case studies are just                                 crazy useful they're useful as reference                                 for actual processes but we also found                                 they're really useful to go and talk to                                 management which has been one of the                                 very important things automotive                                 probably leads the way yesterday Toyota                                 was running an open chain event in                                 Nagoya and they announced three                                 automotive case studies which are now on                                 the open chain website and we we know                                 that there's another automotive case                                 study coming out today which is actually                                 going to be rather than an anonymous                                 case study it will be a named toyota                                 case study and those going out                                 immediately get attention and                                 immediately get pickup I don't want to                                 go on too long on this point but I would                                 like to talk about                                 just the license related to this when it                                 came to licensing the material in open                                 chain we put the specification under a                                 CC license which was relatively                                 restricted so that the standard would be                                 very stable but we put all of our                                 reference material all of our training                                 material everything else under CC zero                                 effectively public domain and that was                                 critical I think in allowing people to                                 adopt it because they could include it                                 in their own company material or their                                 project material they don't even need to                                 mention where it comes from and that                                 that really worked so thank you for                                 Shane Coughlin again thank you                                 [Applause]
