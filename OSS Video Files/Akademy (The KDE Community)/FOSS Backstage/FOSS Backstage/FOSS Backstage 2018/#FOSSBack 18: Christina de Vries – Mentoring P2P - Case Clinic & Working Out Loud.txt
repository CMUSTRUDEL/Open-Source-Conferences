Title: #FOSSBack 18: Christina de Vries â€“ Mentoring P2P - Case Clinic & Working Out Loud
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	In a world strongly demanding self-organization and participation, there is an urgent need for mentoring ways that didn't originate in traditional HR or top-down approaches. Peer coaching methods will become the foundation of independent and self-paced advancement and will also facilitate networking within companies and even beyond.

I will introduce two techniques that are available for everyone, quickly realizable, and yet location- and equipment-independently usable - the Presencing Institute's "Case Clinic" and John Stepper's "Working Out Loud".

	                              welcome good morning everybody and thank                               you for joining me                               yeah this is what I will do I will talk                               about case cleaning and working out loud                               to open source mentoring techniques that                               may help you in your future now that you                               know who I am I want to get a notion who                               you are so could you just raise a hand                               who has been a mentee before or is a                                mentee at the moment not so many okay                                and who has been a mentor before or is a                                mentor at the moment Oh even more that                                is interesting well so when we think of                                mentoring we tend to think of mentoring                                as a magical process when somebody jumps                                into the first mentoring they think                                we've had somebody would just point the                                magic one at them and all the knowledge                                all the experience just would flow                                through but of course that is not the                                case and mentoring is always a unique                                opportunity to serve someone else and to                                serve yourself as well so to lay the                                ground for the two mentoring tools that                                I will show you today I have three                                truths about mentoring and one surprise                                that I came across again and again over                                the last two decades                                so truth number one of course everyone                                can be a mentor it doesn't have to be                                the most valuable professional or the                                most published author everyone can be a                                mentor so if you look at the person next                                to you right now                                they could be your mentor and you could                                be theirs everyone has a unique                                perspective and something to share that                                you don't know truth number two                                mentoring isn't necessarily about the                                what so if you want to proceed to                                advance in development and coding or                                something you do not need to ask another                                developer you may ask an artist how they                                won't manage to proceed in their                                advancement so it can also be about the                                how and of course mentoring can                                be about the houl and the when and the                                best cases it's also about the why why                                are you going to do this truth number                                three you'll never be done being a                                mentee because times change of course                                and there's so much to learn for you all                                your life long so why should we stop                                doing this and why should we stop                                passing along the knowledge and the                                ideas and inspiration so of course you                                should always be a mentor as well so the                                one surprise I brought to you is                                mentoring can also be done in                                           and they also is in italics because this                                is not the only solution there is a wide                                range of mentoring techniques and                                possibilities but there is also the                                opportunity to do mentoring in just that                                short amount of time so the first                                question you would have to ask yourself                                is what is your exact mentoring need so                                do you have an idea for your advancement                                is it a new orientation do you need some                                some feedback for this and some company                                for the way so an ongoing mentoring                                method would be the choice for you but                                is it something specific right now is it                                a question is it a current problem is it                                a situation you feel stuck in so in a                                top mentoring method would be something                                that could suit you best so let's look                                at this one first so your open source                                often one is the ad-hoc mentoring method                                with the case clinic from the presencing                                Institute which I'd say works like a                                strong espresso for exact this moment                                where you need it                                the presencing Institute has launched                                the you lab with the MIT and when I                                joined in                                                               EDX platform I got to learn about the                                case clinic during this course of the U                                lab which takes eight weeks or longer                                you get to know several tools and one                                tool was the case clinic where complete                                strangers we're set up in coaching                                circles in mind where one from Brazil                                one from Cyprus and one from one so we                                were four people spread all over the                                world and one                                yeah just jumped into the first case and                                it is a case giver that you need the                                others are coaches in that moment and                                 you proceed through seven steps then and                                 the case giver presents the problem and                                 the others just listen and then you do                                 not jump into this idea of quick                                 solutions that we tend to have when                                 someone raises an issue but you think                                 about you reflect and you for example                                 paint a picture or something that                                 resonates with you and then the coaches                                 start to talk about what came to their                                 mind and the case giver is only                                 listening in this moment about how the                                 others think about the issue think about                                 this person's involvement in the issue                                 and possible solutions and that is very                                 interesting because you get a deeper                                 level of understanding and a deeper                                 connection because although we were                                 complete strangers we could provide a                                 really valuable solutions for the case                                 giver that was really interesting for me                                 that this worked so                                                      and maybe a problem is solved that you                                 couldn't solve yourself today the the                                 case clinic is available online with the                                 timer tool so you have the seven steps                                 you have an overview how much time is                                 there left what is supposed to happen in                                 that step and what I like very much                                 about it is then that when the timer is                                 done it doesn't give you ring so you can                                 just proceed when you're in the middle                                 of something it won't interrupt you and                                 then you go from step to step until you                                 come to the closing                                 remarks by the case giver and the                                 thank-you note and the timer tool guides                                 you through all this process if you need                                 to dive deeper into a case clinic and                                 maybe also a theory you and the you lab                                 there are introductory videos like this                                 one with Adam and Otto from the                                 presencing Institute at the MIT                                 there are also printouts available the                                 case clinic is there in English as well                                 as German and so you can decide in the                                 group whether you just put it on the                                 table and go through the sheets or if                                 you choose the timer tool to get into                                 the procedure so why should you try this                                 out it can be your mentoring tool when                                 you have something you think about and                                 you need help with that is specific and                                 that is happening at the moment and you                                 should be part of the problem meaning                                 you are into it and you should be able                                 to be a part of the solution if you try                                 it you have insights with relevance you                                 have the opportunity to really grab that                                 chance                                 it is very simple and lightweight no                                 more resources needed and it's of course                                 free and open source and if you have a                                 mentoring need that is not something for                                 just a moment if you have a question or                                 an idea for your advancement that asks                                 for more guidance over time then the                                 second open-source mentoring option                                 might be yours and this is                                          working out loud by John stepper and if                                 we think of the case clinic as the                                 strongest presser for right now working                                 out loud is more like the tea ceremony                                 that endures over time that has several                                 steps that need to be followed and the                                 steps are a bit smaller maybe and yeah                                 the way is part                                 of the solution so my first working out                                 loud circle was very small we started                                 with only                                                               are well manageable and we had totally                                 different goals you come to the working                                 out loud circle with your personal goal                                 where do I want to go what do I want to                                 do so these are the question people come                                 with and have ideas what they are going                                 to to do are going to learn or whatever                                 you name it and we went from week to                                 week with the                                                          one for every week and we get deeper and                                 deeper into it and by week five I think                                 we were able to just go with the flow we                                 were really arrived in that idea and we                                 started switching exercises we started                                 skipping some and we also paused and                                 said okay let's stop with this week we                                 just sit in a coffee shop sit down in a                                 coffee shop and chat a bit about what's                                 going on at the moment and that was                                 worth the time of course so if you look                                 at working out loud you may find the                                 website regardless come when you of                                 course have a lot of information the                                 introductions TED talk by John of course                                 some charts for example like this five                                 elements of working out loud which                                 accord to it it's about the mindset it's                                 about networking and sharing and this is                                 what the circle guide looks like for in                                 this case we gate so you have suggestion                                 for the agenda you have time boxed parts                                 in there and then you go through the                                 exercises or as I said you can skip them                                 and because of the weekly hour you spent                                 together this is                                                        least it's supposed to be the group                                 grows together and you get to know each                                 other better and yourself of course and                                 he grow your network within the group                                 and beyond because this is part of                                 working out loud                                 I asked John why he would think that                                 working out loud is perfect for                                 peer-to-peer mentoring and he said that                                 especially the balance between the                                 structure and flexibility is what makes                                 it so compelling you have this frame                                 wherein you can act as if you want and                                 the group has the choice to meet the                                 group's need and this is what well yeah                                 makes it so easy to just jump into it                                 and use it for yourself and of course to                                 have a to have a space where you can                                 experiment and when you can share what                                 you what you think what you heard what                                 you are up to and also of course your                                 failures where you where you get stuck                                 and you don't know any further this is                                 very very valuable for all the others                                 and I can say it was very rewarding for                                 me and the circles stick afterwards so                                 why should you go and try out the                                 working out loud you have three months                                 almost three months of support from                                 peers and it doesn't it's not only about                                 peers within your company it can also be                                 beyond of course within your community                                 or with another company who has                                 interested people and you can shape the                                 circle experience yourself you find the                                 fellows and of course it's free and open                                 source and you have a global community                                 you can draw from so now we had the                                 coffee and the tea and it both comes                                 with cookies of course you have the                                 choice of the participants there is no                                 program that tells you this is your                                 mentor and this is your peer and you                                 need to be in there and there no you                                 pick the people that are interested in                                 doing this you just can start right away                                 you modify where it's necessary this is                                 up to you of course and you can benefit                                 from what's already there where should                                 you start you should find the people                                 form a circle decide on the technique if                                 the current problem is it something that                                 needs an ongoing support arrange for                                 time and space                                 this is crucial because this isn't                                 something that will happen on the go you                                 need to have some time blocked for this                                 because it's very essential that's it                                 that you commit yourselves to it so this                                 is my part thank you very much for                                 listening and well if there is a                                 question ask me now ask me later or                                 reach out thank you                                 [Music]                                 would there be any questions to                                 Christina well we have a couple of time                                 left so not so much comment but thank                                 you for this presentation there is a                                 another open source mentoring tool that                                 I've been watching that I think is                                 tailored more towards if you have a                                 specific path that you want your mentees                                 to go through                                 it's called Exorcism IO heard about but                                 I'm not into it I have to admit yeah                                 yeah no it's just pretty interesting I                                 just thought I'd throw it out there yeah                                 this cool pair exe are not like the                                 religious act thank you                                 so oh yeah I don't know if that's like                                 really in scope but I was wondering if                                 you could so all the techniques you                                 described are kind of like you know very                                 personal direct interaction and I was                                 wondering if you could tell me how to                                 translate that to open source                                 communities like I mean we try to like                                 have open processes and have mailing                                 lists and Revie bots and that kind of                                 thing and it's it's a little it's less                                 personal and it's it's still the kind of                                 mentoring tool we use and it's not                                 really perfect sometimes you have any                                 suggestions yeah well I think it always                                 starts with yourself so where they start                                 not in the hole you start it yourself                                 and your neighbors start at theirs and I                                 know that working out loud has become a                                 movement during the last two years and                                 they're they yeah kind of arranged for a                                 big conference meetings for working out                                 loud community for example at Porsche                                 and demons so big corporations hundred                                 thousands of people what I try to get                                 those into the network that really need                                 to talk to each other and that really                                 need to want to proceed to advance and                                 to get to know more and not only theirs                                 and I think in the communities it's it's                                 a bit the same you are so stuck in your                                 aspect of the idea so that yeah this on                                 a higher level on a community level                                 should be arranged like in a conference                                 so this is the idea that I know about                                 and this works for those corporations                                 the other thing is that those who has                                 who have already passed kind of passed                                 or done working out a lot circle go on                                 and do a second and a third one like me                                 so you get to know other people and you                                 spread the word and making it a habit                                 was put there it changes you in a bit                                 so of course sharing is part of your                                 business but how you share and how you                                 network and how you reach out becomes a                                 bit different and thus it becomes more                                 open and maybe this helps the mindset                                 change thank you for the question as we                                 run out of time thank you very much                                 Kristina thanks for any for all the                                 comments and questions and I will I'm                                 sure you can get connected with                                 Christina and the sponsors area at                                 lunchtime or some time else thank you                                 very much                                 [Music]
