Title: #FOSSBack 18: Shane Curcuru – Who Owns That Open Source Brand?
Publication date: 2018-06-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Do you really know who owns the brand behind the top open source projects you rely on? Code is infinitely forkable; brands and communities are not. Engage in an interactive session reviewing top open source projects, and be surprised when you learn which projects are truly independent, and which are really vendor-owned, and how well their governance model works.

You don’t have to get involved in branding: but you do need to know who truly controls the direction of the open source technologies that you rely on every day. Far too many individual developers and companies rely on a wide variety of open source tools that come from different projects. How do you accurately evaluate the security, stability, and potential for future support around an open source project? How can you find if your chief competitor truly has a lock on a project’s governance and future direction? How well do projects define their governance, and what are the chances for hidden power struggles behind the scenes?

The power behind a project’s brand is not always obvious. Come discover who governs some key open source project brands, and what might happen to governance when someone goes IPO or gets bought out. Learn how to keep governance of the project truly independent and welcoming – or how to properly own and run your own open source brand.

Understanding the brand, governance, and background of any FOSS project is critical to understanding where the project is going in the future - and if you can rely on them for your work.

	                              having a lovely time here in Berlin at a                               fostex stage and we want to talk about                               something a little different there have                               been certainly a number talks about                               business but in terms business of open                               source but the brands behind open source                               is something that many of the                               technologists of us don't think about as                               much so as for me I founded my own                                consulting company in terms of helping                                people understand open source from both                                business and and the geek side and I                                serve as a the vice chairman of the                                Apache Software Foundation so it worked                                a lot with all Apache projects in terms                                of how they present their brands of                                course they are open-source brands which                                is a little bit different than what we                                traditionally think of when we think of                                a brand or a trademark and just a                                disclaimer because that's important in                                some jurisdictions I am NOT a lawyer                                neither in the EU or Germany or the US                                so no this is legal advice just                                reminding people that sort of make I                                don't get in trouble later on so I'd                                like to talk about brands and trademarks                                and open source and sometimes people                                think that they don't actually go                                together                                and they do they absolutely do and it's                                very important to understand that and                                many people don't unchain the details                                why trademarks matter it really does                                matter to your project if you want to                                succeed over the long term and one                                metaphor that's gonna be important is we                                all talk about open source but that's                                sort of a that's a broad term there is a                                specific definition but it means a lot                                of things to different people                                we really need to talk about three                                different levels of how open a project                                whether it's a community or a codebase                                can be I think will be very valuable and                                we'll have quiz time so some of this                                will be surprises in terms of do you                                actually know who owns the brand behind                                different projects from my perspective                                code community and brand or the three                                one way to think of any project and we                                talk about the rest of Berlin buzzwords                                and Apache Roadshow is talking about                                code that's the least interesting for                                thinking about projects and community                                and something living over a longer                                period of time open source is infinitely                                for Keable that's by design                                you know I can have my code you have                                your code as the same stuff doesn't                                matter community they are the people who                                draw                                project there are the activities that                                are happening that are vibrant that                                makes something interesting to have it                                have direction that's constantly                                changing because companies decide to                                internally make a different business                                decision or because volunteers you know                                have an emergency at home can't show up                                or volunteers or suddenly very                                passionate about things brand is the                                image of the whole project and that's                                far more powerful than we think of it                                for most of us in our day to day life                                when we're working an open-source                                project or when we're at work and                                deciding which technology to use and I                                often find it's the least understood in                                most of our communities now certainly                                there are some so are there any                                marketers here today okay so you guys                                yeah I'm you know I'm not gonna teach                                you anything but the rest of us I think                                don't think about that side as much so I                                will pause it that an open source                                projects most important asset is its                                brand so we'll see at the end of this                                talk if you you know agree with me or                                you think I'm crazy right now you                                probably think I'm a little crazy                                because cool technology or great people                                but so let's think about some popular                                open source brands and then figure out                                who owns them and who actually is behind                                some of the brands in a project so we                                have a quiz time I don't have to be you                                know extra big because it's right before                                lunch one to make sure you stay awake                                 okay so we are gonna go through who owns                                 this brand or this trademark so who can                                 actually control the brand a material of                                 the code immaterial to the community so                                 here we have the level below Hadoop                                 elephant which I have brought along with                                 me not for sale so who owns this brand                                 that is it that cloudy company I can't                                 remember the name is it that horton e                                 company I'm not gonna say the name is it                                 a business trade association sort of                                 something like it's like the Linux                                 Foundation where it's companies together                                 is it a non-profit charity                                 like Apache or software freedom                                 Conservancy or is it Doug cutting okay                                 because it's with Doug cutting I was                                 actually named it so who owns this in                                 terms of the brain                                 in terms what it is well hopefully we                                 had thought of the right answer which is                                 a non-profit charity so Apache Hadoop is                                 a registered trademark of the Apache                                 Software Foundation and in the u.s. were                                 a                                                                   public charity we're not beholden to any                                 corporate interests here here's another                                 question who owns this brand which I                                 think most of us recognize we may or may                                 not have played with the little Arduino                                 computers but who is behind use of the                                 trademark who is the the person who can                                 legally control how we or how somebody                                 presents it you know obviously there a                                 lot of developers working on it and                                 hardware manufacturers is it really a                                 commercial company that is trying to                                 make money is it a trade association who                                 want to build ecosystems but really it's                                 the member companies that are                                 controlling them and benefiting from                                 that ecosystem is it a non-profit                                 charity or is it a BF DL or an                                 individual so that's a benevolent                                 dictator for life so there's some open                                 popular open source projects where                                 essentially the person who found it has                                 sort of a perpetual veto over things and                                 they act as a as a leader for the                                 project which is implicit                                 they often you know they invite other                                 input but they have the final say so                                 this one is actually interesting because                                 there was a lot of controversy over this                                 because there actually were two Arduinos                                 for a while in different countries and                                 they started suing each other over the                                 trademark which is unfortunate cost a                                 lot and detracts from the work we want                                 to do so now they have about two years                                 ago they finally stopped fighting in                                 court over trademarks because that's                                 never a good idea and it's expensive and                                 actually finally talked and decided to                                 merge the ownership so currently this                                 registered trademark Arduino not the                                 logo but the the name is owned by                                 Arduino AG Switzerland as a registered                                 trademark and they are a commercial                                 company and they have worked to bring                                 their community back together which is a                                 good thing but they spend a lot of work                                 fighting back and forth over fine a sell                                 these Arduinos and that out those                                 Arduinos and in trademark law you can't                                 do that hopefully this is a simple one                                 the world's most popular blogging                                 platform every recognize this I hope so                                 who owns this brand well that would be                                 another nonprofit charity so we all know                                 that Matt Mullenweg founded this and is                                 a sort of a leader in the within the                                 project but they founded a separate                                 nonprofit foundation WordPress                                 foundation who owns this trademark now                                 automatic the company that hosts                                 WordPress and that's the commercial                                 company behind it shares a lot of the                                 people and allow the directors a                                 leadership as the wordpress foundation                                 but legally the nonprofit owns the                                 trademark which is an important                                 distinction because then they can hold                                 it for the community and the better                                 better good so you might say okay those                                 are kind of interesting we we recognize                                 them i didn't know X but why are brands                                 important right because brands the the                                 public perception of your project                                 that's how the public hears about you                                 that's how newcomers will find you when                                 they're searching or will hear about you                                 at a conference and decide to go look                                 open-source is fundamentally an                                 attention economy so in terms of the                                 projects we rely on getting enough                                 attention so that people will use us                                 which is great will give us feedback and                                 will become committers or contributors                                 so we can improve our project right we                                 don't have a company behind us that can                                 decide to hire more engineers we need to                                 be visible and attract people but brands                                 overall I mean we can talk with                                 marketers but that's a huge topic that's                                 kind of out of our scope so let's drill                                 down a little bit in terms of a brand is                                 everything you think about the logo and                                 the name and the way things look and a                                 trademark is a very specific thing so I                                 my phrases a trademark is the legal                                 instantiation of a brand so there's no                                 law about brands but there are very                                 specific laws in every country about use                                 of trademarks so                                 here's where we have another little                                 secret game look around you and I'm                                 gonna go to the next slide and if we're                                 gonna spot the lawyers because when I go                                 to the next slide if there are any                                 lawyers in here they're gonna twitch                                 okay so keep an eye out right so we're                                 gonna go over trademark law in                                    seconds okay                                 now any trademark lawyer would be like                                 but so a trademark is is the legal                                 instantiation or brand so there's law                                 around it it's a very specific                                 trademarks are very specific and                                 consistent symbols so around many                                 open-source projects there's you know                                 how we talk about Drupal or the latest                                 release or the codename for the latest                                 release or the little blue icon for it                                 those are all different parts the                                 trademarks are the little icon and the                                 word Drupal the rest is part of the                                 brand but the trademarks are there a                                 specific thing of how we associate a                                 name with a good or service and really                                 the hard part about thinking about what                                 trademark law is really trying to do is                                 as us as producers an open source it's                                 not really trying to help us it does                                 help us but trademark law is really                                 designed to prevent consumer confusion                                 use your confusion about the source of                                 goods                                 it's about our image to the world and we                                 have a legal definition of US Pacific                                 part of this image the name of our                                 project and associating the users who                                 will see that image then can understand                                 that software that comes from Drupal                                 comes from the people behind Drupal and                                 it's not some you know random                                 SourceForge user who's uploaded some                                 drupal whatever and you download it it's                                 not what you thought okay trademark law                                 is really about associating that symbol                                 in the minds of a user or consumer with                                 the organization that's providing that                                 product that is what trademark allows                                 for and that's easy to see in terms of                                 physical goods like coca-cola if it has                                 that shaped bottle you know it came from                                 coca-cola and you know how it will taste                                 because it's not somebody else                                 the important part there is that                                 consumers associate a trademark with a                                 producer that has consistent goods for                                 whatever the product is                                 which means trademarks by law and by                                 function can only be owned by a single                                 organization so there can only be one                                 legal owner of the Hadoop name at least                                 in in each country every country has                                 their own trademark law who that symbol                                 is associated with that that                                 organization or country or company or                                 individual so you can use trademark law                                 to prevent other people from using the                                 name Hadoop for a software product but                                 to sort of put all that in simpler terms                                 why are trademarks this part of brand                                 important is because trademarks are not                                 for Keable so code is designed to be for                                 Keable community can split off and                                 fracture because people want to move in                                 different directions whatever trademarks                                 cannot be for it                                 you can try and somebody can you know                                 point you out in the marketplace and                                 show you're a bad actor and somebody can                                 come sue you                                 which will happen but is not usually a                                 good idea to do so the point is whoever                                 controls the trademark legally and and                                 usually in the marketplace is where                                 people will come for that product and                                 then they will get the source from there                                 so you can fork code all you want but                                 people aren't going to follow you to                                 that new fork so the important question                                 is then when we're trying to evaluate a                                 project we're going to use or that we                                 want to contribute to spend our time on                                 who owns the trademark behind that                                 project and that's not always clear we                                 often know some of the people working in                                 the in the open-source community but we                                 don't always know who's behind the                                 scenes                                 so here's old-fashioned one who do                                 people remember this there is this like                                 we've already gone past our social                                 consciousness so who owns this                                 long-lived open-source brand is it a                                 commercial company is it a trade                                 association which is like the Linux                                 Foundation is it a non-profit charity                                 like Apache or is it a individual                                 person a benevolent dictator well that's                                 a trick question a little bit it's owned                                 by a commercial company by Oracle now                                 and it's not open source Solaris as as a                                 product is no longer open source                                 whatsoever so that kind of doesn't count                                 and that's because Oracle owns the                                 trademark they bought it from Sun and                                 they decided they didn't want to be open                                 source anymore so I stopped they changed                                 nothing you do about that so maybe we're                                 thinking about a new database technology                                 for something we need so who owns the                                 allowable Maria DB seal this commercial                                 non profit individual so we want to                                 consider if we're gonna invest in using                                 them as a technology what's their future                                 direction to be and whoever's behind the                                 project not just the people working on                                 it but whoever's behind it control some                                 of that well in this case it's more a DB                                 corporation a B this is owned by the                                 trademark is owned by a commercial                                 company now there is a Maria DB                                 foundation that governs much of the                                 governance and work that happens in that                                 project but a commercial company owns                                 the trademark so this is the opposite of                                 WordPress earlier on the commercial                                 company if they decided to could                                 essentially change the direction because                                 they own the trademark so why is this                                 important for your company if you're                                 thinking of using a software product or                                 investing it well understanding the                                 brand ownership or the trademark                                 ownership is risk management so                                 understanding who's behind it where                                 they're going if they're a commercial                                 company they may well be a competitor                                 and that may be an issue if you end up                                 wanting to really get into the project                                 understanding the the project velocity                                 and maintenance so is is there a really                                 solid community behind it or big company                                 or is it you know not necessarily                                 defined yet so over the long term that                                 may make a difference of where the                                 project goes how well they maintain it                                 and a key one is if you want to change                                 the technology so you want to add                                 something and make that a value add or                                 market a disruptor then when you                                 contribute to that open source project                                 will you be able to have a say in the                                 future direction right whoever both in                                 the code and community level but as well                                 as                                 brand ownership are they willing to give                                 you a seat at the table or are they a                                 commercial company who will say oh                                 that's great we love your code and we're                                 gonna go do this so we'll just do a                                 couple quick examples who recognizes                                 this brand does anybody recognize this                                 one                                 what I'll have to see a little bit                                 esoteric this was the node forward Fork                                 of nodejs so or early-ish on in the note                                 j s lifetime a bunch of contributors                                 decided to fork of course when they fork                                 they took all the code that was great                                 they took some contributors not many but                                 they couldn't take the name so they had                                 to come up with a new name and a new                                 logo which none of us remember now so it                                 wasn't very useful nobody followed them                                 they didn't last very long                                 they fizzled out so do we recognize this                                 brand                                 well I oh no apparently not okay well                                 this was a major project fork from                                 nodejs by some significant contributors                                 who had real technical differences and                                 went ahead and actually built some new                                 and changed features in nodejs so                                 between                                                           separate project they attracted some                                 other attention got some velocity and                                 then a few people decide got them to                                 agree okay this technology is better                                 let's merge back that was a good thing                                 but they spent a lot of effort building                                 up that brand to get that attention that                                 could have been done could have been                                 still in the same project so having to                                 use a new brand is expensive who                                 recognizes this brand which is more                                 recent                                 oh yeah it's a couple people recognize                                 this well that's great because this is a                                 o or pronounced I Oh Jas just like the                                 last that one if you pronounce it they                                 sound the same                                 this was a fork of nodejs again in                                      now some contributors had social                                 differences and community governance                                 differences with the nodejs                                 leadership so they forked because they                                 had a better way to do things took all                                 the code had to go up with a new name                                 and to be frank not really many people                                 follow them their last commit was in                                 December of                                      their effect will be dead but again if                                 they had kept their energy in the main                                 project it would have been much better                                 it's much harder to go out and create                                 your own brand and then try and get the                                 same richness that something like nodejs                                 has so who recognizes this brand okay                                 that's just a silly question that's                                 pretty obvious people who know das brot                                 that's the node J us project but let's                                 go back to my earlier question who owns                                 this brand or the trademark behind it                                 rather let me be specific there this is                                 the one that nobody's successfully                                 forked everybody and either ended up                                 dying or coming back to this same root                                 project in terms of that's right so this                                 one I I was surprised when I finally                                 figured this out a commercial company                                 owns this trademark and I just heard                                 somebody in the audience go oh I'm glad                                 I'm surprised somebody no js' is under                                 the code governance is under the node.js                                 foundation which is part of the Linux                                 Foundation so essentially the project                                 governance is under                                                  trade association right that's what                                 people think about but when that all                                 happened Joyent                                 incorporated who originally founded                                 nodejs and brought it to the Linux                                 Foundation they kept control of the                                 trademark and by the way Joyent                                 incorporated is actually owned by                                 Samsung so legally Samsung owns the                                 trademark rights to nodejs does that                                 matter I don't know probably not because                                 the project's well enough establish in                                 his core but you know if you're a                                 serious competitor of Samsung or                                 something they might not want to let you                                 in so here's the I've done research I                                 apologize to my European colleagues I've                                 done research into u.s. trademark                                 ownership this one I'm confident is also                                 owned in the EU but here's the actual                                 URL to look it up so imagine if one way                                 to look at it is imagine if all the                                 efforts and all these Forks had gone                                 into innovation together if they had                                 either they had been a willing able to                                 continue the project velocity with the                                 existing project that would just be cool                                 and how hard it was for the forks to                                 gain enough attention to be viable to be                                 interesting they spent a lot of energy                                 coming up with a new brand and then                                 getting the attention which wasn't                                 energy on what is the code can be and                                 how are we gonna solve more problems so                                 understanding who's controlling the                                 brand is unimportant to see sort of you                                 know will you be able to influence the                                 strategic project direction or not so                                 we're at Faust backstage where were                                 individuals who participate in open                                 source most of us so why is this                                 important to me as a contributor right                                 why do I care as an individual that I                                 want to get involved in a project or use                                 it or start a consulting business about                                 it that's another question so on our                                 side you want your voice to be heard                                 right if you're gonna go submit code if                                 you're gonna step in you want to be able                                 to know how can I participate in project                                 governance right do is there a way that                                 if I show my merit that they'll like                                 elect me as a committer that eventually                                 I can be on the advisory board or the                                 technical board for this project and to                                 another degree a lot of open-source                                 engineers this is part of our resume                                 this is part of our you know brand so                                 will we be able to show reputation that                                 we get in this project will that be                                 valuable outside to other people right                                 that that we were like yes we're a                                 debian project contributor right that's                                 useful because people understand Debian                                 and they will welcome you in if you are                                 doing the work they'll make you a                                 contributor there are some projects who                                 won't you know there'd be like great and                                 thanks for the code but you know you                                 don't have a seat at our table well this                                 can be important here's another example                                 we have the dapper Butler here who                                 recognizes the name for this project                                 little okay couple of you'll call people                                 this was Hudson a continuous integration                                 server CV it it is Hudson not many                                 people use it anymore                                 the trademark behind this is owned by a                                 commercial company it's owned by Oracle                                 so the story behind this is that some                                 community members wanted to change                                 functionality add things nuts and                                 corkle wasn't giving us heat at the                                 table wasn't letting them make the                                 changes so they could make the changes                                 locally but they wanted to collaborate                                 on something new so why is that                                 important you don't have a seat                                 but who recognises this logo this dapper                                 Butler logo when the developers were                                 unhappy they forked the code and they                                 created a new brand which is a little                                 bit close to the other one I mean a                                 trademark lawyer might complain about                                 the butler standing that way but it's                                 Jenkins it's not Hudson that's fine so                                 the the question is they went in for                                 successfully because several of us                                 recognized this one and don't recognize                                 the other one my question is who owns                                 the trademark behind this somebody is                                 somebody trying to have a guess this one                                 is owned by a non-profit charity so the                                 the I don't know half a dozen code                                 contributors who simply said we're gonna                                 go fork this they forked it the camp of                                 the name just as individuals did the                                 work and start getting popular                                 they went to software in the public                                 interest which is a us-based nonprofit                                 who owns you know IP sort of gives you a                                 legal home to hang your hat on can                                 provide some fundraising and so on but                                 then the project community completely                                 governs the code rection and they're                                 secure that you know if one individual                                 gets bought by some big company it's no                                 individual who owns the trademark there                                 is an owner that's recognizable it's                                 registered so SP I saw for the public                                 interest is a public charity their                                 mission is to make sure it's for the                                 public good so they can't be bought out                                 really a similar one is Drupal so I look                                 cute little blue logo and Drupal who                                 owns this one okay we have a correct                                 answer immediately a dfdl or an                                 individual so Reese as an individual                                 owns the rights to this registered                                 trademark now the Drupal Foundation                                 which is a non-profit I believe runs the                                 project has governance does a great job                                 you can participate in                                 and have a seat of the table but at the                                 end of the day Greece can say this new                                 release is Drupal or not because if he                                 says it's not you can't use the                                 trademark so that's an important thing                                 to understand that he's behind the                                 project and it works well in that case                                 but you know I mean one question is                                 what's in rhesus will when he you know                                 something not that I hope whatever                                 happens but it's continuity that will be                                 questioned so a way to think about how                                 projects work and when a trademark                                 ownership is really important and when                                 it maybe it's not is doesn't you think                                 about three levels of open so it's not                                 just we say open source and that's                                 applies to too many things and of course                                 it's sometimes miss applied so I like a                                 structure where we have open source and                                 that's the actual definition is any                                 public code that is released under an                                 OSI approved license so the open source                                 initiative has a list of licenses that                                 they stamp they say it meets our                                 criteria and everybody I know who's you                                 know in the industry that's the list we                                 use that means an open source open                                 governance so is the project direction                                 is who can commit on to the code is how                                 is that done is there a documented                                 process is there a way that some new                                 individual or small company can come                                 along contribute and then get a seat if                                 they have valuable contribute                                 contributions that we kind of get you                                 know I'm there's Apache and Conservancy                                 and Linux Foundation they have the                                 governance part a lot of product of                                 commercial companies that say hey it's                                 open source                                 but it's not actually open governance I                                 just don't say that the third level                                 which a lot of people we don't have a                                 shared understanding of is is it an open                                 brand and that's the question of who                                 owns the trademark and I would posit                                 that to truly be an open brand the                                 trademark needs to be owned by a                                 non-profit public charity and the US                                 that's a                                                               sure cuz they're all a little bit                                 different but                                 it is a public charity like the purpose                                 of the organization is to serve the                                 public good in some way not to serve a                                 specific you know association of                                 companies whatever so understanding we                                 can fork source communities come and go                                 trademarks only have one owner so we'll                                 come back to my original point which is                                 I believe that open source projects most                                 important asset is its branch we have                                 great garden technology it's not an                                 asset it's free everyone can use it                                 or at least fork it we have a great                                 community but we're all individuals we                                 go different places we're not beholden                                 to our project we have one brand and                                 that is how the world comes to us and                                 sees us and that's the only thing that                                 we can can a project can control the use                                 of so when he misuses it we can go after                                 them somebody wants to fork we can stop                                 them from using our name so really                                 that's this is something I think that is                                 a bigger conversation in the whole                                 open-source world is we need to have                                 this more so we can either do a question                                 time or we can do some more quiz time                                 really quickly with last                                              have some burning questions or should I                                 go surprise you with some more open                                 source logos which ones they are both ok                                 well I have what we have one question                                 here it was a very eager CEO you're                                 recommending a nonprofit as the                                 appropriate holder of the trademark how                                 do you recommend we encourage our open                                 governance to control how the directors                                 or trustees or whatever legal                                 arrangement it is of that nonprofit make                                 their decisions or to whom they are                                 beholden when we make our questions                                 because there's no necessity that that                                 is related to governance in the examples                                 you gave where the governance foundation                                 is separate than the owner oh yeah so                                 how do we think about project governance                                 in terms of the code in the direction                                 and then ownership of the brand in                                 governance of that I mean the best way                                 is that sufficient of the technical                                 leaders                                 within the project who are doing the                                 work and effectively controlling                                 direction are also part of the                                 decision-making process for the brand I                                 mean they they need to be an overlap                                 right they need to have some kind of                                 combination so you can either do it                                 yourself and set up your own                                 organization or Conservancy the Apache                                 Linux Eclipse all have a model for you                                 and then will will exist as a home for                                 you which will handle those details but                                 there are you know there are there are                                 little bits of how those foundations do                                 governance that you need to make sure                                 you understand and you agree with or you                                 don't                                 so just really quickly who owns this                                 brand little talks the penguin of course                                 who owns the trademark behind it you                                 know well nobody really we can say an                                 individual Larry Ewing drew the original                                 talks so he owns copyright on this image                                 but there was a trademark registration                                 that was made for this specific image                                 but it's expired and nobody's done                                 anything with it and there's so many                                 tuxes now you couldn't trademark it                                 because you'd be coming in after the                                 fact so there is annotate mark here but                                 thanks Larry for drawing the the penguin                                 originally bones I have an open-source                                 project which covers can canvas in Linux                                 and we have some kind of Ken lines can                                 wire below the the penguin the question                                 is perhaps it's all on github for                                 example or other things and would it                                 make sense to make this also some kind                                 of brand or to market in some cases that                                 people just stick to this is a project                                 yeah yeah that that's a more complicated                                 question we have time for the one thing                                 I'll say is the the penguin is so widely                                 used that trying to make a new brand                                 that you're gonna really promote and                                 defend that incorporates the penguin                                 that's a risk because it's hard it would                                 be almost impossible to police use so                                 the interesting one is who owns this                                 word mark the word Linux so we have a                                 two pronged answer here legally leanness                                 Torvalds as an individual owns many I                                 have not looked them all up trademark                                 registrations on the word Linux now he                                 has chosen quite wisely to license them                                 all to the Linux mark Institute which                                 has worked with Linux Foundation to                                 handle all the details right which is                                 great but and I'm sure there are some                                 agreements that we don't see behind                                 there but legally he is an individual                                 control sis                                 I mean de facto it's the Linux                                 Foundation but there are subtleties that                                 that make a difference when you know if                                 there ever is a lawsuit anyway remember                                 this one here sendmail way back when you                                 might might remember this is actually                                 owned by a commercial company not that                                 it matters because it's not a big deal                                 now originally it was created by eric                                 allman                                 and who owns an individual but he his                                 company sold out to somebody else who                                 sold out to somebody else who actually                                 maintains a registration on sendmail                                 which by the way is a horrible name                                 because it's descriptive so it's me hard                                 to defend like we all send mail can I                                 send mail with my software of course I                                 can't have software that says send mail                                 but nitin so this one is actually in the                                 news we had a great talk earlier this                                 week about this one so who owns this                                 brand that's a trick question right now                                 Oracle owns this brand they are in the                                 process of incubating at the Apache                                 Software Foundation                                 so within well a few months it's lawyers                                 right so it'll be a while                                 within a few months Oracle will legally                                 transfer ownership of this registration                                 to the Apache Software Foundation                                 because their requirement at Apache is                                 that Apache owns the trademarks if you                                 give us a project we must have the                                 trademark so you if you hold back                                 anything that won't that work I just                                 have a couple more who owns this brand                                 well this is own cloud a local                                 commercial company that does your own                                 software they had some differences                                 within the company that owns this about                                 where their project should go well their                                 company essentially their company forked                                 and created some of the developers                                 including                                 the original leader created X cloud and                                 of course came up with a different logo                                 and brand and created their own thing                                 but again they had to fork the trademark                                 but I find that fascinating that the                                 commercial companies you know I guess as                                 politely as possible did that we'll just                                 do one more this is another very popular                                 one right so who owns Debian as a                                 trademark and here it's it is indeed a                                 non-profit public charity so Debian who                                 does all their own governance and is                                 lightweight they've decided to go to                                 software in the public interest to                                 ensure that their trademarks are                                 protected by somebody who has a legal                                 standing and who they can trust will not                                 interfere with them well let's do one                                 more this is kind of a tricky one jQuery                                 there's a tiny bit of a story so                                 originally jQuery was a at the software                                 freedom Conservancy which is a public                                 charity right so they had gotten a                                 project that became popular they're like                                 what we need to do something so they                                 went to Conservancy which is a great                                 place they did their own governance but                                 Conservancy handled the legal ownership                                 and could have defended the mark they                                 decided to change direction and ended up                                 moving to the Linux Foundation as a                                 collaborative project there so at this                                 point the Linux Foundation which is a                                 business trade association legally owns                                 the jQuery trademark so that's a                                 different little different meaning if                                 you pay to play on that particular                                 project at Linux Foundation you can have                                 a seat in governance which is different                                 than if you were at SPI and almost                                 exactly on time I am done and will put                                 up my beautiful kittens and say thank                                 you for attending and I don't think we                                 have time for questions here on the                                 video but I am happy to hang out                                 afterwards and of course you will                                 certainly be able to find me I hope                                 later on so thank you                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]                                 [Applause]                                 yeah many things strain the no more                                 questions I think we could have a few                                 minutes back certainly if anybody's                                 heading to lunch now                                 okay yeah so um you say that a brand is                                 our most valuable asset as a project and                                 I was wondering if you have any examples                                 that that prove that like things gone                                 horribly wrong people projects got                                 horribly burned by and getting you know                                 losing control um yeah I didn't I                                 enjoyed myself a little bit too much                                 last night to have the examples in the                                 tip of my tongue I mean one example of                                 not a fork but your your brand is                                 important is you know right we all                                 though that a couple years ago there's                                 an example where camera not a software                                 company but somebody wouldn't expect                                 applied for trademark registrations for                                 genome as a point-of-sale terminal so                                 genome is a Linux desktop so we look                                 here right so the one of the the things                                 that this company provided as how                                 they're going to use the genome name for                                 these point-of-sale terminals that at a                                 supermarket er or kiosk was a picture of                                 what looked like a computer desktop with                                 some icons so you know buy things and                                 add your terrific purchase up the genome                                 Foundation who doesn't really have you                                 know trademark lawyers at their disposal                                 who doesn't have the expertise said hey                                 you know this they realize it's gonna be                                 a problem which is good they complain to                                 the company the company essentially                                 stonewalled them you know that the                                 application is still waiting in the                                 national registry and eventually is                                 gonna go along the slow process and                                 become a registration and once you have                                 a registration is far far harder to                                 Kontest it so eventually you know had to                                 do a lot of work on their own had to                                 reach out to other foster organizations                                 to get some legal support and actually                                 had to go to the USPTO to file a formal                                 complaint in the process right while                                 they're trying to talk to company                                 at they also eventually said okay we                                 have to peril or they started a                                 fundraising campaign and doing what                                 press they could at that point the other                                 company presumably actually had somebody                                 who mattered come talk to them and                                 they're like hey we're just nonprofit                                 right they look the same same name you                                 can't do that and it wasn't until there                                 was a fundraising campaign and publicity                                 that the other company back down that's                                 kind of a flip side for I think you're                                 talking about but that's one thing                                 that's yes it the registration it issued                                 the other party could couldn't directly                                 have stopped a gnome from calling                                 themselves that but it certainly they                                 certainly could have caused a lot of                                 trouble so there's a whole world of                                 trademark registrations and the like                                 that open source projects often aren't                                 equipped to deal with and and we have                                 several cases that Apache where when                                 when new projects come to us we do a                                 sort of basic name search on what the                                 name they want to use is and that's                                 complicated because you know trademark                                 law there aren't hard answers and tape                                 are clogged or actually let me rephrase                                 that we're talking about trademark law                                 and conflicts so the conflict was no                                 more with the Patrick projects where                                 this conflict I have have one answer I                                 can answer all your questions about                                 trademark lot like that it depends but                                 no I just I just play a lawyer on the                                 internet I'm not actually a lawyer but                                 the complexity is there and you know                                 oftentimes we don't think about it                                 there's one case recently where at a                                 major foundation where some you know the                                 software company but not really in the                                 industries we're usually in came and                                 complained to this you know seven year                                 old recently well-known open source                                 project with their lawyer saying cease                                 and desist you may not use this it's a                                 simple name you may not use this word                                 for your project anymore because we have                                 a rigid registration for it and we're                                 like okay we've been happily coexisting                                 for seven years I didn't really know who                                 you were and that's one thing and the                                 other one is well what exactly does your                                 software do                                 well exactly this our software to would                                 it would it confuse someone to see you                                 know foo software would somebody know if                                 they got to the wrong page so one way to                                 think about confusion in trademarks is I                                 imagine you're searching for something                                 you kind of know what the product is and                                 you get the foo software page and it's                                 actually from you know somebody to know                                 the country building personal management                                 software instead of the business                                 software you what would you instantly                                 know you're on the wrong foo or what you                                 say hey this might be the fool I want                                 and I go download it                                 that would be confusion and the test for                                 doing that is complicated I think I                                 think part of the reason I'm having a                                 hard time getting to what I think you're                                 trying to ask about horror stories of                                 projects who had a problem is a lot of                                 these happen in private so a lot of                                 times it's there's you know either the                                 project wants to do something or                                 somebody contacts a project and says hey                                 you're infringing on my other name                                 privately and then they sort of wonder                                 within themselves what to do and it's                                 not usual you may not want to make a                                  public case until you understand what                                  the rules are so I think that's part of                                  it but that's a really good question hit                                  me up later - because I should go back                                  through notes and sort of that'd be a                                  good blog post of adding things okay do                                  we I'm happy to answer more questions or                                  hold more balloons there's some balloons

more                                  for the people on the video where should                                  they go to learn more for people who                                  can't come and
