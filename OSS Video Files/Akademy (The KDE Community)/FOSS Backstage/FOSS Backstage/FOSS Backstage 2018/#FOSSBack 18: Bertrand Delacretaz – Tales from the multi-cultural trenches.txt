Description: 
	They don't understand me! - tales from the multi-cultural trenches

Communicating in written form is hard anyway, and our Open Source circles add the additional hurdle of different cultural backgrounds and sensitivities.

Irony doesn't work. Jokes don't work. People get offended for no reason. They don't get what you're saying. Or they get it all wrong. Misunderstandings and conflicts are just around the corner, although we think we do our best to be efficient, fun and entertaining when talking to our project communities.

The problem is that our cultural backgrounds get in the way and shape the way we perceive many of the subtle nuances of human communication. Puzzled (or horrified) faces can help steer face-to-face conversations the right way, but we don't have this luxury in the asynchronous written communications which are the norm in Open Development.

Based on 17 years of experience in many projects of the Apache Software Foundation, our concrete examples of fun anecdotes, unnerving communication mishaps and nuclear-level conflicts (almost) will help us avoid common pitfalls and have happier and more efficient conversations in multi-cultural environments.

	                              thanks for being here it's a great                               pleasure to be on this stage again we                               know a few times and it's a great venue                               I like it so this talk is about how our                               culture influences the way we                               communicate in our open source projects                               we have people from lots of different                               cultures and I think that often gets in                               the way of how we communicate we                                understand each other or how we                                misunderstand each other so my name is                                Beth Lakota I'm from the french-speaking                                part of Switzerland I work for Adobe in                                Basel Switzerland German speaking part                                already is two slightly different                                cultures you'd be surprised                                I'm a principal scientist at Adobe so                                kind of an internal consultant doing                                architecture in the Java content                                management space I'm also on the board                                of directors of the Apache Software                                Foundation where I love listening to the                                accents on the board call we have an                                Australian guy we have Ross Gardner                                who's from the UK we have American                                people European people and that also                                tells something about the culture and I                                think it's a it's an asset so really                                having I think having this cultural                                diversity                                it's actually a great benefit for our                                communities because if you think                                slightly differently you will you will                                expose different things you will you                                know you will see problems that others                                might not see because in their culture                                it's not a problem and I think it's                                really an asset it's it's something that                                that we should try and take advantage of                                but for this on the other hand it makes                                communication harder and I have a few                                examples including some pretty dramatic                                ones where the culture and language and                                everything gets gets in the way and it's                                harder I enjoyed this morning's talk on                                empathy a lot but it did it was mostly                                about face-to-face communication and                                when you're talking on a mailing list or                                on on on a chat channel or whatever it's                                harder because                                Saro bandwidth channel you know it's                                riding it it's it's not as expressive as                                you know if I talk to you like that you                                will say okay disguise is a bit deep                                pressed so it might be be kind with him                                you know and if I'm here being the                                winner then maybe you're thinking this                                guy is being a bit arrogant it's not                                good in writing it's harder to make this                                kind of of you know expressions I'm                                wondering how many cultures we have in a                                room can you yell what's your culture                                I'm Swiss French yes Italy Deutsch                                India South Pacific I like that yes                                multicultural yes so we have many                                cultures and I do we have any soccer                                fans yes do we have any sailors                                musicians trumpet players no trumpet                                players drummers you're my friend I'm a                                drummer really you know culture is it's                                not just the country were you from there                                are many facets to the culture and if                                you talk with soccer fans I'm not a                                soccer fan but you might have some                                language or idioms you know in in the                                u.s. people they will often say you                                don't get past first base                                what do you mean what what's first base                                you know if you know the game is obvious                                if you don't know it you don't know so                                that culture is much more than just the                                country where you from or the the                                language that you speak the typical                                failure scenario when a disaster happens                                in our communities and but we'll see                                also in other places you have a bad                                decision initially that happens                                nobody's perfect we all make mistakes                                you make a mistake okay                                the problem is in the middle you have                                misunderstandings there's no course                                correction you know when you do a                                mistake you need to                                fix it and it means if you're steering a                                car or boat or motorcycle changing you                                your course if you don't understand each                                other                                this doesn't happen or it happens in the                                wrong direction and that's when                                 disasters happen this is a pretty small                                 disaster here on the right but it can                                 get much worse as as we'll see                                 I could have many examples from the                                 Apache Software Foundation and that that                                 was my initial idea I've been in DDS F                                 for                                                                  participated and initiated a number of                                 mistakes and we could talk about these                                 and some of them would be funny more                                 than than some others but we survived                                 and the SF survive but I find some                                 interesting examples from other fields                                 so it might be a bit surprised by my                                 examples but I think they they give a                                 different context to things so I am a                                 sailor I'm I'm happy to have my sailing                                 instructor in the room a manual he was                                 on stage before when he was also a great                                 sailor and a great instructor and when                                 you're sailing the first thing you                                 should do is plot your course you know                                 decide how you which direction you're                                 going to stay to sail in order to stay                                 safe and this is an example you have an                                 island and you want to sail past it                                 pretty close to it because you want to                                 see the scenery or show you both to                                 whoever's on the island so you you plot                                 your course with the red arrows and okay                                 so you decide okay we'll do this bearing                                 and then that at this point here it will                                 change the bearing and go to another                                 direction and then there's wind                                          of wind the black arrow here is north                                 east the wind is pushing you towards the                                 shore so you have to be careful don't                                 you know don't mess up and then if you                                 zoom it so this is a pretty rough map                                 chart and then if you zoom in you start                                 seeing that there's actually some                                 serious rocks near this show and if you                                 zoom in even more on the right the                                 yellow path this is this is a ground                                 that you don't want to hit with your                                 boat the small crosses that's rocks you                                 don't want to eat them                                 so you're going to say                                 in this direction and then the wind will                                 be pushing you towards the shore and                                 it's kind of dangerous so I'm not sure                                 if it was a good idea whoever did this                                 chart                                 they might mind not having a fantastic                                 idea but you have crew right you're not                                 alone on your boat if it's a big boat                                 you have several people so you kind of                                 counting on them to say help you cause                                 correction hey captain you know if I'm                                 the first mate with the manual as                                 captain I would say manual captain I                                 think that's a bit dangerous should we                                 really do that or how do we stay safe                                 even with this slightly hairy course and                                 if you don't communicate well that's                                 when disasters happen and this is                                 actually it's it's not it's not a fun                                 thing it's it's dramatic accident had                                 happened you probably heard of the Costa                                 Concordia and I've been reading the the                                 accident reports and it's pretty it's                                 interesting in a sad way because the                                 it's really you know you could say okay                                 that the captain did a big mistake to                                 decide to sail so close to the to the                                 coast but then he was not alone on this                                 boat and that you know there's first                                 made there's people who have some                                 authority to challenge the captain's                                 decisions or at least say something and                                 you know it was a bit hard on that boat                                 because on that ship I should say                                    different nationalities on the boat so                                 we need to find a common language to                                 communicate despite all the different                                 cultures and everything and the the                                 company decided that the working                                 language was Italian because the boat is                                 Italian the boats papers are Italian so                                 let's speak Italian why not I'm not sure                                 if it's a you know I love Italians it                                 sounds great and I love Italian people                                 and Italy but it's not the most common                                 language yeah it's not the language well                                 you have the most you know chance of                                 finding people who understand it                                 properly and even then the the first                                 engineer testified that he did not fully                                 understand the orders given in the                                 Italian language you know first engineer                                 it's someone important you should make                                 sure that the communication gets true                                 and then the health the helmsman the guy                                 who's actually steering the boat                                 testified that at times he did not                                 understand the Masters orders where when                                 given in English so you have a serious                                 communications problem                                 and that's when when disasters happen                                 and you have examples here and bad                                 decisions like you know going                                          so close to the coast it's pretty                                 dangerous but it I think that this could                                 still be avoided                                 if someone will you know a few people                                 said captain this is not going well we                                 need to do something else we need to                                 communicate properly and change course                                 in order to avoid the disaster did not                                 happen unfortunately so I think it                                 really demonstrates this this this you                                 know sequence a bad decision I think the                                 and the chart that I was showing is                                 actual chart that they recovered from                                 from the ship which is not a very                                 detailed chart you know they should have                                 used first a much more detailed chart                                 and and and plotted they should have                                 floated a more a much safer course it                                 was dangerous to start with but then the                                 real problem is that there was no course                                 correction nobody fixed the thing and                                 then you get big disasters and a very                                 sad one in this case luckily usually for                                 us the stakes are not that high but                                 still if you know if you do a bad job                                 there are probably as some                                 life-preserving devices that run on                                 apache software or software from                                 whatever committee you're in so it's                                 still serious stuff and then you know                                 the story of the Tower of Babel all the                                 all the different languages it would be                                 interesting to count how many languages                                 we have in the room we'll probably have                                 maybe                                                                 and even the language is not everything                                 there's all the subtle cultural things                                 that you know don't get through because                                 different idioms if I tell you this                                 there is a zebra crossing around the                                 corner for some people a zebra crossing                                 is you know something that you use to                                 cross the street as a pedestrian and                                 others will figure zebra the animals                                 crossing a river                                 and and this is this in Berlin be around                                 the corner it sounds really funny funny                                 guy you know and when you meet people                                 how do you how do you cheer you know in                                 in Switzerland if I meet friends that                                 are know well I would kiss them on the                                 cheek three times in France it's four or                                 sometimes two it's two it depends on the                                 region and then my people my kids around                                                                                                       you meet them they will do that they                                 will kiss you on the cheeks even if you                                 don't know the person and for me you                                 know it's usually because I know the                                 person well all these small things                                 cultural things I was lucky to travel to                                 Australia to an Aboriginal preserve to                                 go fishing and we are supposed to get a                                 guide so you go there and you meet the                                 people and you shake hands and you look                                 them in the eye and then someone said                                 you know if you shake hands to these                                 people it might means you want to fight                                 and if you look them in the eye it's                                 it's you're trying to show that you're                                 stronger than them it it's not something                                 you want to do you know and in my                                 country if I don't shake hands and only                                 look people in the eye it's in price so                                 you know subtle or not so subtle                                 cultural things the gestures you know                                 the this divers okay in some countries                                 means something very bad so have to be                                 careful with that how do you cheer when                                 you drink here at the conference we're                                 going to have beers later you know how                                 do you                                 it's very cultural and you can you can                                 come across as rude because you don't do                                 things in the way the people expect the                                 there's a rubber in the UK this thing                                 here the eraser is called a rubber in                                 other countries it means something very                                 different and you know and call McCarty                                 and guy from Apache wrote that on                                 Twitter was it a good funeral when you                                 went to a funeral in Ireland it's                                 something you are expected to ask was it                                 a good funeral in some countries what do                                 you mean good funeral are there any good                                 funerals so it's all very solid things                                 which can be awkward when you're meeting                                 people in person but                                 think they also influence the way we                                 communicate in in writing on our on our                                 mailing lists or or whatever the jokes                                 are also very cultural this is you know                                 this is a joke from my country and then                                 when you when you tell the jokes you you                                 might get faces like that someone filed                                 finds it extremely funny and the other                                 person is offended because in their                                 culture is not something you're supposed                                 to joke about and sometimes if what you                                 say is that even a joke you know what's                                 the difference between the dark                                 usually the first question you get is a                                 dark on what No what's the difference                                 between a dark actually the difference                                 is that both the legs are of the same                                 length especially the left one you know                                 some people will find it funny some                                 people will find it completely stupid                                 some people will even wonder if it's a                                 joke you know it's difficult and and                                 that's the kind of things that that                                 usually can go bad between cultures and                                 you look stupid or you offend people                                 without I hope this will not often                                 anyone it's not very very risky one but                                 there are some risky jokes and you have                                 to be very careful about that                                 another cultural thing is how you                                 express your appreciation or not in my                                 country in my region if I say it's okay                                 that's very positive you know if I see                                 something is pretty okay I'm being very                                 enthusiastic about it whereas some other                                 countries will say it's amazing it's                                 great it's fantastic what you did here                                 better I like you I love you I've loved                                 you forever and you know it's very clear                                 appreciation or as if I tell you it's                                 pretty okay you know it's not                                 fantastically expressive appreciation so                                 here we have someone else on Twitter                                 saying you know the opposite when                                 something is wrong you can say this is                                 wrong or you can say I'm sorry but isn't                                 there a small problem here with this                                 thing and it in the end it means the                                 same thing but you would do it's telling                                 it differently I have a work colleague                                 that tends to very often say this is                                 wrong                                 and it makes me feel uncomfortable I                                 don't like that you know I like to have                                 at least be given an option how to fix                                 it or something a bit subtle but it's                                 it's not there's there are no bad                                 intentions he means right he means to                                 fix the problem but in a way that                                 doesn't go well with my my cultural                                 background this is typical to French and                                 not all languages I don't know a few                                 languages have this the - and vous you                                 know and in English it's you but even in                                 English there's some polite form you                                 know if I say miss crowns or I say Merle                                 that that's one of them is kind of more                                 polite than the other and then how do                                 you decide this is a flowchart for                                 deciding in French it's kind of on the                                 funny side but it's not that wrong you                                 know if if your kid talking to an adult                                 you'll save you and if an adult is                                 talking to a kid they'll say - which is                                 a familiar form and if you know and then                                 you meet someone having beers and you                                 say - and then you figure out this                                 person is the president of your country                                 and then you meet them in a different                                 setting and you say vous the polite form                                 it's very subtle and and it can also go                                 wrong when you change countries I'm sure                                 between France and Canada for example                                 both speak French but I'm sure that the                                 use is quite different when you say -                                 and when you say vous polite form so                                 this is also something that that can                                 that can throw you off and even as I say                                 in English there are some polite forms                                 even there's just you when you speak                                 directly to people you can make a face                                 you know if if I look at who you like                                 this you can imagine that I'm not being                                 totally happy and and when you speak                                 directly to people you can get this                                 feedback much quicker by by making a                                 face showing that you don't understand                                 or you disagree or you you kind of                                 thrown off it's very easy in writing                                 it's much harder you know it's it's you                                 have to be much more explicit saying I                                 am uncomfortable with this or I don't                                 understand what you're saying maybe                                 because of my culture you know you have                                 to be more it's                                 sometimes it sounds a bit complicated                                 but but you have to do that so so you                                 don't have the luxury of making a face                                 to express what what you what you have                                 so it's really complicated the you know                                 due to the fact that we're communicating                                 and writing as synchronously it makes                                 the whole thing much more complicated                                 and culture so in the beginning you know                                 when I was asking about culture most                                 people will say they where they come                                 from which country or which language and                                 here we have an example where I think so                                 you probably know about this another                                 this another sad disaster it's not funny                                 at all but it's interesting to study how                                 these things happen and try to find out                                 how you can avoid them next time this is                                 a challenger space shuttle from                                      which exploded after a few seconds of                                 flight and the thing is that when they                                 launched it they already had launched a                                 number of shuttles you see in the                                 diagram in the middle it's from Edward                                 Tufte z-- Edward Tufte is a professor                                 who who's been writing a few fantastic                                 books on how you visualize information                                 and the diagram in the middle is tough                                 this diagram to show the problem the                                 dots the black dots that you have under                                 mostly on the right there are the                                 successful launches and the higher the                                 more problems they had with the orange a                                 type of joint you know seals that that                                 had problems in the in the Challenger                                 shuttle so we kind of see a curve like                                 that and it gets worse as the                                 temperature gets lower and the the green                                 ellipses here is where the this                                 problematic launch was so it was much                                 colder than the the other launches there                                 were there was ice on the ice pad it was                                 minus freezing point during the night                                 and for many engineers it was obvious                                 that it was very risky to launch the                                 show because these o-rings were not                                 designed for such cold temperatures and                                 it they were not exactly sure what might                                 happen and then the worst happened                                 the problem is that part of the problem                                 is that the engineers were not able to                                 communicate the problem in a suitable                                 way to the to the managers who were                                 making the decisions so here you have in                                 engineering versus managers culture and                                 those are slightly different cultures                                 you know as engineers if I put this a                                 bit you know in a very schematic form as                                 an engineer I want to do a fantastic                                 engineering job I want my software to be                                 perfect to have no bugs to be nice to be                                 you know cute to read or any anything                                 you can imagine as a manager I want to                                 sell the you know I want to sell                                 the product and make money so that I can                                 pay the engineers so they can feed their                                 families and have a house and live it's                                 kind of you know it might be opposing                                 constraints and and then it influences                                 your culture in a way and so what I'm                                 saying here is that the culture can be                                 much more than just where you come from                                 or what language to speak in the the box                                 here John primary concern that you could                                 probably can't really read it was it's a                                 typical engineering report they're                                 they're listing items you know                                 temperature is low the joint the o-rings                                 might have problems and the thing might                                 explode but it's just bullet points you                                 know whereas if someone would have come                                 up with such a diagram like in the                                 middle it might be much more obvious for                                 the manager to see it doesn't make sense                                 to launch this this thing                                 let's not launch it so the culture can                                 hide in in unexpected places so this                                 doesn't make our job better it's very                                 complicated and and then we have to find                                 ways to fix it and avoid these problems                                 so how we can avoid them is by acting in                                 this middle element of my diagram the                                 bad decisions as I as I think it's                                 obviously bad decisions they happen                                 everybody makes mistakes and in a group                                 it you know and then initial bad                                 decision can happen what we can                                 influence is can we discuss more                                 efficiently have better communications                                 so that we can cause correct and avoid                                 the disasters                                 so let's try to see how we can fix this                                 in the end it's yet it's just about the                                 communications an interesting example                                 from also a slightly different field I                                 recently found out that the the aviation                                 airline industry they have defined and                                 standardized a simplified English                                 language for the technical manuals for                                 for airplanes and you know everything                                 that goes around aviation and it's a                                 great way to make it easier because part                                 of the problem is also that for most of                                 us English is our second or third or                                 fourth language and it's not all native                                 language so we might and master all the                                 subtleties of English so and it's the                                 same thing in their aviation manuals                                 because you have people doing aviation                                 maintenance from very different                                 countries and modeling model tanks so                                 they have defined this ASD is ASD ste                                                                                                    version of English with only I think                                 only like a thousand words and it has                                 lots of examples of how you should                                 phrase things so to make them                                 understandable here we have an example                                 from the robot world Hobart virtual                                 website for example instead of saying                                 all valves must be turned slowly you say                                 turn all bar slowly you know active                                 voice present tense very simple phrases                                 shorter phrases as well remove                                 everything that's not too absolutely                                 required make it concise make it simple                                 and I think that's a great thing that we                                 can do in on in our communications on                                 our mailing lists on on or description                                 channels to stick to simple language we                                 have some people I know some some in                                 Apache who are fantastic riders and the                                 right very nice phrase is very sometimes                                 exotic and a bit complicated i express                                 things in a subtle way it's not very                                 good for the others you know you know                                 then I'm not only native English speaker                                 and even after                                                        Software Foundation I have to look                                 upward sometimes even in the in the                                 board meetings on the board calls we                                 have a back                                 channel on the IRC on chat and sometimes                                 I ask what does the person mean with                                 this idiom with this expression because                                 I don't know it so bye-bye you know                                 sticking to a simple language making                                 your communication simpler you can help                                 get your message across to avoid                                 misunderstandings this is you know this                                 is communications                                                      it's it's simple principles that we                                 should we should use when communicating                                 assume good intentions know when you get                                 an email and ok you think people are                                 being rude or they're they're                                 considering you as an idiot or you know                                 not taking your your value added into                                 account or whatever figure figure out                                 this this care be here this care care                                 bear here that's the difficult one you                                 know imagine people usually people want                                 to be nice and even if they don't you                                 should assume they will they want you                                 know if you react immediately with a                                 nasty email and and things can escalate                                 very quickly so it's always a good idea                                 to assume good intentions how you know                                 what is the person really trying to do                                 or even if they're being a bit nasty                                 usually it's for the sake of the project                                 hopefully you know you can try to find                                 something positive this was also                                 something that was said in this                                 morning's empathy talk where they have                                 this retrospectives where everyone has                                 to say something positive about someone                                 else it's a good thing to do and and I                                 think we should try to do that to avoid                                 escalating things and then ask for                                 clarification very often the message is                                 not as you understood it or even the                                 person has a message in their mind and                                 what they wrote is not exactly that                                 they're you know there's some shift and                                 then it turns you to something nasty                                 even though at the beginning it was you                                 know supposed to be to be it was good                                 and with good intentions so you should                                 always do that reformulate you know I'm                                 always trying to do that when we have                                 difficult discussion even in one of our                                 projects                                 I always reformulate what I understood                                 you know if                                 I understand correctly you are saying                                 that such and such and then it's a good                                 check and then if someone is really some                                 saying something nasty                                 you can reformulate it in you know but                                 keeping the nastiness you know if I                                 understand correctly you are saying that                                 I'm not capable of doing that job if you                                 think that's what the people are saying                                 it's fine reformulate it like that                                 without being aggressive but expressing                                 what you want you you understood and                                 then you will go to recycles a few times                                 and hopefully get to the to the right                                 message the problem can be sometimes our                                 ego you know I don't want to look weak                                 or one want to look too much like a Care                                 Bear it's you know it's not my style so                                 so you have to be careful and sometimes                                 just show your eye go out of the window                                 and and just try to be nice for the sake                                 of the project I was telling about I                                 come in Apache one of the first                                 communities where I was involved with                                 cocoon and cocoon was a fantastic                                 community because it was mostly small                                 companies or independents and we all had                                 a business based on cocoon so when we                                 disagreed we didn't say okay I'm out of                                 here by now I need to stay in this                                 project because it's my business so we                                 found ways to fix it and we talked and                                 discussed and clarified until we found                                 some agreement and I think that that's a                                 good example depending on your stakes in                                 a project you're not just going to walk                                 out you you will fix things and that                                 that's great another thing that can help                                 is graphics when you have to explain                                 something complicated it's much better                                 to do drawing a diagram or whatever you                                 know here typically this is also                                 something cultural in in Switzerland we                                 have four official languages so all all                                 our road signs are you know pictograms                                 they are graphic because you if we                                 needed to write something like dangerous                                 turn we would have to write this in four                                 languages doesn't work so you do it you                                 do a nice pictogram I think I like the I                                 like the graphic on the right it it's                                 very clear be careful with all people                                 you know that I think bow                                 hopefully all cultures would recognize                                 it like that                                 so graphics can help if you have to                                 express something complex another thing                                 is we are lucky we are writing on code                                 so if you have to explain something I                                 don't like the the long technical                                 discussions you know we write an email                                 with twenty five paragraphs explaining                                 what you want to do do it you know do a                                 prototype and show it to to the to the                                 others even if it's ugly                                 unfinished not stable whatever it's                                 often much more expressive than                                 explaining it you know if you can show                                 some code or even some code excerpts and                                 that's a luxury that we have even though                                 the write written form is harder we know                                 how to code and often we know how to                                 express ourselves Prima pretty well with                                 code so that's that's something that can                                 also help us get clear communications if                                 you do fantastic jokes like the dark one                                 be explicit about them you know say okay                                 in the extreme you say now I am going to                                 tell you a joke and it's a joke from my                                 culture so maybe you will not like it                                 but I like to tell you this joke and you                                 know in an email you can tweet a joke                                 marker or irony or sarcasm or whatever                                 it feels a bit strange sometimes you                                 know because if if you have to mark up                                 your irony it's it's the effect is a                                 kind of a bit lost but it's much safer                                 so you have to be careful or maybe you                                 can avoid it completely I'm not I'm not                                 a big fan of political correctness                                 it can be very boring so I like you know                                 I like to make some jokes and try to                                 have some some entertaining stuff in our                                 communications but you have to be                                 careful and Mark things clearly so                                 people know are you being serious or not                                 and very often you see that on a mailing                                 list                                 you know sometimes someone writes a                                 sentence another person replies kind of                                 somewhat angry and the other says yeah                                 but I was joking so you know if you're                                 joking put at least smiley or something                                 that that helps people find out I have a                                 few example of                                 you know how to phrase things so so you                                 leave it open and and you try to bring                                 the temperature down and calm things                                 down the left one is one that I wrote on                                 an internal mailing list at work                                 recently I'm freaking out when I see                                 comments that apply that we might be                                 married to such proprietary services and                                 then I added I'm freaking out in a                                 friendly way with a smiley you know to                                 say I'm not angry freaking out is just a                                 way to express that this makes me an                                 uncomfortable try to you know maybe make                                 a joke about yourself it's not dangerous                                 for the others or you know try to as I                                 say on the right focus like a warrior                                 you want to get to your destination but                                 friendly like a Care Bear Express things                                 in as in a very friendly way as possible                                 reformulating I'm not sure what you mean                                 by substandard do you mean I'm totally                                 incapable of doing that or it just you                                 don't like the way I wrote the code find                                 out ask for for confirmation then the                                 last one is when when someone you know                                 when someone will call you code a piece                                 of I would reply you could reply                                 with calling people names you know but                                 it's much better to say what you said                                 makes me uncomfortable it's about me so                                 how can we fix it and how can we fix it                                 for the sake of the project try to you                                 know leave options open for whoever                                 wrote what you consider a nasty message                                 and and you know make sure you go                                 forward for the sake of your project and                                 you know again recommendations about                                 communications                                     I think being direct helps don't take                                 too many detours if you're unhappy about                                 something it's fine to say it if you say                                 I am unhappy that's a fact                                 nobody can hate you for saying that you                                 have the right to be unhappy and it                                 doesn't you know call other people names                                 or whatever because in the end you                                 really want that course correction to                                 happen if you're on the project you want                                 to project project to succeed and there                                 will be bad decisions so you need to you                                 know contribute to fixing them                                 so here's my coda this is my musicians                                 culture showing up you know I call my                                 conclusions coda if you don't know what                                 a coda is in a music piece it's a piece                                 that comes at the end okay so really                                 again I think if you can remember just                                 one thing from from this talk it's I                                 think this diagram bad decision followed                                 by miscommunications leads to disaster                                 and we can improve that by improving the                                 communications to make sure the course                                 correction happens ain't not going to                                 hit the Giglio island with your ship so                                 it requires good communications and I                                 think to help the communications be                                 better it's our job to verify that there                                 are no misunderstandings and no hidden                                 cultural obstacles you know all these                                 subtle cultural things that we discussed                                 they get in the way of our communication                                 so it's fine to check and double-check                                 and ask for clarification make sure you                                 have understood and then this can help                                 us have more efficient communications                                 hopefully thank you for your attention                                 this was the first time I did this talk                                 so I hope it's been useful and open to                                 feedback to improve it for next time                                 thank you and we have four minutes and                                                                                                        you for your talk I identified a problem                                 especially in open source seen in East                                 Asia I mean for us mainland or European                                 we're struggling enough with learning                                 English and for East Asian it's much                                 more difficult to learn English and I                                 think that's holding a lot of people off                                 to get involved into open source                                 communities it's only when they are                                 joining big companies then they have to                                 learn English                                 to some degree and I think there's so                                 much potential in that area which we                                 cannot use I but I don't have a obvious                                 solution yeah yeah it's it's a                                 difficulty that we see in so I'm very                                 active in in Apache we have some                                 projects now where there's lots of                                 people at least nothing from China and                                 and it's its difficulty and of course                                 people are much more comfortable                                 speaking their own language from the                                 point of view of the foundation we have                                 to have oversight of what happens in our                                 projects and I don't think we are                                 resources at this point to do that with                                 non-english projects I'm hoping that                                 this happens at some point but then we                                 need to have a clear structure of you                                 know translation and reporting I totally                                 agree that that's that's a problem and                                 I'm not sure the way we can fix it is                                 that if you speak those languages or                                 anyone who speaks those languages should                                 get involved and help make that happen                                 and we have some people in Apache who                                 are starting to do that but I would say                                 it's really been beginnings of that                                 thank you thank you for a great talk I                                 wish I listen to this this morning                                 before I respond on an email so my                                 question is how do you deal with                                 cultures that are you know inherently                                 closed like you mentioned East Asia yeah                                 they're inherently closed for whatever                                 reasons they're comfortable to talk in                                 their own language or they don't like to                                 share how do you deal with when you're                                 working with such people and in a                                 constructive way how do you have                                 feedback and make all of us involved                                 yeah I think so I'm working adobe has I                                 think                                                                   over the globe                                 and we have some cultures where it's                                 very hierarchical I'm not supposed to                                 talk directly to the engineer I have to                                 talk to the manager and that that makes                                 that's part of this kind of                                 complications I think also as was said                                 in this                                 morning's talk finding allies is a key                                 finding the few people who who will get                                 in with your way of doing things and                                 then encouraging them to come up and do                                 it and be examples for others that                                 that's one way that I can see now it's                                 you cannot impose things on people I                                 think what works best is I will change                                 my ways if I see an example from someone                                 whom I trust and I will tend to trust                                 more people from my saying the same                                 culture you know I trust Emmanuel                                 because it is a sailor                                 he's a french-speaking guy he's a friend                                 so you tend to trust it's always I think                                 we have an inherent in our brains we                                 have this wiring of us versus the others                                 and it's always difficult to find out                                 who's the other and if I consider                                 someone the other I will tend to trust                                 them less so I think if you can you have                                 this group of people who are not on                                 board with your things but you have one                                 or two people who might be getting in                                 try to identify those and work with them                                 or encourage them to come up so that                                 they can be examples for the others it's                                 it's one small thing I'll agree that                                 that the problem is larger than that                                 so I have two questions the first one                                 when say hits a rock they're probably                                 cool to go squad say telling that they                                 were thinking what did the core squat                                 answered sorry I have a hard time                                 hearing you yeah you know it was Troop                                 stupid joke anyway I guess everyone                                 knows about you know we are thinking                                 yeah thinking yeah the accents get in                                 the way that's what if you say we are                                 thinking and the others response what                                 are you thinking about that can be a                                 problem                                 so my real question was about something                                 different we owe some refugee I don't                                 know how to tell in English a                                 preconception preconception of other                                 people from other country like French we                                 think that German are very strict and so                                 on how do you deal with those kind of                                 preconceptions right I think I think we                                 should just forget about so I'm sorry I                                 you know I showed the thing about the                                 German saying this is wrong the the                                 British saying I'm sorry could there be                                 a problem here and the Americans saying                                 this is amazing but maybe there's a                                 small problem with that this was not my                                 text it was just quoting someone from                                 from Twitter I think though that those                                 are very can be very nasty and and when                                 I wanna hear people saying oh the                                 journals are like that or the Americans                                 are like that I know maybe some maybe a                                 majority of them can be like that but                                 don't generalize you know it's people                                 have some trade character traits that                                 you it's good to it I identify them but                                 I think we should be very careful about                                 not generalizing they are all definitely                                 some cultural biases which influence our                                 communications but they can be you know                                 I'm sure there are some some Germans                                 that would react like the American in in                                 the the example that showed or it we                                 have to be very and it's also a form of                                 racism you know to say because you                                 because you know allows your your form                                 German origins I would say last I'm sure                                 you're like that because you're you're                                 born Germany this is totally wrong                                 exactly oh okay so I'm falling in my                                 face here but it would be totally wrong                                 all right Manuel                                 you live in Paris so the Paris people                                 they're always you know busy or whatever                                 it's really wrong you have to judge the                                 people you know or identified the style                                 by what do people actually do and and I                                 would I think we should avoid these they                                 are fun in jokes but not I don't don't                                 thing more than that I don't think it's                                 useful but um Maceo what is the path                                 thank you for your presentation and we                                 will meet here and ten minutes
