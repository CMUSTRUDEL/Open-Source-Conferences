	                              hello everybody we've got a fairly small                               audience so I will notice if you're not                               paying attention                               my name is Merle this is Dustin                               McLean we're going to talk today about                               the Apache Software incubator so first                               off a little bit about our backgrounds I                               am an individual contributor for Apache                               finish for also for the the Apache                                community and I'm also the PMC chair of                                Apache for interact which is a recently                                graduated project we graduated in April                                of last year I've had nearly                                            software development experience and                                mostly in the areas around API                                development and rest development and                                this is Justin Justin hi everyone I'm                                Justin my voice is a little bit croaky                                but I think it's going to last this talk                                I mentioned up there is I'm a bit of a                                released enthusiast I went through the                                incubator list the other day and counted                                out how many releases I had voted on and                                the answer was                                                      little bit about that later                                I'm also VP of Apache minut which is a                                real-time operating system and very                                recently the VP chair of the incubator                                itself so everyone here is obviously                                aware of the Apache photos Software                                Foundation yes good okay so the Apache                                Software Foundation makes software open                                source software for the public good                                there they're actually the corporate                                structure is even set up that way so                                there are charity and the Apache                                Incubator is just one of the many                                projects that is part of Apache and it                                is where projects come to learn how to                                become an Apache project and                                more importantly is how they can grow                                and build their communities so in this                                presentation we're going to cover the                                incubation process itself                                Merle's going to talk about global                                poverty and and how to solve that very                                hard problem and also go through her                                experience for with the going through                                the incubation project and finally we're                                going to talk about you know how do you                                succeed in becoming a successful project                                open source project um now we're not                                lawyers we mention a few legal issues                                here if you need legal advice please go                                ask a real lawyer here be dragons so                                what does the Apache Incubator it's                                basically the entry point where all                                Apache not all but most of hatchery                                projects come into and they sent spent                                some time in the incubator usually                                between a year or two learning about                                Apache and the Apache way hopefully                                growing their community and then                                becoming a top level project so why                                would you want to bring your project to                                Apache and the in the first plots you                                need to there's certain things that your                                project has to follow in in order to do                                that and to become an Apache project                                being open and transparent is is                                probably the most important one                                everything that goes on in a project                                needs to be discussed in the open on on                                the mailing list also Apache is very                                strong on individuals and not companies                                companies cannot buy a seat on either                                the project management committee or on                                the board and Apache and everyone who                                acts at Apache is acting as an                                individual not the company they work for                                and you have to make that distinction                                very very clear and they take some                                projects or quite a long                                to sort of get used to that and so it                                can be quite tricky                                um there's no been vanilla the dictators                                for life there's no one everyone is                                equal on the project some people may                                have slightly more responsibilities if                                you're a committer you have a slightly                                more responsibility than the user and if                                you're part of the PMC then you have                                slightly more responsibility again but                                everyone's voice is it is basically                                equal and everyone can discuss and                                comment on if a user votes on a release                                that vote is and actually binding but                                you know people will still listen to it                                particularly if a lot of people say oh                                 now we've got something really wrong                                 here we need to we need to fix this up                                 so why do we actually go through an                                 incubating process and the first thing                                 that you need to do is basically we want                                 to give Apache that is want to give                                 people the basically totally lost words                                 what they want to give people the                                 security I guess that anyone can take                                 some Apache software and use it and no                                 there's no legal issues there that's                                 what I was trying to say so that it all                                 all the licensing has been checked all                                 the IP of every single line of code is                                 documented and knows where it comes from                                 so anyone can take that and use that                                 under the terms of the Apache License                                 and make their business out of it um                                 they also want to go through the                                 incubating process to as I said learn                                 the Apache way and also to learn about                                 ASF policy and there's policies there's                                 a huge number of policies there's some                                 legal policy there's some branding                                 policy and there's some release policy                                 and that's basically it                                 all right projects themselves are giving                                 are given a lot of freedom in how they                                 operate and what they can do but as they                                 do have these policies and guidelines                                 then they need to follow in order to                                 become an Apache project                                 so what is the Apache Way well it's it's                                 a sort of a hard thing to qualify it's                                 um it's a bit like Zen it's is sort of                                 once you know it you know it but if you                                 don't know it it's hard to explain to                                 someone else but there are some cool                                 things behind there about it and that                                 includes collaboration community                                 consensus and being open the yeah I                                 don't think I'm gonna go any more into                                 it into that the apache license itself                                 allows anyone to take software that has                                 the apache license and use it for just                                 about any purpose they want there are no                                 restrictions of use and they can use it                                 for commercial purposes if they want                                 they can we would like that they get                                 involved in the project and you know                                 maybe contribute to it either help out                                 as users or raise some bugs or hopefully                                 commit some code but that's not a                                 requirement and we find that a lot of                                 people do give back and some don't but                                 that's fun that's fine also we end up                                 with enough people that can help grow                                 the project and and the community around                                 the project that way the it's obviously                                 an open-source license and it's one of                                 the more permissive license there's a                                 few other licenses that are also                                 permissive MIT and BSD for example are                                 very similar in in in those terms                                 and and as I was saying before it means                                 that there are no legal issues that                                 you're gonna have if you have something                                 that comes from the ISF and it has an                                 apache license on it you're pretty sure                                 that no one is will try and take you to                                 court to say you know you're using our                                 code or anything along those lines so                                 the incubator currently has                                             in incubation it they generally stay in                                 incubation between one and two years                                 summer some are shorter summer long some                                 never leave the incubator at all I think                                 we've got I think the current record is                                 five or six years and there's about all                                 these pod links                                 as they're learning the process they                                 make releases and there's been about                                 around ten releases a month come out of                                 out of the incubator there so what do                                 you have to go through to actually get                                 into the incubator first off you need to                                 find someone who has done this before                                 and can guide you through the process                                 and they are your champion and they will                                 help you draft up a proposal and which                                 you'll then send to the incubator                                 mailing list for discussion just about                                 every single proposal that gets to that                                 stage will get accepted as an incubating                                 project there are there are there's a                                 few cases where that hasn't happened and                                 quite often there'll be a lot of                                 discussion beforehand before it gets                                 sent to the list and that they may just                                 decide that no the ASF is not a good fit                                 for us because of whatever reason so                                 once you've got your proposal you need                                 at least three Mentors and these are                                 people who have experience at Apache and                                 they're part of the incubator and they                                 can be their job is to help you through                                 the incubation process from start to                                 finish and that's hopefully what you end                                 up graduating and becoming a top-level                                 project from there so then there's a                                 discussion about the proposal and then                                 it will generally be bit put for a vote                                 and the incubator PMC will vote on it                                 and as I said it's very very rare that a                                 project does not get accepted if it's                                 got to that stage once it's been                                 accepted the puddling then gets                                 bootstrapped and that means setting up                                 servers setting up mailing lists setting                                 up version control setting up juror you                                 know all that sort of infrastructure you                                 need to be able to run the proof run the                                 project apache hosts all of that for the                                 project there's no charge to the project                                 and in that regards and occasionally                                 projects can ask for a few you know                                 different things not all projects so                                 that they're the same and some times                                 requirements are                                 little different you need to check that                                 all of the initial committees that are                                 on the project have signed a contributor                                 agreement I CLA and that means that they                                 say I'm legally allowed to give you this                                 code and it there's no there's no IP                                 issues with it and that if it generates                                 you know code you've written yourself so                                 you say you're giving up your IP rights                                 to that code um if the code if there's                                 there's usually projects that come to                                 the incubator will already have a                                 community around them and they'll have a                                 large code base that that software needs                                 to come in via software grant and again                                 that's just the the same sort of thing                                 it's it's saying like here's this all                                 this code that we're doing donating the                                 ASF now owns the IP of this code so then                                 the process is you need to look through                                 all the code and double check that                                 everything is is all correct and quite                                 often it's not quite often there will be                                 you know someone's copied some code from                                 somewhere or you know I know in my case                                 I did minus one on a on a release                                 because they had a picture of a cat in                                 it so which was actually done by a                                 professional photographer and he owned                                 the copyright to the to the picture so                                 you have to go through and check that                                 everything is is correct as far as IP                                 goes and then you can start making                                 releases and hopefully once you start                                 making releases and you get the word out                                 there and you talk about your projects                                 at conferences like this your community                                 grows you attract more people those some                                 of your users may become committers                                 themselves and that sort of keeps going                                 and going and going so in order to grow                                 your community though you have to follow                                 the principles behind the apache way and                                 that is making sure that you keep all                                 the discussion on the mailing list that                                 you are open and transparent about                                 everything and that you make sure that                                 people are                                 acting at the best interests of the                                 project and not being you know a puppet                                 for a corporation and most of all one of                                 the things that we it's not hard                                 requirement but people will projects                                 will stay in the incubator for a lot                                 longer if this doesn't happen is that                                 the people that make up the project need                                 to be diverse they need to come from                                 different companies they need the the                                 one thing we're really concerned about                                 is that if all the committers are from a                                 single company that company changes                                 direction and then you know the project                                 doesn't exist anymore we want to try and                                 stop that from happening                                 so then you decide this is us a year                                 passes you've made three or four                                 releases and you think you're ready to                                 become a top-level project so what you                                 do then is you've decided that you're                                 ready you decide that you can                                 self-govern                                 you don't need any help anymore your                                 mentors will still be around to help you                                 quite often after you graduate and you                                 know sometimes those questions that come                                 up that that haven't come up during                                 graduation and so you can discuss                                 becoming a top-level project on the                                 mailing list again in the open and then                                 vote on it and assuming that vote passes                                 that's it you're a top-level project so                                 the voting on releases is a little                                 different to some of the other voting at                                 Apache and that is that the must be kept                                 open for a minimum of                                                  allows everyone to participate even                                 people who in different time zones for                                 example and you need three plus one                                 votes and more plus one votes than minus                                 one votes a minus one is not a veto and                                 the whole idea behind this is that as                                 long as it's good enough and better than                                 the previous release that's okay it                                 doesn't have to be perfect if a release                                 is perfect than if you've tried to make                                 a release perfect you'll never ever get                                 there there always be some little                                 problem with it                                 you know that'll end up doing that so as                                 long as the majority of people agree                                 that it's a good release and it should                                 be shipped then um this is the stats on                                 Ohio I have voted on incubated releases                                                                                                    release                                                               because there was some issues there and                                 I didn't feel what and in                                               said no sorry there's a there's a                                 problem here we got to fix it and three                                 of my releases are in those                                           way and so so that's about                                               releases from me I've got the plus one                                 and I think I think that's sort of a a                                 good indicator of you know and generally                                 as a bottling goes you know through its                                 lifecycle it gets better and better and                                 better at doing it so most of those                                 minus ones are the you know the first                                 were the second releases that come out                                 um and as it doesn't have to be perfect                                 and often you do make mistakes if it's                                 not your first time doing this then it's                                 quite likely you're not going to get it                                 right for the first time ever I saw a                                 like the very first release candidate of                                 Portland's first release actually get                                 voted plus one by everyone I've only                                 ever seen that happen once so um and you                                 may also not be filled you're not                                 familiar with a s F policy at this point                                 you know you're still learning the ropes                                 and you still you know it's documented                                 but you know some of the documentation                                 needs improvement some of it is                                 scattered all over the place                                 so sometimes it's quite hard to work out                                 what you should do                                 also sometimes if you look at what other                                 projects top-level projects are doing                                 and try and copy them sometimes they're                                 not always doing the right thing either                                 either so you know you've got to be a                                 little careful about that sorry so yeah                                 and basically it's just you don't want                                 to have any surprises in your release so                                 if you if you know there's a problem in                                 the release documented and if you                                 document it then                                 you're still more likely to get the vote                                 to pass so now we're going to talk about                                 thinner act at Apache and I'm going to                                 start by talking a little bit about what                                 Finnick does what fitter act is so                                 everybody who knows anything about                                 global poverty is probably going to tell                                 me this is a really hard problem in                                 capital letters this is a problem that                                 we can't solve there's no way we can                                 solve it you think about starving                                 children in Somalia and then you're like                                 that's terrible I feel bad about that                                 but I can't do anything about it                                 and if we look at this you can see that                                 starting in the                                                      began to dramatically decline global                                 poverty in this case being being defined                                 as the number of people making the                                 yellow line the number of people making                                 less than $                                        adjusted for inflation the black or the                                 red line then is the number of people                                 making less than one dollar a day again                                 adjusted for inflation and the black                                 line on the right is one ninety a day so                                 you see that through the Industrial                                 Revolution around that time the number                                 the percentage of the worldwide                                 population living in global poverty has                                 gone dramatically down and at this point                                 where we're headed towards dipping under                                 ten percent of the worldwide population                                 despite the fact that the worldwide                                 population has been growing under ten                                 percent of the worldwide population is                                 in living in poverty yes it's still far                                 too high but we're making progress                                 against it so it must be a solvable                                 problem what if we want to solve the                                 problem what do we need to do well naive                                 person might say we just give everybody                                 enough money to have more than $                                        right well let's look at that naive                                 solution what would that mean this is                                 how much money it would cost if we were                                 to give everybody in the world who makes                                 less than $                                                           over that $                                                           progressively you see the amount of                                 money the absolute amount of money that                                 would be required to do that has gone                                 down so we started in the                                          around                                                    we're actually below                                                    clearly we are making progress but what                                 we need to finish that what do we need                                 to get that last step over over this to                                 get those last                                                      we're making the progress we're making                                 it's because of the Industrial                                 Revolution so we need something that                                 changes the playing field in the same                                 way that the Industrial Revolution                                 changed the playing field in this sort                                 of exponential way and one possibility                                 is microfinance so there are two billion                                 people on this planet who don't have                                 bank accounts anybody here ever taken                                 out a loan anybody here                                 saving for like a vacation or for                                 retirement yeah these are things that                                 are core to our financial well-being I                                 personally took out loans in order to                                 pay for my college education and I                                 wouldn't be making I wouldn't be as                                 financially well-off today as I am                                 without that if you don't have a bank                                 account there are lots of things you                                 just can't do that would make it                                 possible for you to raise yourself out                                 of poverty so in                                                     was living in a village in Bangladesh                                 and he noticed that there were women who                                 were building bamboo furniture who                                 didn't have a lot of money who were                                 trying to they were buying bamboo and in                                 order to buy their bamboo they couldn't                                 go to a bank to borrow the money the                                 banks wouldn't give them the money they                                 were too poor they had to go to loan                                 sharks and the loan sharks were lending                                 them this money at exorbitant interest                                 rates so what he did was he just he lent                                 these women their                                                       $                                                                        the bamboos they made the furniture they                                 paid back the loan with a tiny bit of                                 interest and everybody was wealthier and                                 microfinance was born so he took this                                 model and he spand it on it and he                                 founded a bank called the Grameen Bank                                 in which he loaned tiny amounts of money                                 to poor people that they could then use                                 to bill                                 businesses and to lift themselves out of                                 poverty and this was microfinance and it                                 continued by                                                             into a full-fledged Bank by                                          Grameen foundation worldwide was founded                                 it works because poor people are just                                 like rich people they want to be able to                                 contribute back to their societies they                                 want to build things they've even done                                 some studies on this microphone is                                 actually is effective in lifting people                                 out of poverty so                                                        customers who remain customers for five                                 years or more                                 exit poverty and the average credit                                 write-off is one percent the average                                 overdue rate is between three and six                                 percent so what does this have to do a                                 software so before I before I go into                                 what this has to do a software this                                 model was ordered the Nobel Peace Prize                                 in                                                                    recognized that this was very impactful                                 in in moving the world forward and one                                 one thing about this that was a little                                 bit different one reason why you were                                 able to go vend money to these to these                                 poor people is something called                                 solidarity lending so people would get                                 together into groups mostly women this                                 was mostly targeted at women they would                                 get together in groups and they would                                 say Lind one of our members the money or                                 Lind all of us together as that money                                 but as a group they would be able to say                                 if she doesn't pay it back then we will                                 come together and make up the difference                                 this just reduces the risk for the bank                                 because there's more people stepping up                                 but it also has a couple of other NACA                                 knock-on effects so there's the                                 additional social pressure positive and                                 negative other person who receives the                                 money and there is they have regular                                 meetings so that people can exchange                                 financial know how they can learn from                                 each other about how to run businesses                                 successfully this is a form of community                                 or this is an aspect of community that's                                 being leveraged here to lift people out                                 of poverty it's a community aspect that                                 I                                 so interesting about this so again what                                 does software have to do with this                                 well accounting is the oldest software                                 application there was there was                                 accounting being done on computers of                                 various sorts before computers were                                 really properly invented in their modern                                 form doing interest calculations                                 requires a lot of mundane work that                                 requires a great deal of care for a                                 human being that computers do very                                 easily and big banks use closed source                                 systems because that was the first kind                                 of system there was out there they they                                 use these very expensive systems it cost                                 millions of dollars depending on the                                 system they can they can go as low as a                                 quarter of a million dollars a year or                                 they can be massively expensive and if                                 you've got a small MFI who's serving a                                 village with                                                             a deposit of maybe two dollars you can't                                 afford these systems you can't amortize                                 it across a large number of relatively                                 wealthy customers but we've seen this                                 kind of problem at open source before                                 right how do we spread out the cost of                                 solving a problem across a large group                                 well in                                                             began to develop an open source solution                                 to banking and this solution was spun                                 off and it was became the Methos                                 initiative to me for software and this                                 software was donated to the Apache                                 Software Foundation in December of                                      in December of                                      finner Act was born came to the Apache                                 Software Foundation into the incubator                                 we were then in the incubator until                                 April of                                                        incubator for                                                            about the Apache Way about the Apache                                 release process where we scrubbed our IP                                 and now we're looking at supporting the                                 next generation of financial inclusion                                 project products so now the cell phone                                 mobile coverage has increased which                                 makes it possible to reach more                                 customers in rural areas at the same                                 time we have exciting news                                 Technologies like blockchain that we                                 need to work out how to or to what                                 extent to offer to people in need of                                 financial inclusion products a report                                 from the McKinsey Global Institute found                                 that delivering financial services by                                 mobile mobile phone could add                                     trillion dollars to the GDP of                                 developing countries by                                             enough money to create                                                 and that is enough money to to lift                                 those that last                                                       it's distributed appropriately so what                                 was our process like well the first                                 thing we did was we found a champion as                                 Justin mentioned earlier our champion                                 was Ross Garza the next thing we did was                                 we drafted well we picked a project name                                 we couldn't heat the old project name                                 because the me flows initiatives to                                 existed as an independent entity I don't                                 know if it was anybody here in was                                 anybody here in Shane's talk you can't                                 fork a brand right the me Foss brand                                 already exists so we had to pick a new                                 name to exist under at the Apache                                 Software Foundation then we had to                                 analyze the code and this was actually                                 the hardest part was to find any                                 dependencies in our code that would                                 inhibit somebody from using that code in                                 their own projects looking basically                                 looking for GPL or LGPL dependencies and                                 then we write a proposal and send it to                                 the Apache Incubator list and then we go                                 into the process that Justin has already                                 described you go through discussion                                 people ask questions we answer the                                 questions we say where we see the                                 problems then there's a vote and we were                                 voted in in December of                                      Justin mentioned earlier that                                        release candidates are accepted by the                                 incubator this is true if you've already                                 made a successful release that that sort                                 of evens it out but we had a bit of                                 trouble at the beginning we tried we                                 gave we made three releases they were                                 already                                 thank you and I mean that seriously                                 we made three release attempts I'm can                                 you remember what some of the issues                                 were they were all GPL dependencies                                 hibernate open J hibernate was we                                 replaced with open GPA to resolve those                                 issues so on our fourth try we made it                                 and we made another couple of releases                                 and once we had shown that we could make                                 releases and grow the community then we                                 were able to graduate so what does grow                                 the community actually mean well we have                                 to propose contributors how do we                                 propose contributors well we have a                                 private mailing list and we do it on                                 private so that if there somebody's                                 rejected we don't hurt any feelings we                                 have a private mailing list and the                                 project management committee that the                                 project started with proposes people who                                 have been making contributions as                                 committers we say how about him how                                 about her she's done this that and the                                 other thing we're very happy with this                                 and maybe we should give her access to                                 the direct access to the repo or also                                 the recognition that's involved with                                 being a committer so you make that you                                 make a proposal some it's the same as                                 bringing the the project into the                                 incubator you make a proposal people ask                                 questions you answer them maybe there's                                 some some controversy for the most part                                 in most cases at least in our project                                 the committers were then voted in after                                 we've done this for roughly a year we                                 went and said we think we're ready                                 thank you Bader is great but we're not                                 learning much here anymore it's time for                                 us to move on and it's time for us to                                 free those resources resources so that                                 other those mentors so that other                                 projects can come into the incubator                                 under there they're a guiding hand so we                                 sat down together and we said here are a                                 list of things that we felt like we                                 should be able to do before we leave the                                 incubator can we do them yes no what do                                 we need to do a couple of things we                                 wanted to change and we                                 and then we put that put together a                                 proposal sent it to the incubator and                                 the incubator approved it and sent it                                 onto the board once it reaches the board                                 the board then says basically the board                                 I don't know of any instance where the                                 board hasn't followed the recommendation                                 of the incubator know once that once the                                 the incubator makes the recommendation                                 to the board but the board is the                                 governing body of the Apache Software                                 Foundation and the board is the body                                 that makes the resolution this is now a                                 top-level project at Apache so this for                                 me actually has this this process of                                 building communities has a lot in common                                 with what our customer and what fin our                                 customers are doing they are building                                 communities or taking existing                                 communities and learning new things in                                 those existing communities in order to                                 help support each other and to help                                 support the rest of the world - yeah -                                 to make all of our lives a little better                                 community is what makes this work the                                 the willingness to reach out to another                                 person and help them and to want to be                                 able to do something for other people so                                 how do you make the world a better place                                 well contribute to a community and at                                 this whites are there any questions well                                 thanks for the presentation and just out                                 of curiosity I was interested to know                                 who was backing the contributors for                                 this community                                 so what companies were employing them                                 and is it always good their relationship                                 with those companies or do you ever get                                 like political pressure to get                                 committees or users promoted to                                 commuters and so there are several                                 companies you haven't heard of backing                                 this starting with the Memphis                                 initiative which is a nonprofit they did                                 at that point paid contributors I was                                 working for the Memphis initiative when                                 we entered incubation there's also a                                 couple of companies that do service                                 software as a service for MF eyes                                 microfinance Institute's                                 they so if there's Missoni for the                                 netherlands and there's conflicts from                                 india they also both have contributors                                 and we also have a lot of individual                                 contributors so we actually we rely                                 probably more than any other Apache                                 project on contributions from google                                 Summer of Code which requires a fair bit                                 of organization and yeah at a patchy as                                 a whole only about half the contributors                                 are actually fully employed by a company                                 at the other half at volunteers and do                                 it in this spare time                                 yeah and that's we like people doing it                                 in their spare time because they tend to                                 be very passionate we also like people                                 doing it for companies because they tend                                 to be very consistent these are these                                 are two good things that you can combine                                 together so yeah does that answer your                                 question                                 any more questions you mentioned that                                 it's not so big problem if release is                                 not excellent but what about if some                                 other is still contain some problematic                                 license code with problematic license is                                 it a problem or did you take this um                                 well it it's easily fixed you make                                 another release so but all there is will                                 be available from the Apache sides right                                 you'll release will be fixed but what                                 about dollar isn't it a problem well it                                 depends what what sort of issues are                                 you're talking about you know if                                 something is broken and it doesn't work                                 you know kind of really know some gpo                                 problem if there's if a release produces                                 some sort of legal jeopardy for the                                 customers then it won't get released                                 that's yeah the the like much those most                                 of those minus one votes were there were                                 because they had compiled code in a                                 source release the second most thing I                                 vote minus one on is is because of in                                 compatible licenses and that's usually                                 fairly easy to check it's not often                                 hidden so okay okay thanks                                 one more question has it ever happened                                 that somebody some contributor out of                                 not knowing it's signed of these                                 intellectual like this this writes off                                 and but but ever like did an error in                                 this and and you ended up having                                 problems with contaminations in in terms                                 of having code like I mean like because                                 it at some point contributors they sort                                 of say that that they have the right to                                 give if those those those things away                                 but I mean as a human and if you've                                 written a lot of code and you might not                                 know where you know if your practices                                 aren't really completely clean and you                                 might have gotten something from                                 somewhere like ever happened or I can                                 think of a couple cases where that has                                 happened and it's generally being found                                 out and fixed so that the offending code                                 has been removed that doesn't mean that                                 with you know every single case that was                                 good it's generally fairly obvious                                 because the code is not in the same                                 style as the rest or there may be some                                 odd comments or something in there like                                 there's just a few little things that                                 you can see that well trigger you to                                 think a well I wonder where that is from                                 and these days you can just do a search                                 on the internet and find if the code was                                 from somewhere else and there you go I                                 yeah okay that's where it came from and                                 and this is where the four-eyes                                 principle or the twenty eyes principle                                 because it's very important is that's                                 the only way to find things like that if                                 you do find something like that then the                                 only thing you can do is remove the code                                 and either just remove it or replace it                                 well it depends what the license of the                                 code is okay yeah so it could actually                                 become from somewhere else that had a                                 compatible license and in that for                                 you've just got to recognize that and                                 say yep this code came from here and                                 that's all good so if you're curious                                 about licensing issues we have a                                 workshop right after this that we will                                 be going in more detail through                                 licensing and releases so any more                                 questions I think we are                                 on time by now so thank you very much                                 Moreland trusting                                 [Applause]
