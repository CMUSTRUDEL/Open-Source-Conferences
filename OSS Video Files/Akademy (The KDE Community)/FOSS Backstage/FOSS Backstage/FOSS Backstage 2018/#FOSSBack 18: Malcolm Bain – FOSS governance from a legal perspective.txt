Title: #FOSSBack 18: Malcolm Bain – FOSS governance from a legal perspective
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	This session looks at the benchmarking, analysis and recommendations carried out from a legal perspective for setting up an organisation to manage/govern a public sector open source community. We look at both legal organisational structures as well as the roles, responsibilities and key legal decisions that are part of "legal governance" of open source projects: Members, Boards, Committees, voting processes and requirements, licensing, trademarks, and liabilities

	                              okay we're gonna have to think it's nice                               and sunny outside okay well good                               afternoon and sorry about the slight                               delay here this is the kind of the                               temperature in Berlin and the the the                               state of the sunshine and I have the                               honor to have the last talk in the main                               rooms which obviously is everybody's now                               outside in the beer garden and and so so                                and it's a pleasure to be here I think                                you're doing it pretty bad because you                                started the day with legal compliance                                and you're ending the day with legal                                governance there's something wrong in                                this way I know I just want to take off                                from the previous talk about exactly if                                you are going to set up a governance                                structure what are the kind of like                                conditions and criteria and what are the                                steps that it would be what do you need                                to take into account to do this in a way                                and this is because we've been working                                with Barcelona City Council in freeing                                quite a lot of software and they're                                looking at how to make these projects                                more independent from the government                                from the public authority and so that                                they can gain more sustainability more                                more adherence from from from other                                other projects okay so obviously the                                government's role the structure                                basically defines roles procedures and                                responsibilities and and this always                                happens in any community actually                                whether it's kind of like three people                                or or                                                                   of implicit or explicit governance                                structure what happens if you're                                actually thinking of setting up an                                entity is that what many many things                                that are implicit become structured                                become formal and the the whole process                                of creating this type of entity legal                                entity or whatever it is foundation                                nonprofit whatever entails a deep                                reflection about exactly what those                                roles processes rules are that you want                                to set because actually once if you do                                have a fixed entity or a legal entity                                it's much more difficult to change than                                if you're just an unorganized or                                disorganized or unform alized and                                community obviously the key questions                                you need to look at are so if you're                                thinking of governance model what what                                effects that                                what's the creep creep criterias take                                into account when you're looking at the                                governance model                                and who's going to take this decision                                what do we have to understand so that we                                get a governance model that is                                appropriate for the community                                it's obviously normally different for a                                you know post University small project                                starting up from something enormous like                                Apache or Mozilla Foundation which have                                their own very strict and you know what                                strict or sort of established governance                                was okay                                so obviously what one looks at and this                                is what we've been trying to look at for                                the for the projects in in the in City                                Council is is that the different                                dimensions characteristics because it's                                very very different and creating a                                project which is an infrastructure                                project to an end user web application                                type thing the stakeholders are a                                completely different the people who                                involved are very different                                I'm the motivation for freeing the                                project is is different the ecosystem                                where you are that the technology you're                                using may be completely different now we                                see these are factors that you need to                                take into account and look at one of the                                key issues we've found is the timing so                                what time in the life cycle of a project                                from from it when it starts two or three                                people or the government putting in some                                money to sponsor a new piece of                                technology for the government                                infrastructure and you know when are we                                going to formalize this when do or do in                                in at any moment you actually need to                                formalize it into a legal entity or not                                that's very very very important                                obviously taking this stuff is not the                                 end of the in everything you can't                                 visitings but the cost of change                                 obviously is quite high I'm quoting                                 quite difficult so that's one of the em                                 but the factors we we look at to decide                                 you know do we want something that's                                 very formal do something that's very                                 informal do something that's very                                 process heavy do we want to formalize it                                 in documents do we want to have a                                 conflict you know conflict explicit                                 conflict resolution process so how do we                                 want to structure our community okay so                                 we've we've looked at and and we've done                                 it in nine steps obviously you know it                                 could be                                                                 kind of come up with I think eight steps                                 and some documentation that the things                                 to look at useful things to look at and                                 I'll run through these very quickly                                 a bit one by one because I'm a lawyer                                 and we'd like to go kind of like                                 developers we do things a little bit in                                 a structured way so the legal editor                                 must be decide on is is what components                                 so these roles rights and obligations                                 obligations the decision-making system                                 so that obviously is a procedural thing                                 it's nothing to do with a legal                                 structure yet okay good then what we've                                 looked at is those roles procedures then                                 get put into a box let's go get a                                 presenter structure and the question is                                 well what is the best structure to put                                 it under and this obviously will depend                                 on the country depend on objective but                                 that's the the reflection needs to be                                 there is do we need anything at all                                 there's a bit what I'm Cornelius was                                 saying you know if you don't need it                                 don't do it because it's it's expensive                                 it's formalizes something that may be                                 better if it's informal and it                                 crystallizes a certain way of doing                                 things which may be the community or the                                 technology you're building actually does                                 not go in that direction okay and then                                 specifically from a legal perspective                                 what what's the legal dimensions that                                 get managed by this entity and here we                                 go obviously at the IPR we got license                                 got trademarks and and even some form of                                 conflict resolution okay so the the st.                                 next stage is okay once you decided well                                 we're going to go down this path and we                                 do need to formalize our governance                                 structure and we may actually have to                                 create or thinking of creating a new                                 entity what are the what's the purpose                                 of this and key here and in our project                                 for the City Council was to create a                                 certain level of Independence from the                                 original seed of the seeding which was                                 in the council to create an entity which                                 is more independent and therefore it's                                 more open in a certain way to receive                                 other contributions to receive other                                 participants taking part in in the                                 governance it's not just one single                                 public authority who's governing this                                 entity but it's opening its doors to                                 other entities okay another typical                                 reason would be for financial reasons if                                 you want to participate in any funding                                 projects if you want to have any kind of                                 a formal contractual relationship with                                 sponsors or whatever it's RC very useful                                 to have a legal entity who can you know                                 sign on and sign a contract enter into                                 contract so there are there are several                                 reasons for this it may be actually that                                 you have a very informal                                 and a bit disorganized project you think                                 this is one of the ways to formalize it                                 to set up to set some bylaws or other                                 form of governments and documents and                                 and rules and make it a little bit more                                 less chaotic okay                                 so these are the slides I'll leave                                 before anderson discussions that we've                                 had between different types of things                                 the next one is when you're building                                 this or you're designing this entity or                                 this governance structure and i say                                 still governor structure because you may                                 not in the end have an entity at all                                 what are the characteristics that you                                 have to try and really focus on okay and                                 I think there are four ones that we've                                 we've when benchmarking other projects                                 from our own experience there are four                                 criteria here which which I think are                                 absolutely important essential to                                 respect if you're going to go down this                                 road the first one is it has to be very                                 participate or the whole community has                                 to be actually consulted and and joined                                 in clarity and simplicity                                 don't make it too heavy anything it's                                 too heavy obviously is not going to work                                 that hard a flexibility so build in                                 mechanisms for evolving as the                                 technology evolves of the community                                 evolves it's very important that your                                 governance and procedures can evolve as                                 well and finally transparency                                 transparency means publishing this                                 information making its available so that                                 new members coming into this structure                                 or this process can actually join and                                 see what's going on how its managed okay                                 what do you what does one actually                                 decide about what I want to look at well                                 there are levels so there's the micro                                 level of personal level interpersonal                                 there's the kind of like the community                                 internal dynamics of the project itself                                 and there's the Metro level which is                                 external the community and its                                 relationship with the outside and that                                 could be something like different                                 projects associating with each other and                                 building something larger                                 it could be just purely financial and                                 some form of financial relationship with                                 it with some sponsor or government                                 funding okay and within actually when                                 you're in the the the process we think                                 that there are four main areas obviously                                 legal being lawyers obviously the legal                                 becomes first is the most important and                                 then a Cornelius the software comes                                 first we know that okay the community                                 probably comes first actually it's about                                 people and the technical                                 the money now if there's any economists                                 in the room we all know that money comes                                 first but um anyway they're all equally                                 important let's just put it that way                                 let's be a bit more democratic and they                                 all need to be looked at okay and the                                 slides for those who are watching you                                 can look you can look at them this is                                 quite a lot of work that we've done in                                 in these different dimensions so so in                                 in the legal just for example what type                                 of membership rules the bylaws of this                                 association all this an entity that                                 you're looking at what are the formal                                 documentation in in terms of IPR in                                 contribution agreements we've talked                                 about a lot about contribution                                 agreements trademark management IP our                                 licensing convening this type of thing                                 that's the legal competence and what                                 there's stuff about community technical                                 and economic which I won't go on ok so                                 you've decided to that you do actually                                 want to set up a more formal governance                                 structure you've thought about the whys                                 and the who's and the how's so then we                                 look at and then then you say well                                 within this structure what do we do so                                 it's the previous slide and now we say                                 well who does it who's actually going to                                 be I'm governing this this this                                 community or this this structure again                                 benchmarking traditional open-source                                 projects and actually larger entities we                                 usually there seems to be three or four                                 levels there's usually in a form of                                 assembly which means everybody who                                 participates in the community has a                                 voice then there's usually obviously for                                 more efficiency management purposes                                 there's a some form of board which could                                 be an ex-con executive committee or                                 whatever but this is the kind of the                                 day-to-day decision taking which then                                 may also delegate to one layer down to                                 committees so you may have a community                                 committee a technical committee a                                 management committee a finance committee                                 it's allocating specific                                 responsibilities to members of the                                 community so they can focus on or on                                 what's needed I mean when I say                                 committee it could be one person on a                                 committee of one which is great for                                 voting purposes because you always have                                 unanimity and then below that again                                 working groups and obviously you know I                                 think plan Drupal these very very large                                 organizations have significant different                                 dynamics than if it's you know one a                                 free man show or three lady show                                 but in the end the the what one looks at                                 is generally these four levels of                                 decision                                 okay so there's debates and what what to                                 do with the assembly I'm who should be a                                 member of the board what the rules of                                 the board how'd you get them on board                                 how'd you get rid get rid of them                                 committees what decisions do they take                                 what responsibilities what's the process                                 long and obviously someone like a patch                                 it has it has very committee based and                                 they are very strong procedural systems                                 in there come in in their committees                                 other ones not so okay couple of                                 examples here actually we looked at                                 asana which is the public administration                                 entity in the USA on half application                                 and they have their governance                                 structures divided into two so they have                                 a council which is basically the public                                 authorities are participating                                 stakeholders and they have a core team                                 and with some admin staff very important                                 admin staff because the community                                 managers there and this is kind of                                 division of roles between strategic and                                 and financing issues and knowledge and                                 actually running the show okay one go                                 into plan bit too complex but it's also                                 an interesting one okay meetings and                                 events that's also something that's very                                 very important because this is the glue                                 that brings the community together and                                 and running those meetings running those                                 events Lashley's is heavy work it's a                                 lot of heavy lifting and very important                                 for the for governance to take into                                 account so we've got all the substance                                 of what we're going to do what box do we                                 put it in and whose it may depend on the                                 country I mean they're you know them in                                 the USA they everything's a foundation                                 but if you look behind it they're not                                 always what we would call a foundation                                 often there are nonprofit entities                                 corporations whatever usually for tax                                 reasons this is very different from a                                 German foundation version from the                                 Spanish what we would call in fundación                                 in Spain Association so this really                                 builds specific to the jurisdiction                                 which may raise the question in which to                                 restriction which country do you want                                 missus to be because you know often                                 these projects are international and                                 although there may be some dominant                                 feature like in my projects it's it's                                 Spain in the end you may say well no                                 let's go to the UK well no it breaks it                                 we don't go to the UK let's go to                                 Belgium for example let's come to Berlin                                 and and this is a good place to be                                 and                                 we have a look at the legal structures                                 available in that jurisdiction so I run                                 through run through these but details                                 for the slides so you know what you want                                 to do                                 you've got the box to put it in okay as                                 a lawyer obviously I like to focus on                                 what are the specific legal dimensions                                 over the management and usually this is                                 one thing hopefully to deal with put in                                 the box and never touch again this is                                 kind of the best system because you know                                 the IP I once it's fixed good we know we                                 have our processes and conflict                                 resolution we never want any conflicts                                 and obviously we certainly don't want                                 any liabilities so if you have to pull                                 your legal process box out of there you                                 were probably in bad news anyway what do                                 we look at well we look at IPR which is                                 obviously the most important                                 intellectual property rights copyrights                                 in the code pattern problems for some                                 projects we look at contracting with                                 third parties if you have actually                                 sponsors this in for example in the                                 public authority community is quite                                 important because quite a lot of the                                 development is under public contracts                                 and and therefore you know how that is                                 organized and who has the IPR through                                 the public contracts is quite an                                 important factor to take into account                                 very different from a purely voluntary                                 committee community where there is no                                 specific public involvement okay so we                                 look at that we look at liabilities and                                 how to minimize those this is why you                                 have these big disclaimers and license                                 and then formal conflict resolution if                                 things really really get hot and you                                 can't resolve this through the usual                                 community processes okay                                 so again very briefly I've already                                 mentioned most of this so I think what                                 we're seeing in the more formal projects                                 is that everything we've been talking                                 about today what was Shane was                                 mentioning this morning in terms of                                 compliance open-chain looking at                                 screening looking at code this is                                 something naturally is getting more                                 important as projects gets larger and                                 larger and obviously the exposure to                                 having any issue is greater so that that                                 does need to be taken to account and                                 looked after carefully okay                                 what else trademark more and more                                 projects are registering their                                 trademarks it's it's their brand it's                                 their identification and it's often when                                 there's a fork that has a problem but                                 it's one way for a community to focus on                                 and keep people involved is through                                 their recognition of who they are you                                 know like things I'm on my t-shirt and                                 everything like this                                 okay um finally so once you've done all                                 that the question is well how do you get                                 there because we've with all this great                                 intellectual work no way we want how do                                 we actually get there and obviously the                                 basic rule is you don't do it by                                 yourself you don't impose it top down                                 like in any open source community you                                 have to speak with the members of the                                 community and you have to them to say                                 usually on a consensus or silent                                 consensus lazy consensus and that's the                                 way we're going okay break it down into                                 packages so it makes it easy because it                                 can seem to be a really enormous thing                                 to look at all this legal business                                 management community stuff break you                                 down into packages and it makes it much                                 more manageable and you'll probably find                                 it's really good because the person who                                 looks after each package suddenly                                 becomes the person responsible for                                 community management and later on in                                 this association and finally obviously                                 documentation how do you document this                                 well depends on what type of institution                                 you have usually have some bylaws you                                 have some internal regulations if you                                 look at mozilla apache there's a typical                                 foundation eclipse foundation very large                                 but other ones that poem they all                                 document everything they do transparent                                 on a wiki don't keep those documents                                 hidden in any manner and hopefully you                                 don't have to pull them out of the                                 drawer yeah my experience as a lawyer if                                 you have to start looking at the                                 documents you're in hot water it's if                                 you're already in trouble okay usually                                 you want them to be put away in a box                                 forget about them and then everything                                 the community takes care after itself                                 okay                                 that's basic we don't to say basically                                 we're wrapping up obviously an entity                                 legal entity adds a layer of complexity                                 a delay of cost so if you can avoid it                                 maybe it's a good idea but there are                                 there may and they usually are some                                 significant in good reasons to set up a                                 specific legal entity a financial                                 reasons                                 tax reasons you're going very very                                 international and people want to know                                 what the rules of the game are so you                                 have to express those rules and and one                                 way to do that obviously have community                                 documentation and at one moment maybe                                 membership and things it's also question                                 of commitment the actual fact that you                                 do incorporate all that you do creates                                 an entity means that you're committed in                                 there for the long term                                 you're looking for something you're                                 looking for sustainability it's not                                 something that tomorrow the lead                                 developers disappear and you've got                                 nothing left except some code hidden in                                 a git repository if you do actually have                                 an entity you're making a political                                 statement that we want to be here we                                 want to be here for the next period and                                 we've we want to do it properly                                 thank you very much                                 [Applause]
