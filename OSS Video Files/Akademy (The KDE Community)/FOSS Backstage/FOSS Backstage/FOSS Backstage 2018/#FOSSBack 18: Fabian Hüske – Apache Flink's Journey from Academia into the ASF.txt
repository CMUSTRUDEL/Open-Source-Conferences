Title: #FOSSBack 18: Fabian Hüske – Apache Flink's Journey from Academia into the ASF
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Apache Flink is a project with a very active, supportive, and continuously growing community. Last year, Flink was among the top ten projects of the Apache Software Foundation  (ASF) with the most traffic on user and development mailing lists. Looking back, Flink started as a research prototype developed by three PhD students at TU Berlin in 2009. In 2014, the developers donated the code base to the Apache Software Foundation and joined the newly founded Apache Flink incubator project. Within three years, Flink grew into a healthy project and gained a lot of momentum.

In my presentation, I will discuss Flink's journey from an academic research project to one of the most active projects of the Apache Software Foundation. I will talk about the academic roots of the project, how the original developers got introduced to the ASF, Flink's incubation phase, and how its community evolved after it graduated and became an ASF top-level project. My talk will focus on the decisions, efforts, and circumstances that helped to grow a vital and welcoming open source community.

	                              yeah thank you thanks everybody for for                               for for joining this talk yeah it's the                               title says I'm going to share the story                               of how yeah the about the origins of                               Apache flying how it started as an                               academic research project not talking                               very much about that part but then like                               how we moved it into into the Apache                               Software Foundation and what we did to                                grow community and a few lessons learned                                about that first of all a few words                                about what is a Petri flink                                to to get the context right it is                                obviously an open source project of the                                Apache sofa foundation the software is                                it's a stream processor that processes                                data with low latency at scale so it's a                                distributed system you deploy it in a                                cluster and then it processes streams of                                data and it consists of API so obviously                                to define the the processing that the                                job that you want to run and also the                                execution engine                                it runs on clusters from various size so                                you can run it on a single machine you                                can also and deploy it on classes to up                                to like a couple of thousands machines                                and it has a very very active community                                and also have for community what are the                                common use cases for fleeing so it's                                used for a typical stream processing                                applications like fraud detection I know                                anomaly detection real-time analytics                                machine learning or just crunching data                                in an instrument fashion in general the                                software Apache flying is used by by                                many companies of various various                                different industries such as telcos                                there is there's retail there is typical                                tech companies so it's really really                                deployed or at many many different                                companies so how did this all start so                                the software started out as an academic                                research project back then it was called                                stratosphere the project was funded by                                the German                                fortunes come and stuff which is likely                                the German equivalent of the NSF in the                                US so it's a it's an government-funded                                institution to fund research projects                                and the mission of the project was to to                                develop the next generation big data big                                data analytics platform and for that                                back then the project started in                                        like did a little bit initial work                                before that                                so the goal back then was to develop a                                system that uses MapReduce and                                relational database technology there                                were a couple of research groups                                involved so this was a fairly big                                project so something like six seven PhD                                students five professors a couple of                                master students working working on this                                and it also got additional funding from                                from additional EU projects and got by                                that connected in two different research                                institutes in Europe and yeah we all set                                a pretty good track record on scientific                                publications so a couple of years later                                the first generation of PhD students was                                about to leave and we are a software                                that was in which we put like more than                                three years of development of something                                like many many people so a couple of                                person years went through this software                                it was back then                                state of the art had a couple of very                                unique and distinguishing features and                                back then we had already released it as                                under the Apache License so we asked                                ourselves ok I mean we had released it                                but nobody actually used it                                so we asked herself ok how can we                                continue and we didn't really want to                                abandon the project just angry way like                                all these three years of work and say ok                                that's it we're going to do something                                else now                                so a natural like thought was ok we'd                                like to continue that maybe as an as an                                open-source project and there was                                another thought as well so we were here                                in Berlin we like the city we don't                                really want to                                move somewhere else and it's not that                                easy to find another place or to find                                find find a job in Berlin or back then                                at least we could work on on similar                                 technology so we we thought okay maybe                                 let's try this make make a make a proper                                 open-source project out of a Petri flink                                 fund start start a startup and let's see                                 how it gave us and that's basically what                                 we did and so about the open source part                                 releasing the surface open source                                 well releasing software is open source                                 is one thing but then there is a couple                                 of other things to it right so you need                                 to get people to use the software you                                 also want to build a community of people                                 contributing through the project and                                 make it attractive for people to                                 contribute there you have to figure out                                 licensing setting up the infrastructure                                 the whole legal framework around an open                                 source project so all of that is not                                 that easy to not eat not that easy to do                                 and there's lots of challenges to tackle                                 about that and luckily there's                                 organizations or open source                                 organizations that exactly help to help                                 projects to to tackle most of these                                 problems and the Apache Software                                 Foundation was kind of like a network                                 choice for us and why is that so first                                 of all we got in touch with quite a few                                 people from the Apache Software                                 Foundation he's about to host the                                 co-organizer of this of this conference                                 here was a guest lecturer at to Berlin                                 there were other Apache committers and                                 members in our research group the Berlin                                 Basterds conference that just was was                                 the two days before this conference had                                 started here which brought in many open                                 source people Titanic was one of the                                 people we talked to so we got a lots of                                 exposure to to Apache Forks here we also                                 spoke at conferences we also spoke quite                                 early at a                                 but in passwords and other conferences                                 about the stratosphere project back then                                 and of course there were also lots of                                 other projects in this big data                                 processing domain that were hosted at                                 the Apache Software Foundation like the                                 euro here just a few of them there is                                 like if I would put all the logos on                                 there you wouldn't see any text anymore                                 so it's like this is basically like the                                 home for most of these kinds of projects                                 so therefore the Apache Software                                 Foundation was like the the first place                                 we were looking at so how did we how do                                 if you then start this yeah so in                                      and in April we basically or a bit                                 before that we made a proposal to the                                 Apache Incubator like the regular                                 entering process for Kota nations to                                 become Apache projects so we made a                                 proposal to the incubator and in April                                 the stratosphere codebase basically                                 entered the SF incubator we had to                                 switch to the name stratosphere kind of                                 like a very common name so there's lots                                 of software and a few more software and                                 also companies with that name so we had                                 to come up with another name and we                                 decided to name give give the so for the                                 name flink which is named german for                                 nimble and swift and we came up with                                 this cute squirrel logo because it's                                 nimble and Swift animal and the initial                                 commuters were like the cost status we                                 developers and the main trust from the                                 purchase of foundation so in incubation                                 you we did all the usual stuff we                                 basically set up the infrastructure soft                                 licensing issues we started growing the                                 community mostly from students that had                                 already worked with us through these EU                                 project collaborations which was very                                 very helpful so we already had a couple                                 of people contributing to the project                                 that we then could make emitters and we                                 had a pretty good start first official                                 release was done in August and already                                 in December fling graduated to an RPG                                 to a to a top level protection in the                                 same year we also funded data artisans                                 the startup that I was talking about                                 it's based here in Berlin a venture                                 capital fund that as usual and yeah it                                 was funded by the core core stratosphere                                 team and then some of the flink emitters                                 the initial goal of the company was                                 basically we devoted like                                           resources towards fostering a pet chief                                 link our goal was basically make this                                 like a like a like a visible project in                                 the in the landscape in the potato                                 landscape so our main goal was to grow                                 community around that helping users                                 mentoring contributors helping them to                                 become committers at some point but also                                 gaining mindshare for this project and                                 of course also developing flink adding                                 new features fixing bugs and so on so                                 how did we grow a community or what did                                 we do there so back in                                                   the landscape of projects was kind of                                 like competitive it still is but we also                                 saw that there is a clear need for for                                 further technology that the the Sofia                                 was offering so there was a clear need                                 for for advanced big data analytics to                                 its and there's the walls and there                                 still is lots of projects around there                                 so probably most prominently Apache                                 spark there's a couple of other projects                                 in periban also h                                                    projects we also backed by some kind of                                 companies or other either big companies                                 or also startups with lots of more                                 funding than we had we were in Berlin                                 where our money is not as flowing as                                 freely as in other places and so we                                 somehow had to compete with these                                 organizations or with these more                                 projects when projects don't really                                 compete but still it's a you you're                                 trying to get mindshare and if there's                                 somebody adds more mindshare you you                                 think ok what can you do about it so how                                 how did we approach this well first of                                 all when you try to get try to get more                                 mindful for project you have to do a lot                                 of talking so you're speaking at                                 conferences meetups you're writing blog                                 posts                                 you try to find early partners and users                                 that then that you can then help to also                                 become evangelists for your software and                                 data artisans the startup started to                                 quite early organize a fling focus                                 conference think forward we started here                                 in Berlin in in April we had the like                                 the second edition in San Francisco and                                 in this in this event we of course had                                 people talk giving talks about a passive                                 link how they use it initially these                                 were mostly from academic partner so and                                 academic projects that they did with                                 link but we also organize hackathons and                                 enter trainings to show people how the                                 system works and back in these days we                                 already gained a few few early adopters                                 ResearchGate which is a company here                                 from Berlin King which is from Sweden                                 Stockholm a boy telecom in France so we                                 had a first first early adopters of the                                 software of this software um however it                                 didn't really take off that well and we                                 figured that is like we were kind of                                 competing with others on the very same                                 we try to do this the same as other                                 other projects we're doing and we often                                 hear it ok this is an interesting                                 software this might have like technical                                 tech technology wise it might be                                 advanced but it is less mature it has                                 less adoption and at that point in time                                 we realized that better being better at                                 something doesn't really cut it so                                 unless you're really but                                                 magnitude better community in my chair                                 is makes a lot may mix up a lot for                                 maybe not having the latest technology                                 and in general it's easier to to evolve                                 technology than to grow community so at                                 that point in time we also figured ok                                 stream processing is an interesting                                 interesting trend that might that we                                 might might go into and we looked at the                                 existing solutions and they all had had                                 significant drawbacks and we thought                                 this is something that we can do better                                 so at that point in time we basically                                 put our resources mostly in stream                                 processing features back that before                                 that was mostly like batch processing                                 and at that point in time we we noticed                                 that this is really something that is                                 that is useful for many for many users                                 because we evolved the software in a way                                 that we added features that no one else                                 at that point in time had and we also                                 saw that this software now is going is                                 being used for for more business                                 critical tasks and also so that people                                 are or companies who use the software                                 let their their the employees contribute                                 back to the projects and in around that                                 phase of the project we or the project                                 got some users like Alibaba Netflix in                                 uber which are clearly big users that                                 can give a statement about hey we're                                 using this software today a Petre fling                                 has more than                                                                                                                                and last year thing was among the among                                 the top ten projects of the Apache                                 Software Foundation with the most                                 mailing list traffic flink runs at runs                                 some of the world's largest stream                                 processing applications today users                                 follow trillions of events per day                                 through the software and and use it to                                 to solve their data problems so what are                                 the lessons to learn that we did we                                 basically took out of this first of all                                 going with the Apache Software                                 Foundation was a really good choice for                                 us because it helped us some very in                                 various ways first of all you get legal                                 protection it helps of course also with                                 the exposure but also there is like the                                 the people in the incubator that help                                 you that that can can share a lot of the                                 experience how to grow a community what                                 what to do and what not to do too                                 to attract people to good people users                                 and contributors to your project so that                                 was a very helpful also the inertia                                 community that we got through our                                 academic roots and academia                                 helped us so we had already like the                                 services software was used in multiple                                 EU projects so we had a couple of                                 contributors already through these                                 collaborations early on growing a                                 community yeah it's it's a lot of work                                 it's a lot of talking as well but also                                 what we found is that it's that was                                 essential for fleeing to find it's right                                 right niche so to say like being in this                                 stream processing niche doing something                                 that nobody are offering some some                                 features that nobody else offer us being                                 the first one that of course also helps                                 a lot                                 enterprise software is a very                                 competitive space it's very hard for                                 projects without full-time developers to                                 build up a community to have to convince                                 people like also companies to use this                                 software since it's enterprise software                                 this your your natural users are                                 companies who want to who are asking                                 who's who's backing this community is a                                 very very important part of that but it                                 is we also heard a couple of times that                                 it is important that there is also some                                 entity behind or within the community so                                 together with a community that has a                                 vested interest in in in growing the                                 growing the community and and having                                 those under the project what are today's                                 challenges yeah so we have to keep up                                 with growing the community maintaining a                                 community is also a lot of work so                                 helping users discussing roadmap                                 features features that other and that                                 contributors want to want to contribute                                 onboarding new committers and then also                                 finding this right balance of okay user                                 requests and driving a long-term vision                                 for the project for this affair this is                                 all kind of challenging and I think like                                 the next or no not the next stop but the                                 talk after that we hear something about                                 how projects can can can cope with many                                 contributors so last the last thing I                                 would would like to share i working on                                 open source is very very rewarding it's                                 a fun way of developing being in touch                                 with the people who use a software                                 they're hearing the ideas how they want                                 to how they envision this of it to                                 evolve is is very nice and of course                                 it's also very rewarding to see that the                                 software that you're working on it's                                 used in a in many different places                                 yeah so this is the conference we spoke                                 about so we'll have the next edition in                                 in Berlin in September here exactly -                                 cool - of are I in begin of September so                                 if this is something that you're                                 interested in please sign up and with                                 that I'd like your saying thank you yeah                                 thank you Fabian for this interesting                                 talk especially if it's building based                                 and from stratosphere so are there any                                 questions                                 oh yes see you not good my question                                 would be how did you convince the big                                 enterprises to adopt flink like you                                 mentioned Airbnb Netflix and all those                                 whether purely because you had a niche                                 feature set compared to spark streaming                                 or other technologies I think it in the                                 so yeah we did not really reach out to                                 them so for instance for for Alibaba or                                 we like they they approached us and told                                 us okay we're using your software                                 and I think what really it was this not                                 being better at something ads were being                                 better being slightly better at some                                 something that somebody else is doing                                 who has a bigger community it was really                                 this being able to do something that                                 nobody else can do at that point in time                                 so it's really having these features I                                 mean I didn't really go into the details                                 of what flink is doing but having                                 features like exactly once processing                                 and event and processing event time                                 semantics this is something that no                                 other stream processing open-source                                 stream processing system back then could                                 do so I'm I'm my my explanation is like                                 that these features have helped to win                                 these users for for the software you                                 mentioned that you have a lot of mailing                                 list traffic and one thing that I hear a                                 lot from new Apache projects is that                                 mailing lists are a thing from the past                                 and we should go move beyond them I'm                                 curious did were you already using                                 mailing lists as your main channel                                 before you join Apache or did you adapt                                 to that for Apache so the development                                 before that was mainly centered at                                 Huebel and so I mean sure we had some                                 communications with also external                                 contributors but they were not really I                                 mean these were all project partners                                 from from academic projects so we had                                 really not there was a mailing list but                                 it was barely used yeah so I mean this                                 mailing list thing was was pretty new to                                 us how to deal with that we get requests                                 sometimes from users to add something or                                 to offer something like a select channel                                 but so far on the community didn't                                 really go into that I'm not sure like if                                 I would get anything done if we were                                 they with that                                 okay thank you very much Fabian and                                 thank you the audience                                 [Applause]
