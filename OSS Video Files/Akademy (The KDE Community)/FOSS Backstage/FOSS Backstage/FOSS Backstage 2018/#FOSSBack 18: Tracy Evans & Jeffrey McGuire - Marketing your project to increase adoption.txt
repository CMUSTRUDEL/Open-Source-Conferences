Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Tracy Evans & Jeffrey McGuire talking about "Marketing Your Project to Increase Adoption and Grow Community".

Are you managing an open source project? How much does this matter to your reputation, business, or bottom line? This session will provide practical takeaways to help you reach the right audience and open up productive lines of communication with your project’s users and community members. This session is suitable for beginners to marketing.

From predictable release schedules and release notes; to the differences between tutorials, guides, and documentation; and yes, to your promotional schedule–marketing touches on all aspects of communication between your users and your product. This is Marketing through the lens of technical communication. We’ll look at marketing from an open source perspective and consider how you can apply well established techniques to help your project and community thrive.

Users don’t want to see their feature requests or bug reports sink into a black hole; they expect transparent communications; and they expect to be able to contribute improvements directly. What are popular open source projects doing right (and wrong) now and why? No matter the size, whether you have a new module, a theme, an integration, or a full distribution; you can probably find ways to improve your technical and marketing communications.

We often think of marketing as hyperbole or BS, but if you are authentic and accurate in your promotional communications, you can even market to developers :-) You’ll leave this session with a practical checklist of how you can improve the marketing and communication of your open source project to increase adoption and grow your user community.

	                              that's alright that's fair when we                               create marketing content which is a lot                               of what we do I am currently the hardest                               nails                               fine I have the final editorial say and                               value judgments that we can't back up                               right things that are hard to measure I                               get very nervous about those I try and                               cut them out as much as possible right                                because what you have then is a room or                                an Internet full of geeks who are like                                oh yeah how do you prove to me that                                they're interesting cameramen wants me                                in the light ok - here - there there ok                                sorry                                I'll do my best here so hey um yes so                                marketing this is the stuff we love to                                hate right                                and developers who live in a fact-based                                reality right what do you think of you                                know bingo so there is such a                                thing as bad marketing and you know bad                                marketing will send the wrong message to                                the wrong audience and try to manipulate                                you or try and sell you stuff that                                doesn't exist yet or use words the wrong                                way you know or not like develop a                                relationship with you so so that is not                                what we are about at open strategy                                partners we we work with technology

                               MBA and structure in a formal education                                and experience in in real business stuff                                so from enterprises right through to                                startups and what have you I came out of                                picking up a Drupal the open source CMS                                because I had a classical chamber music                                group that needed a website that I                                couldn't afford to pay for I was the                                                                                                     Tucker is about                                                      later and I have fallen into a deep and                                very well-appointed hole that is the                                beautiful open source community so I                                have a lot of strong ideas about                                communications and how to connect people                                and so on and we put those two things                                together came up with this company needs                                are incredibly it is our incredible                                privilege to have Heather James Heather                                McNamee now on board since January she's                                a incredible pedagogue and trainer and                                and technical communicators so that's us                                that's open strategy partners we we                                picked up somebody else two weeks ago                                which is exciting so we're doing okay                                it's it's fun so far this is the first                                time we're giving this talk this is sort                                of the current state as of literally                                this morning about this topic and it                                reflects a lot of our thinking and what                                we're actually doing with some of our                                real-life clients so we want to talk                                about ourselves and what we call                                authentic communication what what it is                                and why we should care                                basically present her contribution                                marketing canvas that you can use to                                build a marketing strategy communication                                strategy to encourage growth to drive                                contribution and so on in your open                                source project and your technical                                community what have you and then we'll                                quickly go over the contribution flows                                when all these things come together what                                what can have                                after having chatted with Lorna Jane                                last night a couple of things that we                                won't be talking about today so far are                                 things like talking about in a                                 sustainable engagement long term                                 contribution avoiding burnout and so on                                 we're focusing on the getting more                                 people in and getting them started                                 presenting with them with something that                                 makes it easier for them to be part of                                 it and contribute yes yes                                 take it away Tracy Evans okay so Jam as                                 you can see the practically lives on                                 stage me not so much I was having a                                 conversation earlier about this so I'm                                 far more nervous than he is so thank you                                 for your patience and understanding and                                 so what I'd like to tell you a little                                 bit about is you know basically in                                 developing any communication strategy                                 but especially one whose goals are                                 focused around contribution you'll want                                 to identify your audience define your                                 message and then communicate that                                 message and what we see is a particular                                 pattern which is easily to to recognize                                 in the open source that communication                                 drives connection connection drives                                 community and that community actually                                 creates a lot of business value and this                                 is also a virtuous circle so it's                                 virtuous in that existing communities                                 also create and strengthen connections                                 as they grow and thereby generate more                                 value and this is all underpinned by                                 what we call authentic communication and                                 so basically you know if you want to                                 break through the noise and connect with                                 open source contributors and developers                                 whose BS radars are particularly high                                 I've witnessed and I've seen some online                                 conversations that support this we need                                 to swap out the buzzwords and the                                 hyperbole for authentic communication                                 and what that looks like for us is doing                                 this by starting from a place of empathy                                 and it was super cool to talk watch the                                 talk earlier entirely about this topic                                 and it completely aligns with a lot of                                 what we were our views and what we were                                 talking about related to empathy so that                                 was that was pretty super cool                                 um but it's basically just being able to                                 put yourself in others shoes and to                                 understand their needs be trying before                                 trying to solve their problem and we                                 want to be as clear as possible in the                                 topics that we communicate using a                                 common language and clear and relevant                                 signals and we want to build trust by                                 avoiding as much marketing BS as we can                                 and also making sure that our arguments                                 make make logical sense and so authentic                                 communication needs to be both                                 compelling and accurate is it me--don't                                 one of the things that we're really                                 looking into is is cultural aspects of                                 communication and internal communication                                 as we build our organizations it's                                 actually just as important as outwards                                 facing external communication and                                 contribution and and community building                                 and so on is definitely important inside                                 of technology organizations and we've                                 been thinking a lot about DevOps and                                 breaking down silos and so on and                                 there's this some there's this very                                 common scenario where you have developer                                 teams and business teams and they're                                 just from different cultures they don't                                 understand each other they don't                                 understand each other's needs they have                                 even thought of each other's needs they                                 lack empathy potentially and that can                                 lead to poor communication which makes                                 it all worth so a culture right of                                 mistrust blame and lack of respect can                                 lead to slipped deadlines and shoddy                                 quality and demotivation and a lot of                                 turnover and and so you know language is                                 it can be a problem here you know if if                                 developers using jargon all the time                                 business person might not understand                                 that the business teams might be taking                                 actions without talking to the technical                                 people first they might be selling stuff                                 that you definitely have not built yet                                 right but it's you know the the the VC                                 right has put money in this and they                                 want to see that it matches a sorry but                                 it matches something it it's not a                                 solution looking for a problem right and                                 then the exact she's under pressure like                                 so she just went out and aggressively                                 found some customers and to make the VC                                 happy and now she's putting a lot of                                 pressure on on on the developer Dan                                 right and run for dam feels hard to put                                 upon and might just get out her resume                                 and go somewhere else too right                                 and then the execs have sold what turns                                 out to be a crappy product so the client                                 that they got is not gonna be an                                 advocate later they're gonna leave                                 disappointing to the whole thing                                 eventually is just gonna fall apart                                 right so you need to be inclusive you                                 need to use your empathy you need to use                                 different language right so that if                                 you're transparent about building your                                 culture if you get the different                                 stakeholders on two teams to talk about                                 what do you need where are we going how                                 can we do this you know for example you                                 might be able to come up with a solution                                 where you find an initial customer who                                 has the problem space that you're                                 looking at who's willing to be a guinea                                 pig at a discount right and every time                                 you deliver something on top of the                                 Minimum Viable Product every time you                                 fix a bug they were thrilled right every                                 time you give them something better and                                 better and better                                 you're winning them as a champion for                                 life the the your your source of money                                 sees that there's a real problem being                                 solved by what you're doing right                                 the developers maybe are gonna deliver                                 something is this still oh yeah so the                                 other person's gonna deliver something                                 that you know meets the minimum need                                 that they've been part of discussing                                 right and then they're gonna be happy                                 because they're you know your technical                                 expertise has been respected right so it                                 can be a virtuous circle if you ask                                 questions if you you know include                                 everyone when you're planning things so                                 this is this is what one aspect of                                 communication that I've now talked about                                 far far too long but thank you is the                                 most important phrase they're by the way                                 so when we talk about common language                                 yes we need it the we need to empathy to                                 build common goals for the organization                                 through inclusion and transparency and                                 we need clear communication with common                                 accurate language to connect rather than                                 divide and you know if you've started                                 from a place of empathy you'll                                 understand that the needs of your                                 business audience are not the same as                                 the needs of your technical audience and                                 your choice of language should reflect                                 that and I've I've experienced some of                                 these situations myself I was very                                 confused about what a function                                 and then we just used you know found                                 different words that resonate to me as a                                 business person that I understood what                                 the value was for me and you know some                                 some great examples are something like                                 WYSIWYG is a great technical audience                                 word but business-friendly authoring is                                 a great business term or highly                                 available file systems plus auto-scaling                                 container orchestration for technical                                 managers is a fabulous term but                                 consistently scaleable and highly                                 available is better for a business                                 audience and and sometimes a single                                 piece of content like a data sheet might                                 actually combine both the technical                                 description and the business value that                                 you get from that and can help clarify                                 for both sides I think you've got the                                 next one - oh no no I put that one on                                 use what was gratifying to see Francis                                 Frye recently do this TED talk it's it's                                 very very cool if you haven't seen it I                                 highly recommend it                                 we at open strategy partners have                                 developed this model of empathy clarity                                 and Trust in building our communications                                 it's really interesting that Francis                                 Frye then defines trust in her talk                                 about about rebuilding building and                                 rebuilding trust she defines trust as                                 logical rigor okay so you can't talk                                 nonsense to me you have to make sense or                                 I can't trust you authenticity if you're                                 not being yourself right if you're                                 selling something that you don't believe                                 in we're gonna see through you and then                                 the third pillar in her definition of                                 trust is that I have empathy to you so                                 which I feel ties nicely because that                                 circles right back to where we start                                 with empathy try and understand your                                 needs what you want to what you want to                                 learn how what we do can help so empathy                                 clarity trust backed up by logical rigor                                 authenticity back to empathy so so this                                 is so in our communication we're trying                                 to send out trust signals and you know                                 not sell vaporware try to be technically                                 accurate and especially in open source                                 land it's really really really important                                 to celebrate the communities that were                                 part of to highlight people's efforts                                 who've who've gone into building the                                 tools that that the                                 that we in business are selling we and                                 marketing or promoting than in that you                                 are using and also then improving as                                 contributors and so on right so trust                                 signals two examples of you know that                                 was some nice theory two quick examples                                 of how we at open strategy partners put                                 this into practice we use everything I                                 just said - for example define a                                 community and stakeholders who need to                                 know about your local development                                 environment product and go and conduct                                 stories find out you know who built it                                 and why they built it and what they were                                 doing and what the users are getting out                                 of it but like actually really talking                                 to these people and I can create expert                                 level content not being an expert if I                                 talk with you as an expert and I quote                                 you accurately right it's very very                                 powerful to actually ask questions right                                 then we create content we publish it we                                 promote it you know attract more people                                 to your thing and and so on so that's                                 sort of a workflow that we use and one                                 of one of our favorite examples of this                                 Heather put in an awful lot of work into                                 this we all contributed it one of our                                 clients is drug tech they make a really                                 neat tool if you work in PHP check it                                 out we created the brilliant sprint                                 guide so we are talking about                                 contribution at a meta level and their                                 tool enables contributions so we have an                                 open source how to run a great                                 contribution sprint guide that we                                 created in the name of our client and it                                 is also you know ready for pull requests                                 ready for you to use ready to go and                                 help you have better Sprint's and this                                 is marketing materials right so now this                                 is us doing marketing in the open source                                 space and hopefully well I can tell you                                 for sure that it's not right                                 it's incredibly practical and helpful if                                 you want to go and like then multiply                                 your own open source stuff that's what                                 we're about so yeah so so now we'll look                                 at ways that you can build a marketing                                 strategy to increase contribution which                                 is kind of what we promised in attending                                 here and so basically these are going to                                 be structures that should help you to                                 define your audience clarify your                                 message and                                 people come and contribute to your                                 project and so this is the model this is                                 contribution marketing canvas and I'm                                 sure you're all familiar with the                                 business model canvas buy strategize err                                 yes they do know business model canvas                                 okay well okay the for review well done                                 the rest of you it's it's pretty neat                                 it's pretty neat but we took our                                 inspiration for from the business model                                 canvas and reconstruct reconstructed it                                 for contribution marketing but we wanted                                 to think about the components obviously                                 very differently for this and so we                                 wanted to address you know what are your                                 contribution goals who's your target                                 audience what kind of signals put out a                                 sign of vibrancy and quality why should                                 they choose your project a project so                                 why what problem is it solving for them                                 and why they should particularly                                 contribute to your project when they                                 could be contributing to a thousands of                                 others and how they should contribute                                 contribute where to connect and what                                 stories to tell about it so the first                                 aspect of this is you need to figure out                                 what is it you actually need what what                                 what is it in attracting community

that this is                                 what maintaining an open-source app a                                 you know extension plugin like it's like                                 this every

                          why we might want contributors and so we                                 need to come up with some project                                 objectives where are we where are we                                 going what is it that are where are we                                 today and where does our project need to                                 be and what's missing to get there so we                                 might say oh well we want to deliver                                 tech and we want to grow adoption and                                 grow community and contribution okay so                                 those are our objectives here in this                                 fictitious use case retelling and we're                                 gonna dive into number three right and                                 we're gonna say okay growing community                                 and contribution concrete measurable                                 goals right I want                                                      next contribution sprint and the last                                 one and I want a new sponsor and I want                                 people to talk about what I'm doing in                                 public so those are the goals I want to                                 fulfill these of course will vary wildly                                 depending on what your project in your                                 situation are so now we've gotten to a                                 set of goals that were that we're                                 painting on to this to this market in                                 canvas and so in thinking about who                                 should contribute to your project you                                 know think about based on your goals and                                 the types of contribution that you need                                 who do you really want to attract to                                 contribute to your project is it des is                                 it only devs what about the writers what                                 about marketers what about social                                 scientists what about philosophy majors                                 and it just it's really helpful to just                                 take a step back and really think                                 intentionally about who would actually                                 provide a ton of value to contribute to                                 the activities that you want to have                                 done and it's also important to be clear                                 about who is meant to be part of your                                 community or event or initiative and                                 that doesn't need to be everybody it's                                 not if you                                 if you're targeted to everybody you're                                 not targeted to really anybody at all                                 but it should be clear that here you as                                 a business person you belong here you                                 belong in this room you belong at this                                 table or developer or marketer or or                                 whatnot also whatnots welcome so the                                 next thing is the term Heather actually                                 came up with one day in what we were                                 talking of I brron see signals you know                                 so so yeah if you go on github and you                                 see a project where the last commit was                                 in                                                                     channel they don't answer for some                                 number of hours or what-have-you right                                 we're also really really sensitive to if                                 we if this thing is if this thing is                                 still a thing right is it still alive is                                 it vibrant and there's a ton of ways                                 that we have a ton of signals depending                                 on the project to decide is this thing                                 really alive and are they doing a good                                 job of taking care of it and of their                                 can I just point out that I was so                                 excited and this was a completely                                 different perspective for me as a                                 marketer to look at that as important                                 signals to communicate and that was                                 something that was really cool that                                 Heather brought onboard when she started                                 with us to point out that that is very                                 much a part of the message that you're                                 communicating about your project yeah                                 it's great to it's great to be able to                                 put a name to this for us right and then                                 documentation and clear documentation is                                 is is certainly a part of this right you                                 want to tell people as clearly as                                 possible you know this is how we work                                 this is how we

hard to                                 set up whatever stack that thing runs on                                 it could be that you're actually new to                                 contribution you're really unfamiliar                                 with how pole requests work it might be                                 that if you're doing this in a context                                 at work it might be that you're using                                 open source stuff and this is an                                 entirely other talk that I give between                                 the the bosses in the and the bosses and                                 the developers like am I allowed to                                 contribute back upstream because you                                 know we're using all this stuff so                                 there's a companies who use open source                                 technology all over the place but have                                 no defined policies about contribution                                 and because I contend they don't                                 understand the value that they derive                                 from it ask me afterwards but so my                                 friend Christensen did an academic                                 research paper on open source                                 contribution and we've turned this into                                 a body of work together about the                                 business value of contribution so it's                                 really really typical to not know how to                                 contribute or just not have the time to                                 contribute or have doubts about yourself                                 or maybe you just don't know if you're                                 really really allowed to and those                                 things can all be made worse by the                                 embarrassment of a state having to ask a                                 colleague how to do something right or                                 the fact that it does take more of your                                 time or that you don't know what your                                 priorities are at work or that the scope                                 of your your activity at work is wrong                                 and just doesn't allow you to actually                                 go and fix the thing that's holding all                                 the team back right so these are real                                 blockers in in real organizations and                                 there are actions that you can take to                                 unblock them so we felt talking with our                                 client it dried that in general                                 contribution Sprint's are a great thing                                 and there was a gap to produce a great                                 guide on how to do them so in that                                 training and guidance enabler the green                                 things are enabler rights training and                                 guidance proficiency skill level you                                 know we contributed to making those                                 things better by showing how to do you                                 know how to set up a good sprint so                                 better communication teaching people how                                 to do it making time                                 contributing fixes to your definition of                                 done these are all great ways to enable                                 contribution and one more analogy from                                 Heather she says when you're trying to                                 explain your project documentation is a                                 map and tutorials are a travel book but                                 training is a guided tour so we have ten                                 minutes all right                                 okay so let's get into how to contribute                                 basically there's there are hundreds of                                 ways to contribute and but if you target                                 every type of contribution you'll again                                 be targeting nothing effectively so                                 looking at the project goals you need to                                 ask yourself in your team what are the                                 key areas and activities of contribution                                 that will help build the project                                 momentum towards its goals that it's                                 seeking and note here that contribution                                 is by is by no means limited to coding                                 activities right somehow we feel it's                                 important to set Lorna Jane is nodding                                 it's important to say this over and over                                 and over again Chris and I in our work                                 between the research and the interviews                                 that we did in our own experience we                                 determines what we thought were the                                                                                                   contribution code reviews are really                                 often overlooked and more people need                                 more code reviews because that blocks                                 that really blocks coding contribution                                 in general sponsorship always helps it                                 would be super cool if more people could                                 make more open source stuff pretty right                                 there's a hi nurse please help us um and                                 another thing you know evangelism is is                                 is quite well understood in some                                 contexts in software in certain ways but                                 marketing and marketing contributions                                 seem to have been overlooked in many                                 many cases and that's one of the things                                 that we're doing with our clients yeah                                 so yeah we we've noticed that marketing                                 seems to be an area that's often                                 overlooked when when they're thinking                                 about how to increase contribution and                                 we've been working with our clients to                                 help them help them increase things like                                 telling their story getting enabling the                                 community to write blog articles or                                 posting things on social media                                 or helping with the branding and the CI                                 and there's a lot more that we can do to                                 better enable these activities yeah and                                 write this so and there's one more                                 concept that kind of in how to                                 contribute and how to enable                                 contribution there's these it is it Dan                                 pink who talks about intrinsic                                 motivation yes master you're trying to                                 be purpose right so you can the better                                 your documentation is right the more you                                 enable people to be autonomous and the                                 more you automate quality control like                                 having a test suite in place and so on                                 the more you ought you can automate                                 mastery right all the bad code that                                 you've written you can regex for bad                                 patterns all the things that don't ever                                 pass your test suite if I put them in                                 because my coding I swear you don't want                                 it right                                 it helps me if I a new team member a new                                 community member whatever the more                                 automation the more quality controls                                 here the more mastery you're actually                                 transferring to the people who want to                                 help you out which in turn helps them                                 learn be more autonomous and so on and                                 if we've got a vibrant project that is                                 helping that person you know have a                                 better day at work and they're able to                                 give back of course this this this                                 generates community right and a sense of                                 purpose between us also so actually                                 documentation and automation are                                 incredible incredibly strong tools for                                 generating intrinsic motivation second                                 to last point here we're doing ok on                                 time oh yeah where to find people well                                 let's have a website right github and or                                 gitlab and whatever happens now social                                 coding and so on event participation                                 some of these things here typo                                       studies are really interesting case if                                 you can get people to talk in person                                 about the benefits that they're getting                                 from you it can create some real                                 connection and some real value and                                 sometimes a businessperson really really                                 needs to hear from another business                                 person                                 that this thing helped them right and                                 and if it's them talking they're the                                 people who have the money to pay us to                                 do our thing right so if we can get them                                 involved it can be it can be a really                                 really huge help so we define what our                                 project needs and what our specific                                 goals right now are in terms in today                                 and contribution and community growth                                 and we collect all these information                                 these bits of information through here                                 then we as content marketers when we're                                 thinking about content and our kind of                                 marketing activities we put them                                 together into narratives and stories and                                 yeah exactly so you know considering                                 what your goals are who you want to                                 attract why and how they should                                 contribute then you need to take that                                 information and ask yourself what                                 stories are important to tell what are                                 the narratives that are going to                                 illustrate your great technology what                                 are the narratives that will illustrate                                 a vibrant community and here's just a                                 couple of examples that we helped drug                                 build and this is this is actually                                 really really from our work and these                                 things flow into editorial plans                                 publishing activities making videos                                 conference sessions you know these are                                 themes that are actually important                                 exactly and then here's a few more that                                 we've been working on with with typo                                     tell their story and it's got a nice mix                                 of the technical value and oh yeah I                                 didn't mean to interrupt you okay I                                 apologize that's okay the type of three                                 story for us is really interesting we                                 have the commercial arm of the open                                 source CMS as a client the type of                                                                                                          Association which has allowed us to have                                 a really interesting expanded mandate so                                 we're thinking about their technology as                                 a whole and trying to grow adoption and                                 and and all of that stuff around the                                 tech but also how we can sell help sell                                 their products that help help your                                 agencies your job and so on like                                 extended support training junior                                 engineers selling SaaS working on the                                 you know the GDP our solutions for this                                 so there's a this product side of things                                 for us open-source products are really                                 fascinating to me um but at the same                                 time we're doing community marketing and                                 we're working we're helping with do PR                                 and an open-source contribution and then                                 we                                 we get into this I'm gonna cut slightly                                 ahead I think yeah well there's a                                 there's a really interesting point that                                 I wanted to get to where's there right                                 it was workshop slide no well it fits in                                 with the other oh it fits in there okay                                 too                                 so if you've put all this stuff together                                 we get to this thing that we're calling                                 the contribution flow state right now                                 you find if you if I if I get your                                 attention you see a tweet or something                                 right                                 Oh hmm other interesting client you                                 could be our clients talk to me                                 afterwards you know and you read a blog                                 post or you go to the website and you                                 it's like okay that's cool and right and                                 then you download it it's open source so                                 you can see the thing and you install it                                 and it helps you a little bit and that's                                 cool and then you know you have a                                 question and you go in the slack channel                                 and they answer it quickly it's like hey                                 this is alright and you look and then                                 people are contributing back to it and                                 there's been regular releases and it's                                 like now it supports all different                                 versions of Windows and it does you know                                 other things like wow that's a community                                 it's a life like actually this thing                                 that I need I'm gonna contribute that                                 too right so this is this map of we've                                 set up everything that we were just                                 talking about before so that it's ready                                 for that to happen everyone can find                                 their way in in you know in there really                                 naturally oh I see what you did there                                 sorry so and here's another concrete                                 example of this and so actually we do                                 get into a little bit of engagement that                                 Laura Jane was talking to you about                                 yesterday so basically after you know                                 once you have contribution you need to                                 support continuous involvement and                                 incrementally higher value involvement                                 and you know asking people to begin with                                 something small although not unimportant                                 like sharing other people's stories or                                 being interviewed for another person's                                 story it makes it easier to say yes when                                 it's a small ask and the incremental                                 asks then build trust along the way and                                 it also makes it easier to say yes to                                 higher levels of engagement because we                                 already feel invested and committed to                                 the cause so by the time I ask you to                                 write and publish a story you'll have                                 already you know been doing some of                                 those things like                                 sharing other people's stories are                                 contributing other people's stories and                                 you'll feel invested in the project and                                 want to see it succeed so you'll be that                                 much more motivated to spend the time in                                 writing a story yourself or yeah so a                                 concrete example of this is actually the                                 type of community writers program that                                 that Heather and I have designed and the                                 community needs more content and more                                 relevant content and they need to be                                 tighter in their communication so we're                                 going in and we're doing reasonably                                 regular online workshops here's how you                                 run an interview with someone's use as a                                 source for more material here's how you                                 write a case study here's how you so on                                 and so on and they're kind of they build                                 on each other and they're cyclical and                                 we can have regular contact with our                                 marketing team that way in this it's a                                 it's a pretty cool way of cat herding                                 right and it's totally acceptable if                                 it's six people or if it's you know                                    people the online format is low                                 investment for everyone low cost low                                 travel cost and so on so we're running                                 these regular community writers program                                 events now we've done one live community                                 marketing sprint but the marketing                                 Sprint's now the in-person sprints will                                 just be inflection points for a team                                 that works together regularly and                                 communicates regularly working up that                                 ladder from like retweeting the project                                 lead to publishing an interview and so                                 on and these skills right are also all                                 valuable for your agency the pre your                                 project the place you work like whatever                                 it is that you do besides typo                                     whatever it is all of these skills just                                 make us better contributors for                                 everything we're doing so this is                                 another excellent you know concrete                                 expression of the theories that we have                                 putting into practice to actually help                                 clients yeah and how we enable the rest                                 of the community to contribute in a                                 field that they may not have felt like                                 they were experts to begin with and part                                 of that workshop what at least the bits                                 that I've overheard is encouraging                                 people that they actually they do and                                 can have the skillset to contribute in                                 that way they don't need to have been a                                 marketer or a professional writer                                 everybody's got a story to tell                                 right and incredibly radically on time                                 we told you a little bit about ourselves                                 and what we call authentic communication                                 we talked about building up a structure                                 to to create communication artifacts to                                 prepare to be prepared to grow your                                 community and and and contributors and                                 some of the things that can result from                                 being that prepared we're not dealing                                 with the sustainability in the long term                                 engagement part so much or like the                                 specific tools of the trade or you know                                 choosing this you know tool over that                                 tool but some models to start with yes                                 so we got a lot of stuff from the                                 internet Thank You internet and thank                                 you for coming
