Title: #FOSSBack 18: The Document Foundation - Transparent & meritocratic future of free office software
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	The Document Foundation (TDF) is the charitable entity behind LibreOffice, the free office suite. It not only provides a legal framework for the project, but also manages assets and donations to support the further development of the software as well as the community. 

The organizational setup of TDF is rather unique - by having chosen a German "Stiftung", the community has opted for an entity that is recognized as strong, stable and enduring. Its statutes provide for independence of a single corporate sponsor, and at the same time focus on the core values of transparency, openness and meritocracy. 

In his talk, Florian Effenberger, Executive Director and one of the founders of The Document Foundation, gives an overview on how the foundation was set up, what goals it has achieved in the last six years of its existence and what plans and visions the community has for their future.
