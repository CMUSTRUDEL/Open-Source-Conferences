Title: #FOSSBack 18: The Document Foundation - Transparent & meritocratic future of free office software
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	The Document Foundation (TDF) is the charitable entity behind LibreOffice, the free office suite. It not only provides a legal framework for the project, but also manages assets and donations to support the further development of the software as well as the community. 

The organizational setup of TDF is rather unique - by having chosen a German "Stiftung", the community has opted for an entity that is recognized as strong, stable and enduring. Its statutes provide for independence of a single corporate sponsor, and at the same time focus on the core values of transparency, openness and meritocracy. 

In his talk, Florian Effenberger, Executive Director and one of the founders of The Document Foundation, gives an overview on how the foundation was set up, what goals it has achieved in the last six years of its existence and what plans and visions the community has for their future.

	                              so thank you very much and for joining                               and my title is quite a mouthful                               actually but it's on purpose as it                               already illustrates what I'm gonna talk                               about so you get to know what the                               document foundation is what we do how it                               relates to two LibreOffice and you see                               open transparent and meritocratic these                               are three core elements of what we do                                and in my talk I'd like to explain you                                what this means what is this about and                                how we achieved that so first of all a                                couple of words on to me so I've been in                                that free office space area and an open                                source per se for like I think                                      years I've been previously indeed but                                with open office work then join Libre                                Office from day zero was one of the                                cofounders of TDF and nowadays I work as                                its executive director should I find                                some spare time I'm involved a bit in                                infrastructure and marketing but my my                                day job is really working as executive                                director of TDF and does a task with                                handling our team our projects of                                budgeting all of those those kind of                                things but I've been heavily involved in                                the set up of TDF as well and like to                                share a bit what the ideas behind that                                were how we set it up and why we did say                                it did set up things in the way we in                                the end did so first of all on my                                opening slide you've seen this this big                                libreoffice logo and under need a                                smaller tagline the document foundation                                that's actually one part of the                                explanation already because the document                                foundation literally built the                                foundation on which libre office is                                built at libre office itself stands for                                not just one thing that stands for two                                things and one is software and one is                                the project so we do of course have                                Libre Office as a software that runs                                here on my machine it runs on your                                mobile it runs in the browser we see                                that a bit later and that is used by                                millions of users worldwide and at the                                same time it is the name of the project                                of the community of the people behind                                that driving that developing it                                marketing it                                translating it doing QA on it localizing                                it documenting it providing the                                infrastructure that's hundreds of if not                                thousands of contributors worldwide join                                the project working jointly on what we                                do and so that is the double meaning of                                Libre Office and the second thing that                                we do have is the document foundation                                that is the legal entity behind that it                                on purpose does not have to name Libre                                Office so if you look in our statutes                                you won't find the name Libre Office at                                all it's it's not mentioned there and                                that is precisely on purpose one reason                                is that of course at the beginning it                                was a tad unclear what the final product                                would be named and then ii see in a                                minute the idea behind the document                                foundation is to provide space for more                                projects in fact so that's how it was                                created and if you look at the statutes                                of TDF you find one sentence and that is                                the objective of the foundation is the                                promotion and development of office                                software available for use by anyone                                free of charge                                so you might see it's actually the                                translation of the official german                                statutes and we have quite known for                                having long and utter art sentences but                                there's a lot of that what we do in that                                so TDF itself first of all is a                                foundation or a stiff tone in german                                where he pasted here right in berlin but                                in fact if you look at our offices you                                won't find anything so we completely                                distributed across the world but it's                                really in in berlin is just our seat but                                nobody really is there so we'd be once                                had somebody passing by our office and I                                wanted to talk to someone was completely                                surprised they didn't find anyone to                                talk to                                so we really we need a legal seat but we                                are working from all of the world and so                                what is our mission a foundation is to                                see but later this is built on a on a                                 mission statement of donors will                                 and what does TDF do first of all and                                 I've highlighted here in in bold we do                                 promote what we do so that means we                                 support we spread the word we encourage                                 people to join we do marketing on that                                 and second we can also get active and                                 develop ourselves so those are two                                 important bits we can develop the                                 software and we can promote the software                                 and the ideals and the philosophy behind                                 that then the space that we cover is                                 office software so it's not just Libre                                 Office or not just a word processor but                                 it is office software and that is a term                                 that is a bit open to interpretation so                                 office software of course means the                                 office productivity software yes we have                                 it right now it could contain an email                                 client it maybe could contain software                                 for drawing but I'd say it could not                                 contain software for composers because                                 that is not office anymore but group                                 where on the other side could be in that                                 again                                 so office software is the space we cover                                 with the prime product that we have                                 being Libre Office of course and that's                                 that's that the scope we act the scope                                 within react and then important is for                                 use by anyone you see later that for                                 example contains that we do localized                                 product that we do document it in a lot                                 of languages because we would like as                                 many people as possible take part in it                                 use it contribute to it and that also                                 means reaching people whose prime                                 language is not English so anyone that's                                 in the statutes and then free of course                                 free software can also use it free of                                 charge so that's the disco within we act                                 and this is the mission statement the                                 foundation's objective that we do have                                 so to recap we have libre office the                                 software we have the community that is                                 acting worldwide and we have a                                 foundation that has a mission statement                                 that does not only cover Libre Office                                 but a broader range but within the                                 office space and the actual paragraph is                                 much lower so there is a mention of open                                 standards and so on but that's the frame                                 within react                                 and that is actually quite important to                                 tell you why so looking back at where                                 we've been coming from and to situation                                 we were in a couple of years ago there                                 were a lot of ideas that we already had                                 in the community that we lived by for                                 quite some time but did we wanted to                                 have secured and guaranteed and some of                                 these we put and anchored in the                                 statutes and that is of course as                                 mentioned we support the development but                                 equally the community and the product so                                 it's not just focused on a software and                                 it's not just focused on the project                                 it's actually both the way we do and we                                 do this on a variety of with a variety                                 of tasks like attending events giving                                 talks participating in trade shows the                                 mentoring developers on the other hand                                 doing marketing spreading the divert                                 about free software and open standards                                 so that is part of the philosophy that                                 we support development and that we                                 support that for both product and                                 community and there is no no preference                                 in the statute so both have in theory to                                 be fostered equally of course you ever                                 you have maybe a slightly different                                 focus per se PDF as entity has to                                 support motion then for us it was                                 extremely important to build something                                 that focuses on those ideals values that                                 we have been working with they never                                 have been really formalized it was just                                 principle that that we used to work                                 together and what we have done is that                                 we anchored those ideals that we                                 considered very crucial deeply down in                                 the statutes and statutes is something                                 that TDF is bound to so they are really                                 on a on a legal level bound and anchored                                 and written down and acknowledged by                                 everybody so it's really finding that                                 was important for us a third thing that                                 we were looking into is independence and                                 that part is sometimes a bit                                 misunderstood so it's not that we want                                 to be completely independent from                                 sponsors that's not what we want to be                                 and probably luckily our                                 to be independent from one single                                 sponsor so we do have corporate sponsors                                 it's a little bit later but the majority                                 of income indeed when when it comes to                                 money comes from individual donors and                                 we have around seventy thousand                                 individual donations per year apart from                                 the Sun this makes this is to Murad it                                 would sign because you have such a broad                                 user base people supporting our efforts                                 people donating smaller amount like                                 eight nine ten euro supporting us                                 worldwide and that is I think one very                                 important sign of very important                                 confirmation and that was one of the                                 goals to be independent from one single                                 sponsor but rather have a broad                                 supporter base what we aim for as well                                 is to provide an ecosystem so TDF itself                                 is not a participant in the market you                                 cannot buy anything from PDF we don't                                 provide support we don't provide paid                                 bug fixes that is something for an                                 ecosystem and that goes with the bullet                                 point above that we of course do need an                                 ecosystem we need people that actually                                 run a business model around that that's                                 that's absolutely fair enough that they                                 are all part of the community so we try                                 to foster the ecosystem to also have                                 corporate supporters in there and that                                 happens on a couple of air or in a                                 couple of areas one of these is                                 certification that's something we have                                 been fostering for the last three four                                 years that we do provide certification                                 for developers we do provide                                 certification for trainers and migration                                 experts and actually these are asked for                                 so we know for a couple for example of                                 tenders where a specific requirement has                                 been a certified libreoffice developer                                 so by that that's one of the means we                                 try to foster the commercial ecosystem                                 around that another philosophy was and                                 also looking back at our history to                                 lower entry barriers so I have to admit                                 I'm not a developer myself but from what                                 I've heard the code base especially in                                 the old days has been rather complicated                                 rather hard to get into and we wanted to                                 lower those entry barriers like in the                                 talks we've been given eight nine years                                 ago we always said we have many                                 in all areas of the project except for                                 development because it was so                                 complicated and so for us one of the key                                 items is to lower those entry barriers                                 we do that by easy hacks that is                                 identifying lower hanging fruits easy                                 ways into the code we do that by running                                 hackfest will participant in the google                                 Summer of Code we run workshops so                                 that's one of the means we get people in                                 we try to lower entry barriers make it                                 easier make it more friendly more                                 inviting to contribute and of course                                 we're not completely alone in the space                                 we do have lots of partnerships we work                                 with other organizations very proudly                                 and in the end how we describe TDF is                                 that is has been created by the                                 community with crowdfunding and with                                 collecting ideas for the statutes in the                                 set up and it is dedicated for the                                 entire community so that is the very                                 base philosophy behind CDF so how does                                 this look like that's its theory that's                                 what we want to have but how do we                                 manage that actually the first question                                 we often hear is and that's especially                                 for those who have bit more familiar                                 with the German law system so why did                                 you go for a system it's not the easiest                                 thing to set up and maybe not the most                                 prominent one you have associations                                 around space so why why a foundation                                 also here it goes back a lot to our                                 history what we wanted to have is first                                 of all something that is stable there                                 were lots of uncertainties and we didn't                                 know how things would look like and we                                 wanted to build something where at least                                 the the base parameters provide for                                 something that is stable and there is                                 the saying that foundations are built                                 for eternity of course not all of them                                 are but some of them are really really                                 old already and with the whole                                 onboarding process and creating a                                 foundation here at least in Germany and                                 I think it's similar for many other                                 countries it takes a huge amount of                                 effort and revenue and you really get                                 audited a lot whether the concept you                                 provide in the statutes or provide                                 really would work out so that's                                 something we wanted we wanted something                                 that is stable that                                 as the best parameters for being an                                 enduring entity very important for us                                 and that's the major difference to an                                 association is that the objective cannot                                 be changed so at least in plane theory                                 if you run a regular Association and all                                 your members want to change the                                 objective for example supporting free                                 software to supporting proprietary                                 software at least in theory it's                                 possible this has to be changed it has a                                 lot of implications it can be worked                                 around a bit by the statutes but in                                 theory it's possible because a                                 foundation is built on the donors will                                 expressed by the objective and the                                 statutes and an association by the                                 members will so that was very important                                 for us and as such TDF is some entity                                 that provides lots of safety because                                 everybody knows my contributions are                                 subject to those rules and those cannot                                 really be changed and we try to provide                                 that safety for the community for the                                 end-users and the commercial ecosystem                                 so really for everyone in that space we                                 want to provide that what do we do as a                                 legal entity like most legal entities we                                 don't have the big strategy decisions                                 ourselves that's up to the project what                                 TDF in its core tasks does is to act as                                 a sort of trustee so we hold funds we                                 hold trademarks we hold the main names                                 we read illegal entity we can sign                                 contracts that's I guess what what many                                 of the organizations do on their on the                                 base level and we do that for the                                 projects that are part of TDF so we we                                 do handle the donations as said we are                                 not part of the commercial ecosystem                                 ourselves so you cannot buy anything at                                 EDF that's what we have the commercial                                 ecosystem for but EDF aims to                                 guaranteeing rights for everybody who is                                 involved and that was very important for                                 us especially looking at history and the                                 back and forth and those those rules                                 that we stick to but that were not                                 really enforceable and we wanted                                 something where it's clear and where it                                 can be enforced so I taught a lot about                                 openness and about how we structured                                 philosophy so how actually are we set up                                 how do our bodies look like how is TDF                                 structured so first of all like many                                 organizations we do have a board of                                 directors that is simply the legal                                 representative of TDF and we have a I                                 think rather large board at least four                                 for German standards with seven seat                                 holders and three deputies they jump in                                 when seat holders are not available or                                 when they leave the board and they then                                 basically jump into that role I'm very                                 happy that we do have quite a good                                 mixture already of community members                                 that means from various countries that                                 arise backgrounds some of them making a                                 professional living out of Libre Office                                 others don't some of them really active                                 in various areas of the project we have                                 people more active and infrastructure                                 more active and development and the like                                 so we try to we aim for having                                 candidates who really cover many of the                                 areas that TDF and the LibreOffice                                 project work for and you see the list of                                 countries so that that's quite                                 impressive I'm especially happy for                                 Taiwan because those countries are                                 further away and having someone in the                                 board to represent them is quite                                 important I think so that's what we have                                 but how is the board elected how does                                 that work and that's the point where we                                 have basically invented something new                                 you could even say we kind of worked the                                 foundation model in a German law at                                 least because if you look online you                                 will be told that a foundation doesn't                                 have any members and the Association has                                 a foundation doesn't and we actually                                 have something in between we have in                                 English it's the Board of Trustees the                                 literal German translation would be the                                 Board of Trustees of members and so we                                 have some close to members element in                                 that and that's one of the key items                                 that we have quite proud of that we have                                 a model where anyone who contributes to                                 the good of the foundation to fulfilling                                 its mission whether it's in libreoffice                                 project or in other projects or in                                 foundation administrative work                                 that those people can when they have                                 contributed for the last three months                                 there is no no threshold they have to                                 read it must be some sensible                                 contribution but there is not an amount                                 of hours any hard limit that they then                                 can ask to be approved as a member of                                 TDF and that status is always granted on                                 an individual basis that means even if                                 you work for a company and you're paid                                 to develop for libre office or to                                 consult on libre office you personally                                 can apply to be a member and that                                 happens for one year and after one year                                 you can get the status again we can                                 reconfirm it if you don't contribute it                                 will not be a member anymore but you can                                 join any time again and the idea is                                 exactly this meritocracy that those                                 people who are active who contribute                                 whether it's pro bono whether it's                                 during the paint job that doesn't matter                                 that they can steer the ship and the                                 only thing that does not qualify is                                 donation so you cannot by yourself in                                 even if you donate a                                                     not automatically be approved as a                                 member the nations do not qualify but                                 really work that you invest time that                                 you invest now how are those members                                 selected because if the board would                                 select the members themselves could be a                                 rather closed circle the board appoints                                 the members the members they can elect                                 the board and they can be elected into                                 the board that's a problem so what we                                 have set up as well is a so-called                                 membership committee it's also an                                 official body of TDF and similar model                                 with                                                                    also run a term of two years or so here                                 re-election as possible the only                                 limitation that's maximum of                                            members can be in the membership                                 committee so that number is actually                                 flexible and that's exactly what they do                                 they approve new members they revoke                                 members if need be they see what has                                 been contributed whether they would                                 qualify for membership and same room                                 this board of trustees or the members                                 they elect the membership committee and                                 they can be elected under the membership                                 committee and we have some more checks                                 and balances the elections are mutually                                 overseen that means the membership                                 committee oversees two                                 what elections in the board of the                                 system Membership Committee elections                                 and then we have one more thing at EDF                                 that has the name board in it that's or                                 advisory board that is in contrast to                                 the Board of Trustees indeed dedicated                                 for companies and for organizations for                                 entities and although it's called board                                 it's not a formal body of TDF so their                                 role is to advise the board to give us                                 feedback so the idea is that indeed we                                 have those individual members but we                                 need feedback from the market we have                                 companies providing services providing                                 support and they of course have a                                 completely different scope and a much                                 better overview of their area and so we                                 wanted something where we would benefit                                 from where we would get inside and how                                 things work how the Board's decision pan                                 out for them how liberal is developing                                 per se and that's what the advisory                                 board is for so it's indeed dedicated to                                 companies and organizations it's not for                                 anybody else and they either have a                                 direct connection to Libre Office                                 because they provide service they                                 provide support or a long experience                                 would floss so they have experience they                                 can advise on general topics and that                                 per se is based on sponsorship so that's                                 one way for TDF of getting some                                 additional sponsoring currently we have                                                                                                          we have a quarter with the Advisory                                 Board where we share what we've been                                 doing or we show some statistics some                                 upcoming projects and ask for the                                 feedback and we prepare slides and those                                 slides departed that can be tacked on                                 confidentially a share with our members                                 and this is actually a rather important                                 thing because it pans to all TDF so TDF                                 is what i would describe public by                                 default that's also anchored in the                                 statutes what we have done is first of                                 all to apply a                                                          of                                                                  members of the Membership Committee can                                 have the same affiliation so you cannot                                 have board members all from the same com                                 honey because that would easily create a                                 conflict of interest that's in the                                 statutes and the statutes even foresee                                 that should people get elected in a way                                 that you have more than one thought they                                 can be removed they actually have to be                                 removed so that's hard in the statutes                                 that was important to us and then you                                 remember this the small title from the                                 beginning that openness and transparency                                 are key for us so public by default that                                 means per se all the board meetings are                                 in public the ceiling to the wiki page                                 where the minutes and decisions are                                 shown similar all decisions taken                                 outside of regular meetings for example                                 my email are public we even go a step                                 further and make the accounting public                                 so you get really nice ledges to see                                 where money comes from how it is spent                                 you can even see what's in the bank                                 account it's completely public and the                                 boards discussion mailing list is public                                 now of course there is a certain limit                                 to that because you don't want to make                                 the full legislature you see individual                                 names and what they have donated that's                                 not going to fly                                 of course we do have decisions in the                                 board that are limited that cannot be                                 made public or cannot be immediately                                 made public there are some things for                                 example but when it comes to contractors                                 that you rather don't want to make                                 public on the other hand if a new                                 advisory board member is showing up and                                 is talking to the board of getting                                 approved and the marketing is prepared                                 for that moment we don't make the                                 decision public because that would of                                 course you know dilute a bit the                                 marketing message but as soon as the                                 news is out the complete vote on that                                 and and who was in a meeting and when                                 the decision was taken is made public in                                 the statutes actually foresee that we                                 can take private decisions but as soon                                 as they confidentially is not there                                 anymore they have to be made public                                 afterwards so you will every once in a                                 while see some decisions made public                                 that have been taken before because                                 that's actually in accordance with the                                 statutes that's mandated and enforced by                                 the statutes so by that we try to make                                 things as public as possible to the                                 extent that is possible                                 keeping in mind certain limitations may                                 exist for example privacy reasons but                                 per se everything at TDF is power                                 so where do we stand with that what what                                 have we achieved so far were disinterred                                 he of course we do have libre office and                                 I'm not gonna tell you in detail what it                                 is because I assumed everybody knows but                                 you see two things in there that relate                                 actually to the statutes supporting                                 multiple platforms is within the light                                 of we want to reach as many people as                                 possible available for use by anyone                                 free of charge                                 the second thing here more than a                                 hundred languages that's the same goal                                 we want to reach out and make the                                 software the documentation the help                                 system the websites and so on available                                 in as many languages as possible in                                 order to reach as many people as                                 possible and that is with the with the                                 keyword of digital participation so we                                 want to include those people and there                                 are numerous countries and I think those                                 of you active and open-source projects                                 will know that that won't really speak                                 English that well that's not their their                                 mother tongue and it's not really the                                 language to learn at school so the                                 assumption that everybody to some degree                                 speaks English is for many countries                                 completely wrong for example from Brazil                                 I've learned many of the younger                                 generation do but the older they don't                                 it's it's simply not their language so                                 we try to aim although English is the                                 common denominator that we have to speak                                 because most people do that actually we                                 try to have as wide as outreach as                                 possible and localize in as many                                 languages as possible in line with the                                 statutes that what we do should be                                 usable by by as many people as possible                                 and what we do is that we have two major                                 releases per years we run at a                                 time-based release that actually is not                                 in the statute it's just a matter of                                 fact and so on and so on so that's                                 that's the primary thing you see from                                 CDF                                 what's rather new and that's something                                 done primarily by the commercial                                 ecosystem around is the libreoffice                                 online so a version a set of packages to                                 deploy to run libreoffice in your local                                 browser if you have any any recent any                                 modern browser you can run it you can                                 broken documents it uses existing share                                 and authentication systems to make the                                 user management to store the data it                                 provides multiple users to edit so you                                 can use collaborative editing the                                 important thing that we planned from the                                 beginning is that the same rendering is                                 used than the desk abrasion so your                                 document should ideally look the very                                 same because the same rendering engine                                 is behind that and that is indeed                                 primarily driven by one of the                                 commercial ecosystem participants and of                                 course in light of free software with                                 the source code made available in public                                 would you see here below is the link for                                 the docker container where you can                                 download all that and see for testing                                 purposes and that's radda radda new and                                 primarily targeted for the enterprise                                 market of course but it's something                                 within the libre office ecosystem that                                 has been released and I think quite                                 quite well and quite a while ago already                                 we published a viewer for Android where                                 can view documents and that already                                 features at least an experimental                                 editing mode so that's all the effort of                                 this disc elaborated working we are the                                 bound to one more thing that came to                                 life over the course of TDF and i think                                 in                                                                  liberation project the similarity of the                                 logo is not a coincidence so the                                 document liberation project was                                 something that primarily existed already                                 in libre office we had lots of filters                                 and then they were basically thought                                 into a separate package and                                 the main goal is that also in life with                                 the statutes with access to your                                 documents open data open standards that                                 old proprietary formats mainly from old                                 software that is not on the market                                 anymore and legacy file formats that you                                 can report them that you can open them                                 in LibreOffice and convert things                                 convert things to the open document                                 format so it provides one means                                 especially for legacy documents to be                                 converted into all the oven essentially                                 gives you access to your documents to                                 your data and convert it into an open                                 standard and that has indeed been made                                 primarily by volunteers they have been                                 working on that they have the idea of                                 putting it into a separate package and                                 not only in the Liebherr of the source                                 code and that is an official TDF project                                 that is not so much visible to the                                 outside because it's more developer                                 centric less and user centric and what                                 makes us quite proudest this library is                                 used by many other open source projects                                 so it turned into a combined effort                                 completely in light of TDF submission                                 PDFs goals TDF statutes and that's I                                 think a very good sign so one project                                 that completely was created out of what                                 we had was put in a separate project                                 called document Liberation project                                 there's much more and if you're eager to                                 see in an all area speed budget be legal                                 bid events be a development website                                 infrastructure we do have a really nice                                 and a report that is around                                             and per se that was a legal obligation                                 that we had at being a foundation the                                 authorities asked please once a year                                 send us what you've been doing so we see                                 you actually do something and we turned                                 that legal obligation into a benefit by                                 not just providing the mandatory German                                 version to the authorities here in                                 Berlin but rather getting it translated                                 getting input in a in a nice layout at                                 version getting it printed illustrated                                 with graphics with pictures and it gives                                 a perfect over youm for us it's each                                 year amazing                                 because several countries especially                                 those who have problems with speaking                                 English they're not interacting                                 regularly with with tvf english-speaking                                 TDF so at least once a year you ask                                 people what have you been doing what is                                 going on in your region                                 what are you suffering from what                                 successes did you made and they give you                                 that feedback and for that that's quite                                 touching each year to read that what is                                 going on what all those communities are                                 running and we do have both versions                                 available for download and the                                      version is scheduled later this quarter                                 so we are in the finalizing bits of the                                 layout in process and then you get                                 information on what we have done the                                 past year and the plans for the next                                 year are vast and probably most hard                                 part is what is the future like and it's                                 hard to answer that there is no big road                                 map that we have like for the next                                    years with what deadlines and such it's                                 more based on meritocracy that you                                 decide so if you join TDF if you join                                 our effort speed as a member or a                                 regular community member that is not a                                 Board of Trustee that doesn't make so                                 much difference in that regard you can                                 decide you can steer the ship so of                                 course there are some ideas there are                                 some plans but there is no officially                                 TDF roadmap because we're an open-source                                 project and we have people contributing                                 and they should decide where are things                                 heading just a couple of things that                                 recently took place on rice bits in the                                 project is first of all the Membership                                 Committee that I've mentioned is due for                                 reelection this summer they will be in                                 charge I think in September October so                                 that will start soon if your member of                                 TDF consider running for a seat then we                                 have recently published the results of                                 one of the tenders that were funded by                                 TDF in terms of accessibility and a new                                 hub system is place since libre office                                                                                                      more modern way in the browser and if                                 I'm not mistaken with Libre Office                                     from this HTML help there will also be                                 an offline version so that's complete                                 change in the approach for the help                                 system                                 we will have our annual gathering the                                 conference in Tirana this year and                                 September definitely recommend going                                 there it's it's an amazing event and of                                 course

       we do have a dedicated forum for that or                                 send an email to the board discuss list                                 or to the info address send any proposal

a bit                                 now that I've talked a lot about TDF and                                 how we are set up and how did the                                 philosophy behind that and what the                                 statutes foresee just invitation to join                                 us so this is a group picture that we                                 had at the annual conference in Brno one                                 and a half years ago and it's like in                                 many open-source project it's just just                                 fun it's really incredible having people                                 and friends around the world and working                                 together and jointly completely                                 independent from what people do for a                                 living or what the professional                                 background is what age they are that is                                 really completely overcoming all those                                 artificial artificial borders that we're                                 seeing so I definitely can recommend                                 joining and because I said Esther the                                 group picture we had in Brno and the                                 next conference will be in Albania I've                                 been there just three weeks ago and                                 really lovely place it's not the nearest                                 spot to flyby but it's definitely worth                                 the trip and I'm pretty sure the                                 conference will be quite exciting as                                 well and with that I hope we're quite                                 good on time if I'm not mistaken yeah it                                 looks good so if you have any questions                                 either here or by email I'm around for                                 the rest of the day well firstly maybe                                 you think Florian and I will come for                                 questions                                 [Applause]                                 with regard to your statutes                                 did you write anything about open                                 licenses in it I didn't catch anything                                 there and one of the reasons I asked is                                 that California at the moment is looking                                 at writing a proposal for a voting                                 software to be a free and open source                                 and it's very difficult to write robust                                 future-looking definitions for open                                 source in the statute                                 so to recap I think the question was                                 what do we have anything with regards to                                 licenses in the statute so we do not                                 mention explicitly one license but there                                 is I think really more for sentence will                                 be described what free Libre and open                                 source software is we basically covered                                 all the terms that open standards matter                                 so we described the licenses that could                                 regard that's a description that we give                                 but there is no concrete license                                 mentioned so we do have some flexibility                                 especially with regards to you can                                 hardly change what's in there but it                                 must be freely broadband source software                                 open standards so the description is                                 quite extensive and if you go to a                                 website we do have both the determine                                 version as well as a translated English                                 version online so I think that the first                                 one or two pages are really describing                                 all that we do in will without                                 explicitly mentioning a license or a                                 product but still setting the frame with                                 him so we are forced to stay within an                                 open license indeed do we have more                                 questions as far as I have heard this                                 initiative came from the former star                                 office folks in Hamburg to create this                                 foundation it is true and as I have seen                                 now people that contribute are from all                                 over the world I is there any special                                 German group there are anymore in the                                 foundation already spread completely so                                 the question was what a first of all                                 it's true that the initiative for TDF                                 came primarily from former some                                 employees and where there was a special                                 focus on Germany with regards to people                                 active so the initiative came from a                                 variety of people it was it was not                                 really spoken out but we have been                                 working in this project for four ages                                 already and when we had that the last                                 official Open Office or conference it                                 was really like in every corner you                                 could hear foundation foundation                                 relations people had the same idea but                                 it was really a completely mixed group                                 would put many many volunteers and many                                 more volunteers join in the first days                                 so did the answer to that but it's                                 primarily from former employees is a                                 clear no it was group effort indeed                                 primarily driven obviously from from the                                 volunteers because they were in a                                 different position and of course and                                 what we got to Germany there is still we                                 do have many of the former people                                 working on the OpenOffice or code base                                 now with other companies still working                                 for liberal office and they historically                                 have been primarily in Hamburg and of                                 course there's a certain focus when it                                 comes to administrative bits as they are                                 in German obviously but otherwise we                                 really completely distributed so there                                 is we try to keep that focus as as small                                 as possible because we don't see us as a                                 German foundation that the seed is                                 completely independent so it's we have                                 to have a local seed and as a foundation                                 we can't leave Berlin that's a specialty                                 of the regulations but in the end I'd                                 say we're virtual so there there is a                                 seed but anything else happens online                                 and it's not really tied to a specific                                 country or city so thank you Florian                                 again and we will meet at                                              planned please have lunch right now                                 thanks a lot to enjoy a meal                                 you
