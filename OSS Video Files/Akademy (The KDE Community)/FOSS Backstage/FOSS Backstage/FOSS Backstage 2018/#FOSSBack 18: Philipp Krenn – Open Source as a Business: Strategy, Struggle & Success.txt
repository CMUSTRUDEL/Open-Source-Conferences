Title: #FOSSBack 18: Philipp Krenn â€“ Open Source as a Business: Strategy, Struggle & Success
Publication date: 2018-06-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	How do you build a lasting and successful company that also stays true to its open source roots? This talk takes a look at why open source is important to business and three essential elements of this path:

- Strategy: How can you monetize your open source product? Is it support, an open core approach, cloud services, or a combination of the three? And which ones are the features you can even commercialize without alienating your community?
- Struggle: "You received a 100 million dollars in venture capital and yet you have so many open issues?!" Once money is involved the dynamics often change. How can you manage expectations and still build on a flourishing open source community?
- Success: How do you balance open source and commercial success? How do you align engineering and sales decisions?

This talk takes the perspective of Elastic, the company behind the open source products Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash, which makes its money with support, the commercial X-Pack extensions, and cloud offerings. But we are also taking a look at how others are approaching this challenge, what worked, and what failed.

	                              thank you good morning and so this talk                               is kind of combined with the slot                               afterwards so I will do a talk to kind                               of kick off the idea and afterwards                               there is a discussion and so I won't do                               any questions at the end and I would                               probably fill out the entire slot but                               the discussion and everything will                               happen right afterwards so don't run off                                afterwards so I want to talk a bit about                                business and struggle and things that                                probably look like this                                everybody wants well-maintained                                open-source software few people want to                                contribute and nobody wants to maintain                                basically and this is kind of a common                                thing I guess most of you have seen or                                experienced in one way or another and                                there are also people who say that the                                majority of their code for example here                                from puppet was contributed by somebody                                they actually paid because well doing                                open source in your free time works for                                some projects but not for everything and                                sometimes you want to have a company to                                sponsor and push stuff forward so I                                think open-source is kind of like an                                advantage for every thing around doing a                                software project except for making money                                there commercial software is probably                                better off every for everything else                                it's probably the other way around why                                am I talking about that well I work for                                elastic I'm developer advocate or                                whatever you call us I mostly talk about                                the stuff that we do in struggle that we                                have there and we have I guess most of                                you know our open-source products so                                these are the things that we put out in                                the open but we need to make money                                somehow in somewhere and the common                                question is where is the money like                                where can you get the money from and we                                were kind of largest now we were getting                                close to                                                                                                                                        money you need to make it's not just                                donations you can take in anymore so the                                first thing that I guess a lot of us try                                to do our services so you have support                                consulting training certification                                anything around that canonical for                                Ubuntu is doing that redhead obviously                                for anything they do is they're doing                                that and reddit is amazingly successful                                with that every                                please seen their revenue growth and                                that's a pretty impressive number for                                quarterly growth like they have been                                very consistently been working on that                                just by providing support so you might                                think this is very easy and we'll just                                do the same thing we'll offer support                                and life will be great right the problem                                is it's not that easy first thing is if                                your product is very easy to use why                                should I pay you and and then you have                                this bad incentive to make your product                                not easy to use so you can sell support                                and that's probably not a place where                                you want to be that you kind of like the                                success of your company belongs on                                having and not that easy to use product                                probably don't do that the other thing                                that you often see is that renewal rates                                are not that great                                because well people figure out how to                                use your software first they pay support                                after two or three years they evaluate                                and say like well we didn't have any                                major incidents we didn't need your                                support really we know the product now                                why should we still pay you X amount of                                money we'll just skip the support                                contract and like renewal rates are                                often bad like                                                       that's also not very sustainable like as                                soon as you have a mature user base they                                probably don't want to pay you anymore                                and then you have companies trying to do                                consulting but the problem is if you do                                consulting you will be competing with                                all the only consulting companies and                                you will probably be always more                                expensive than those because you spent I                                don't know                                                         percent developing your own software                                whereas somebody else can spend hundred                                percent consulting they might not know                                 as much but they are probably like a                                 third or half of the cheaper or the                                 price of what you offer and a lot of                                 companies will just take those who are                                 much cheaper and that's also not a great                                 place to be the next thing that a lot of                                 companies do is and I'm probably                                 conflating multiple things here you have                                 some open source offering but then you                                 have some commercial extensions or                                 plugins or whatever around it I just say                                 open core I think my sequel was that the                                 most prominent one with the do your line                                 sent with the GPL and if you wanted to                                 do anything else with the source code                                 you had to pay for it now they also have                                 some commercial features you only get                                 when you pay                                 the ecosystem is kind of very strong in                                 there I'll test I've put in mapper but                                 it probably applies to Claude Aaron to                                 Horton works in a similar fashion did                                 you have something as a core basis on                                 open source technology and then you have                                 some other commercial extensions around                                 them and you might think well this is                                 very easy I'll just do that the problem                                 is it doesn't solve all the problems                                 sometimes it's some somebody else will                                 try to monetize on your hard work which                                 looks something like this one thing is                                 what do you commercialize oftentimes                                 it's something about security or scaling                                 or operating your software the problem                                 is some competitor could just come in                                 and say like oh we'll just provide the                                 monitoring for your solution or make it                                 easy to run that and while you're                                 spending your time building your product                                 somebody else will just compete with you                                 only on the commercial things and this                                 kind of load was a bit of a                                 disappearance also if you want to run                                 something because of the cloud providers                                 they will just take that business away                                 from you probably as well because well                                 running MapReduce used to be very hard                                 now you can just spin it off on up on                                 AWS so I don't need to buy any tooling                                 around it anymore because AWS has                                 automated that part away from me yeah so                                 generally cloud providers are eating                                 into that and provide good solutions for                                 the end-user maybe not great solutions                                 for the open source project and the                                 final thing that a lot of people are                                 kind of wary of is locking that once I                                 am on your commercial products I cannot                                 use anything else for example for                                 Cassandra and data stacks if I remember                                 correctly if you're using the data text                                 version if you want to go back to the                                 open source Cassandra version you                                 actually need to dump out your data and                                 re-import it because the storage format                                 is somewhat different so there is this                                 lock in if you have lots of data that                                 will hurt you                                 the final thing where people try to make                                 money is cloud services of course to                                 companies that I think doing that very                                 successfully one of them is WordPress if                                 you go to wordpress.org you got their                                 good or whatever CMS we could discuss                                 about that if you go to wordpress.com                                 you will get it as a service and you                                 don't need to care about anything and                                 they have their own extensions then to                                 make that run better there                                 one that is also doing pretty well it's                                 entry everything is open-source they do                                 accept for their billing module and you                                 can either run it yourself or you can                                 just say like it's not worth the hassle                                 it's cheap enough I would just use their                                 service the problem once again is                                 somebody might basically eat your lunch                                 which well could look something like                                 this                                 and once again this might be cloud                                 providers for example because well you                                 have this nice shiny Apache BSD whatever                                 license product everybody wants to use                                 that I will just provide it as a service                                 for the customers and they are totally                                 entitled to do that or they can legally                                 do that but it doesn't make it very may                                 be ethical is the wrong word but it                                 doesn't make it right or it doesn't help                                 the open-source product in the end                                 yeah I like this quote open-source                                 software was not so that someone else                                 can take the exact same software and all                                 failure as a service because yeah that                                 is what oftentimes happens somebody else                                 is basically making money of what you                                 were building and probably not                                 contributing back so that is one of the                                 challenges you have how to circumvent at                                 MongoDB did that quite well they are a                                 GPL licensed and I think that's one of                                 the reasons why for example there were                                 very few cloud services that offered                                 Amazon                                 sorry not Amazon but MongoDB as a                                 service for example Amazon did not                                 provide MongoDB as a service and they're                                 providing lots of other data stores as a                                 service but not MongoDB and they were                                 very late to the game they have now                                 their own cloud offering which is called                                 Atlas but they only started at like two                                 years ago or so nobody wanted to touch                                 that so that might sound like a good bet                                 but it might also not be um who knows                                 that logo anybody in the Microsoft the                                 ecosystem that's cosmos DP they're                                 highly I don't know I've hyped or they                                 are trying to push that a lot it has                                 multiple models it can do lots of things                                 can do relational graph it came store                                 documents and what they have done is                                 they've basically taken the API said                                 MongoDB is providing and then you can                                 just interact with those api's and                                 they've basically replaced MongoDB so                                 that is in my opinion                                 worse place to be in basically because                                 of the a GPL license nobody wants to use                                 your software but people want to use the                                 wire protocol                                 so you just reimplemented wire protocol                                 but you get rid of the original vendor                                 and that puts you I think in a much                                 worse position than if you're cause                                 somebody is using your software as a                                 service it's still yours and you can                                 still steer it okay so how do you                                 continue with the struggle yeah they're                                 always kind of devout just looking out                                 for victims to use somebody's software                                 and profit out of that I don't want to                                 bash Microsoft here in general but yeah                                 if somebody sounds like already's and                                 you think ah you mean aja Reddy's cash                                 that will not make the creators of red                                 is very happy if people don't even know                                 the project anymore and just think well                                 it's an SEO service and that is what I'm                                 using and they don't care about the                                 original open-source product anymore                                 yeah and the other thing that is                                 probably important is if you say you're                                 doing open source stuff you should                                 contribute back upstream otherwise                                 you're just using stuff and well we we                                 have the two that other products build                                 on top of us and build a thin layer of                                 something on top of us and there is                                 nothing coming back and that doesn't                                 make us very happy as an open source                                 project either okay next thing that                                 might be a problem our users I guess                                 everybody has to have their experiences                                 my one of my examples is we had this                                 post some time ago on our discuss forums                                 that somebody complained that the Ruby                                 and rails integration we were doing is                                 abandoned and not good and they were                                 mightily complaining what is the obvious                                 question that you're asking them maybe                                 you want to maintain something and the                                 answer is of course not                                 that is I guess most of you have seen                                 something like that already but yeah                                 whenever we see that we're like okay                                 great and yeah this is the homebrew                                 author you're entitled to your immediate                                 refund of zero and if you're not happy                                 with an open-source product and and that                                 is how you should view that we did have                                 a lengthy argument                                 dr. Chang jumped in as well and then                                 there's always this nice argument well                                 this company got I don't know that much                                 money in funding                                 why should I do work for free for them                                 and that's also another problem that                                 kind of like once somebody got money                                 kind of the incentives are different and                                 people have a different view on that                                 which I don't think makes this right                                 this behavior but yes some people just                                 say like why should I do anything I just                                 want free stuff and do it and yeah could                                 that argue like it is really dead or not                                 you can see this was how this Ruby                                 driver was developing and I think it's                                 maybe a bit sleepy but it's it's still                                 working and it's doing the right thing                                 but we decided we want to hire one more                                 maintainer to do that and we have a new                                 colleague                                 I think she's called Emily she's even                                 based in Berlin and she will maintain                                 that now and put more effort into that                                 so for that we decided to actually do                                 that and take the complaint seriously                                 and try to help out the community but                                 it's not always the case and I've had                                 that with other open-source products as                                 well where stuff just is like it's too                                 much scope you cannot cover everything                                 for example MongoDB has this Java ORM or                                 they call it ODM object document mapping                                 called morphia and you can totally see                                 this is how it this has been developing                                 over the past few years so every now and                                 then somebody is doing something and                                 then it's kind of dead and then somebody                                 decides okay we need to do something and                                 then it's kind of dead again and with                                 you I think it's kind of dead for good                                 now but I'm not sure I used that at my                                 previous company and I think they are                                 now finally biting the bullet and trying                                 to migrate away but this is stuff that                                 happens even if you have a big company                                 and you have lots of money there's so                                 much ground to cover you cannot cover                                 everything so hopefully somebody from                                 the community will step up okay and then                                 there's always the business side venture                                 capital is nice if you want to have this                                 accelerated development and you want to                                 have like okay I want to hire                                        people to work on all these things the                                 problem is it also changes the entire                                 dynamics so where is the toxic problem                                 or where's the issue first off                                 it's very hard to find this sweet spot                                 about having a proper open source                                 product that is usable on its own and                                 not starving the company and that the                                 two examples that I have here are in                                 flexi B we have this internal joke we                                 always call it to pull an influx is when                                 they put every scaling they hat point                                 into their commercial offering and all                                 high availability and scaling and influx                                 is not open source anymore which kind of                                 narrowed their use case a lot the other                                 thing is reading TP which was widely                                 loved and everybody wanted to use that                                 and said well this is a great product                                 but it didn't find a good use case or                                 monetize way to monetize it and they                                 went bankrupt and are pretty much dead I                                 think if the code is open and has been                                 put into the Linux Foundation but there                                 has not been any major development for                                 more than a year so this is pretty much                                 dead so this also doesn't help anybody                                 if your product ends up like this and                                 the final one is probably talker they                                 are not there yet but probably at some                                 point all the venture capital will run                                 out and I don't see any good business                                 there we'll see okay the other thing is                                 how do you release stuff do you have                                 multiple products or do you have                                 proprietary plugins so for example data                                 sects they have basically taken over and                                 have a different version which is called                                 data sticks I don't know if they even                                 call themselves Cassandra anymore but                                 that's a very different product in                                 Apache Cassandra and they will also bash                                 the Petra Cassandra and say like oh our                                 software is three or five or whatever                                 times faster than the the open source                                 one QT for example they have plugins to                                 plug in to their software and yeah and                                 then you have this discussion open                                 source versus open code where you do you                                 put the code that you where you need a                                 commercial license to use it but maybe                                 it can be viewable and the two projects                                 which I've seen which are doing that get                                 lap you can see their commercial code                                 get lap EE but you need a commercial                                 license to use so then it's a separate                                 package cockroach labs which has this                                 relational database that is not you                                 cannot kill that's why they're called                                 cockroach I think they have it in the                                 same repository but you need a                                 commercial license to use some of the                                 features that they have in there yeah                                 and then you                                 always have to fight like engineering                                 wants to put everything into open-source                                 and sales wants to put everything into                                 the commercial license but there's                                 probably no way around that this would                                 be an ongoing discussion that you always                                 need to have so what are we doing we                                 always say we have this elastic heart                                 which is the open source heart that we                                 have we have an open source version we                                 have a free version that no other cloud                                 provider can use this is kind of a bit                                 of a protection account it's the other                                 cloud providers and we have commercial                                 plugins then and these are put together                                 into we call off that all of our                                 commercial plugins expec and they're                                 always going hand with hand with support                                 because otherwise we've seen that the                                 retention rate of support is pretty bad                                 and once you're using the commercial                                 plugins the retention rates for support                                 are much better and then we don't need                                 to make our products harder to use or                                 kind of bad documentation or anything to                                 keep people to pay support we have                                 opened the code now and everything is in                                 one repository we have like a patch to                                 license and our own commercial license                                 so you for some features you will need                                 to have a commercial license so by now                                 we have everything in one repository                                 everything is Apache - licensed only one                                 folder has the expec code where you will                                 need a commercial license to actually                                 use that which pretty much looks like                                 this you have this open source space                                 then you have expect on top of it which                                 is split into free and paid features but                                 everything lives in the same repository                                 and you can see what is going on we do                                 have training and consulting but that's                                 kind of like very small and doesn't                                 scale much we do try to offer our                                 service as a cloud on various cloud                                 providers we do also have some                                 orchestration thing on-premise or in                                 your own cloud account so it's basically                                 kubernetes plus more to orchestrate your                                 services in your own accounts and we                                 even sell swag so if you want to buy                                 anything                                 we even have elastic dot shop and we try                                 to make a little bit of money out of                                 everything work that we can basically                                 just to keep the open-source going so to                                 wrap up I don't want to give the                                 impression that business is mandatory                                 business is optional there are some very                                 successful open-source products which                                 are not super Mershon in the background                                 and are going very well I guess both                                 is the one that everybody knows and the                                 other one is and that's a very                                 interesting blog post about envoi which                                 is yeah this new thing around in the                                 orchestration space and they actually                                 decided well it came out of which                                 company is that I think lift if I'm not                                 mistaken but lots of others are                                 contributing now and they had this point                                 where they were like okay should we try                                 to build a product out of this but Matt                                 who is was the original author was like                                 no it's not really what I want to do and                                 we want to keep this open source it's                                 intentionally not going to be a product                                 or a company and it's going very well                                 for them the other thing is business is                                 complicated and for us this looks                                 something like this like this here is                                 the open source part these are the paid                                 features with go hand-in-hand with                                 support this is what we try to do as a                                 cloud offering but it is not easy and                                 you need probably to have multiple                                 strategies if one of them fails to have                                 like some other way and like combine all                                 the money to keep the company afloat                                 I guess we'll skip the questions and                                 we're pretty much out of time and we'll                                 hand over to the discussion afterwards                                 I'll stick around for the discussion so                                 if anything is in your in the question                                 space I will be there as well we're good                                 time wasn't everything we will continue                                 in Iran first of all Thank You Philip my                                 pleasure thank you                                 you
