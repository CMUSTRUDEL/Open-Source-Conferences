The first external person contributing to our project is amazing, but when that 1 snowballs to 1,000 life can get a little bit stressful. All of these fine lovely people want to help, but somehow no one seems to want to deal with code reviews, proposed documentation changes, or keeping your testing infrastructure alive, or maybe they just want to pull in different directions.

This talk explores what happens as a community grows and provides recommendations to organize your community. We’ll focus on how to control the fun chaos and how to build a development path that keeps your comitters engaged and your community growing. All of these are based on the speakers’ experiences in their own personal projects (which have much less than 1k contributors) as well as larger projects, like Apache Spark.

Come for the being told it’s not your fault, stay for the techniques to avoid pissing everyone off.

	                              so yeah my name is Holden my preferred                               pronouns are shear her and it's tattooed                               on my wrist in case you or I forget                               morning's can be a little rough                               sometimes and I'm a developer advocate                               at Google which is nice they pay me                               money I work on open source software                               yeah it's fun                               I'm on the spark PMC which is where a                                lot of this experience draws from but I                                also contribute to other projects and                                I'm on a few other PMC's and I also work                                on a lot of smaller projects that you                                probably have not heard of very hipster                                and I've been at a bunch of other                                companies                                besides Google I'm a co-author of two                                books they are completely unrelated to                                today's talk but that should not stop                                you from buying them in fact the second                                one is the first book where I realized                                you could negotiate contracts so that is                                definitely the book that you should buy                                because I got a much better deal once I                                learned you could ask for things anyways                                and you can follow me on Twitter and                                I've started doing code review live                                streams as well and spark which I will                                talk more about as well in addition to I                                am professionally I'm trans queer                                Canadian I live in America on a work                                visa which the kind of work needs that I                                have they are currently debating as to                                whether or not they wish to keep it and                                that's just a really great feeling for                                my life and part of the leather                                community and this is not directly                                related but I think it's important                                especially for for those of you who care                                about open-source communities to                                remember that people have all sorts of                                different backgrounds and we should try                                and be inclusive of all of these people                                and if we work together we can make                                really awesome stuff but if we don't do                                that we chase away everyone who's                                different from us and we'll just make                                the same old and we'll destroy the                                world with open-source software rather                                than saving the world with open-source                                software I mean either way it will be                                open-source but I'd rather do good then                                light it all on fire my co-presenter                                today is boo originally my coworker was                                going to come with me but on related                                notes she could not for immigration                                reasons so I just have blue mice                                animal with me today she's very friendly                                she also uses she/her pronouns and she                                is the author of learning to bark and                                high-performance barking currently                                without a publisher for those two books                                they're they're independently published                                but if you know of one looking to enter                                into the dog related book market                                definitely get in touch and her DMS are                                probably open on Twitter although I                                don't know if she knows how to read them                                so I'm hoping you're all nice people you                                laughed at my kind of corny intro joke                                so that's that's a really good sign and                                you probably care about open source you                                bothered to show up here so yeah thank                                you and I'm really curious how many                                people work on a project which is larger                                than they really thought it was gonna be                                okay that is a lot of people so this                                will hopefully be relevant to you and                                for the rest of you who are not                                currently working on a project that is                                overwhelming maybe this will be useful                                to you in the future and you can sort of                                nip some of these problems in the bud                                but before we get too far in talking                                about the things we can do to deal with                                this I think it's really important to                                remember it's totally okay not to fix                                this all a lot of us have a backlog of                                change requests and support requests and                                all of these other things that we really                                want to get to but it's just too much                                and that's okay you don't have to                                accomplish everything that being said I                                understand that that is a message that I                                have heard and then promptly ignored but                                I still think it's useful to repeat and                                yeah many of us wish we had more time to                                mentor folks but you know you can burn                                out on mentoring too it's not just code                                 that can burn you out                                 and so do not become like that very sad                                 broken umbrella I like you as humans                                 please continue to be lovely humans and                                 not umbrellas okay so we're going to                                 talk about what changes when when our                                 projects which is from like under                                    people to over a thousand people and how                                 this can make us feel kind of                                 overwhelmed we'll talk about a few                                 different community structures really                                 quickly I assume people here are                                 relatively familiar with the ASF can                                 these structures but will I'll talk                                 about a little bit we'll talk about how                                 we can try and solve some community                                 challenges with Perl scripts but that                                 not all community challenges can be                                 solved with Perl scripts sometimes we                                 have to deal with the fact that humans                                 are squishy and not programmable and                                 this is this is definitely biased sort                                 of towards the problems that developers                                 may feel more when they're trying to                                 scale their community just because those                                 are the rules that I've had in these                                 projects which have exploded a lot more                                 than I thought they were going to and if                                 is there anyone who contributes to the                                 SPARC project thank God okay cool so                                 ignore the bottom one and I am                                 definitely up to date on reviewing all                                 of the PRS foreshores okay the other way                                 of looking at this is is our project on                                 fire                                 why is it on fire maybe we can make some                                 marshmallows with this fire oh maybe                                 maybe the marshmallows was not a great                                 thing to do we should have done                                 something else oh well maybe we can put                                 out the fire or not                                 either way it's ok oh ok so let's talk                                 about the fun of a small project right                                 like a lot of us like we we like are                                 working on a small project and we're                                 like Penn will be so amazing if I had a                                 whole bunch of people to come and help                                 me out this would be so cool but but be                                 careful of what you wish for we have                                 often simpler communication and small                                 projects right there's more sort of                                 shared lore and it's easier to just                                 onboard new people slowly because they                                 will pick it up more easily often folks                                 have more aligned goals right people                                 tend to agree on smaller projects a                                 little more and it the other one is it's                                 really often a lot easier to figure out                                 who you need to talk to and this can be                                 really challenging especially in ASF                                 projects where you have a whole bunch of                                 people who maybe committers but for                                 example if you come to me and ask me to                                 commit a sparks equal patch I'm gonna go                                 and know let me go find someone for you                                 and if you go into some of the other                                 people and you ask them to commit a                                 Python patch if you're lucky you'll say                                 let me go                                 someone for you but they may just be                                 like oh I should go find that person and                                 then and then put that in their to-do                                 list and then you never get a response                                 to your email because humans and and the                                 last one is so consensus voting many of                                 us here may love it and it's a lot                                 easier to do consensus voting with small                                 projects because yeah I have like five                                 people but when I have to have                                           all agree that we want to go in the same                                 direction this can get a lot harder and                                 also with five people like you can often                                 benevolent dictator for life can just                                 work sort of but large projects other                                 people do our work for us yes people can                                 be like yo your software is cool I use                                 it sometimes this will make you happy                                 sometimes people will use your software                                 and make you sad you you got lots of                                 different ideas and experience this is                                 really only true if your project is not                                 all just a large number of people                                 exactly like you so if you're not seeing                                 a lot of diversity of viewpoints in your                                 project maybe maybe ask yourself why                                 that is and and the last one I think is                                 really nice because I like money and I                                 live in the Bay Area where housing is                                 really expensive and I enjoy being able                                 to both live in a condo and eat food and                                 so by being able to receive money for                                 working on open source life gets a lot                                 simpler and when I go to people I'm like                                 hey what's up I made this testing                                 library you should pay me to work on it                                 they're like no no but if I'm like hey                                 do you wanna pay me to work on this                                 project which like thousands of                                 companies use they're like well that                                 sounds like a smart business decision I                                 know how to business and then you                                 receive money to be fair my                                 understanding of business is similar to                                 that of the underpants gnomes so there                                 may be I'm glad to see South Park didn't                                 make it over here so there may be some                                 details that I'm missing out so okay                                 let's focus is our project on fire this                                 is the first question to ask maybe maybe                                 all of these open PRS are gonna get                                 merged                                 quickly and it's totally fine and the                                 the volume on the user list is high but                                 totally manageable and it's not on fire                                 maybe maybe it's just very bright so                                 what can we measure to see if our                                 project is on fire we can look at the                                 number of questions coming in and then                                 we can look at the number of questions                                 being answered and if they start to                                 diverge a lot that that can be bad we                                 can start to look at the number of                                 issues that are created and and also                                 resolved or closed and we can look at                                 how old is the open pull requests are or                                 whichever form of accepting changes to                                 your project you do and there's there's                                 a bunch of harder to measure things but                                 they will come if the more easy to                                 measure things happen the diversity one                                 is not a guarantee but but please try                                 yeah okay so maybe you look at this and                                 you're like yeah so last year we had a                                 hundred questions I answered                                            and someone on the mailing list answer -                                 that was pretty great and this year we                                 have a thousand questions I also                                 answered                                                                 ten and there's a lot of people who just                                 keep sending the same question to the                                 mailing list because no one's answering                                 them so maybe it is on fire yay so um I                                 think that this fire comes from our                                 classic pipeline of this theory that our                                 users will become contributors and                                 contributors can be developers or there                                 can be answering things on the mailing                                 list and then our contributors will                                 become committers and PMC members and so                                 on and if any part of this pipeline                                 stalls the previous parts of the                                 pipeline will be impacted as well and                                 this is even if your pipeline doesn't                                 stall if you have a sudden rush of                                 interest in your project like say for                                 example glorious employer decides to                                 start putting marketing dollars behind                                 your new fancy open-source thing and                                 then you get a whole bunch of new users                                 even if you don't have a drop-off like I                                 mean we all have some drop-off but even                                 if we have a relatively stable pipeline                                 the sudden influx can just make things                                 explode - so yes at the start                                 our distribution is like the only people                                 working on the project are people who                                 can change it and they're also the only                                 users and this is a really great time                                 except it's kind of lonely and I like                                 humans and if you don't this can be a                                 great place for your project to stay and                                 with slow growth if you have a way to                                 turn your users and contributors and                                 committers this can go really well and                                 so this this sloth is just kind of                                 slowly what was he along and slowly                                 become a contributor and some of them                                 will mosey some more and become                                 committers but with hyper growth we get                                 a bunch of users and then then maybe                                 they become contributors if you if you                                 put in a lot of work but then then you                                 have so many contributors and only a few                                 people to review these changes that they                                 burn out and then your contributors see                                 their code being submitted to your                                 project and going nowhere and so they                                 burn out and now you have sad users yay                                 not not yay ok the inverse of yay so but                                 I want to be clear there are many ways                                 for us to fail this is simply one of                                 them we can all fail in our own unique                                 exciting ways so it could be like                                 boiling a frog please don't try this at                                 home but your project can slowly get                                 into a bad state if people are slowly                                 burning out if your user to contributor                                 pipeline stalls you'll probably start                                 seeing this in like question overload                                 but maybe not PR overload and so this                                 can be a good time when it's like oh hey                                 I need to put in the effort to try and                                 get more of our users to contribute and                                 either answering questions or coding if                                 the contributor to committer pipeline                                 stalls you get so many PRS and then you                                 just don't review them and so that's a                                 good time to try and fix that and if the                                 committer to management pipeline stalls                                 and management is project management                                 committee or whatever system you use to                                 decide the people who are in charge of                                 running the circuits or whatever you                                 prefer to think of your open source                                 project as                                 then then all of the other ones will                                 fail but like later so like that's like                                 at least a good solid five weeks away                                 and insert joke about CPU pipelining                                 here okay remember specter and meltdown                                 and pipelines okay this goes over a lot                                 better with C programmers okay so but                                 the marshmallows are delicious maybe                                 maybe this all stalls but I'm a                                 committer and because there's now like                                 five of us and there's a bunch of                                 companies using it they're all willing                                 to pay us giant sums of money why would                                 I want to fix this problem maybe people                                 won't pay me giant sums of money anymore                                 I've become a replaceable cog again and                                 yes being a replaceable cog is                                 unpleasant but a joy of capitalism that                                 got too real um but even even if you are                                 making a lot of money as a result of an                                 inherently bad system you will burn out                                 because you will become overwhelmed and                                 then you won't make giant piles of money                                 anymore either and so either way this is                                 not sustainable um so okay what what can                                 we do to sort of address the first                                 problem right question overload and so                                 the first thing is stop trying to answer                                 all of the individual questions right it                                 can be very natural especially if this                                 slowly ramps up to just be like every                                 morning I answer the questions and then                                 I'm done answering the questions and                                 then every morning it just takes more                                 and more of your time and eventually you                                 get afraid of opening your email client                                 and then you just stop and so don't do                                 that so one option is stack overflow                                 which is special and people have                                 opinions about it but you can you can                                 sometimes trick people with shiny                                 internet badges worth approximately zero                                 dollars to answer your questions for you                                 and this is cool but even even if you                                 decide that's not for you that the next                                 question is is your like mailing list a                                 google group is it easy for people to                                 find the answers are they are they                                 searchable or are you seeing like a lot                                 of repeats because keep                                 can't find the answers to your questions                                 to their questions so summarizing                                 frequent questions you can you can just                                 write document eight just write                                 documentation sorry just writing                                 documentation is way more work than                                 writing the code at least for me and you                                 can ask for help you you can go out to                                 the users who might not want to                                 contribute code and you can be like                                 listen I think you understand this                                 really well I think would be really                                 great if you spent some time answering                                 some questions and like we could give                                 you this shiny little Internet badge of                                 like awesomeness and like then you can                                 use this to receive more money from a                                 hypothetical employer maybe and some                                 people are like that sounds fun other                                 people you offer explicit incentives and                                 then you take away the fun so I don't                                 know if it's                                                            and and the last one is filters so the                                 other one is if you're used to answering                                 all of the questions in your own project                                 just if you realize that other people                                 are helping now that's great                                 reduce the cognitive stress on you by                                 just filtering out the ones that are                                 going to be handled right just don't                                 look at those and let other people take                                 care of them for you and don't get                                 worried about it of course I say all of                                 this and I have                                                        in my spark label so I could job me yeah                                 but on the plus side I don't read those                                 and and actually I do have filters that                                 pull out when someone is experiencing                                 like a very specific PI spark issue                                 around the things that I care about and                                 know that either I can fix or I can                                 answer more quickly than other people                                 and those are the ones that I actually                                 let into my inbox and at least                                 occasionally answer by in between                                 flights okay so longer term there are a                                 whole bunch of really cool things we can                                 do                                 improving discoverability for your                                 existing answers so take your take your                                 good answers from the mailing lists and                                 put them in the knowledge base or a wiki                                 that you actually allow people to edit                                 um you know maybe index things rather                                 than slack                                 I love slack but when I search on Google                                 it doesn't show me slack history and                                 then I don't I just go into slack and I                                 ask the question again and that's bad                                 for me to do but it's it's just very                                 natural take time and explicitly look at                                 patterns I've tried doing clustering on                                 this and some some other commercial                                 vendors have have done this where                                 they've done clustering on their support                                 questions and you can you can use this                                 to trying to find sort of unexpected                                 clumps of issues and then if you can see                                 something that you can address with code                                 or even just with knots not just or with                                 better documentation you can do it there                                 too and the last one is you can try and                                 trick people into creating courses or                                 training material for your project                                 if anyone is interested in writing a                                 book about any of the projects I'm on I                                 am super happy to help you in a way                                 which does not involve that much work                                 from me definitely for you just want to                                 be clear and thankfully I don't see the                                 people that I asked to be my co-authors                                 in the audience here so please don't                                 don't share this with Trevor it will be                                 an adventure unless he watches the                                 recording he probably won't anyways um                                 so write a writing has terrible direct                                 dollar sign return on investment if and                                 and this is not always true but                                 generally speaking if you find someone                                 in you and you trick them into this you                                 should be upfront about what they're                                 signing up for this may involve them                                 walking away but you can be like listen                                 the royalties may cover your coffee if                                 you don't live in San Francisco and and                                 that's good right coffee is a                                 substantial portion of my income but I                                 live in San Francisco so it doesn't work                                 um but the indirect ROI can be pretty                                 amazing um and there can be this like                                 thing where you're like you know what no                                 one understands my project quite as well                                 as I do the solution to this is I will                                 write a book                                 and now now you have two projects to                                 bring yourself out on and and that does                                 not go well I think if you want to do                                 that definitely find other people to                                 work with and definitely find a                                 publisher who has a sort of more relaxed                                 attitude for example please do not do                                 this with pact they will make very                                 rushed decisions okay                                 yeah issue overload um so yes this is                                 our graph of our issues and purple is                                 resolved it's not going up that much but                                 don't worry the number of created issues                                 is going up so that's good yes okay um                                 great success so one of the things which                                 i think is is pretty common especially                                 for projects like spark where we do a                                 mediocre job of managing our user list                                 as people are like well I tried asking                                 on the user list and I didn't get an                                 answer the solution to this is to create                                 a gira and well it's true some problems                                 should be reported as a juror not all of                                 them should be reported as a JIRA but                                 that being said the people who are going                                 to get that far into the process if you                                 can help them with answering their                                 question they're clearly willing to put                                 in more work and maybe you can trick                                 them into helping other people yes okay                                 I should probably stop saying trick um                                 convinced incentivize persuade that is a                                 much more positive word encourage okay                                 anyways whenever I say trick just just                                 hear other words and I will try and not                                 say it as much that that's totally works                                 right I can just give you a regex                                 and you'll evaluate that as a human and                                 and the other one is lots of things                                 can't and won't be fixed right there's                                 pretty common things where people come                                 to us and they're like I made this new                                 machine learning algorithm I'm gonna                                 make an issue that's awesome and let's                                 let's fix this or alternative                                 I want this new machine learning                                 algorithm of course I haven't made it                                 but that's what you do and in both of                                 those cases the answer is no and some                                 people have some success with Auto                                 clothes this is a personal taste matter                                 as to what sort of vibe you want your                                 project to have I think some people                                 react really negatively to Auto clothes                                 and you should definitely see how if you                                 do try it out in your project see how                                 your community responds and if it is                                 simply creating more like work than than                                 actually saving and you just turn it off                                 right magical tools are only useful when                                 they help us yeah um okay this                                 screenshot is old that is now I think                                                                                                        like                                                                     like refreshed it a few times until I                                 got the right one so okay we can we can                                 have an overload on the number of PRS                                 and how do people react to to                                 contributor spikes                                 people react in a few different ways and                                 I think most of them personally are bad                                 one of them is people are like oh my god                                 there are so many changes I just need to                                 raise the bar on changes right and one                                 of this is we can we can start rejecting                                 like small typo Corrections things that                                 we consider trivial often I see people                                 being like this is just a documentation                                 change I don't need it but it's like oh                                 no no you need those changes some people                                 are like you know what if we made our                                 tooling more accessible to people more                                 people would use it so let's not make                                 our tooling accessible because there's                                 already too many people and it's like                                 yes you will have a lower number here                                 but that is not actually your problem                                 your problem is not the number your                                 problem is that you're overwhelmed um                                 and the sort of counterintuitive                                 approach is wow there are so many PRS                                 let's make it easier for people to do                                 this                                 because then I can can trick people                                 let's persuade people into helping me                                 with the review and commit process and                                 the last one is people look at this and                                 they're like I have a social problem I'm                                 gonna write a Perl script or Python                                 script for those who were born more                                 recently and sometimes this can work                                 normally no okay so rejecting trivial or                                 irrelevant changes I think this is                                 really not good                                 personally if someone wants to make a                                 lot of really small changes to the                                 project that person is amazing and could                                 totally become a committer focused on                                 all of the little tiny small things that                                 we need to fix and maybe they'll grow                                 later but like this person could take                                 care of so much for me right I would be                                 so excited to add them they're picking                                 the non-standard system to make it                                 harder I should avoid saying too much                                 about that based on where I work and                                 downsides of all of these the the the                                 ones in red are worsens the issue                                 overload so if we reject all of these                                 changes we're just gonna have a lot of                                 open unresolved issues and people just                                 keep reopening them when we don't fix                                 them and the other one is if your                                 project is becoming big enough you can                                 put all of these sort of arbitrary                                 barriers in the road but it turns out                                 that people like me enjoy eating food                                 and working on open source software and                                 employers are like we must have people                                 contributing to this project and then                                 they give you money and money overcomes                                 all of your barriers by just making it                                 so that if I don't overcome your                                 barriers I don't have food and this this                                 is not good because now the only people                                 you have are very determined and                                 probably a little pissed off and well                                 determined people are great you probably                                 don't want to have just kind of slightly                                 pissed off contributors those are not a                                 good State for them to be in doo doo doo                                 what can we solve with Perl yay butts                                 butts butts so if you if you don't                                 already have it                                 deciding on style                                 and then creating automated tooling to                                 support the linting making it faster to                                 merge and I think this is especially                                 important for ASF projects or our                                 projects which may have like a                                 public-facing repo and then another like                                 actual source of truth repo where like                                 traditional tooling doesn't work and you                                 have like a lot of steps to do merges                                 just automate that stuff if you can one                                 of the things that I love about our                                 review scripts is it automatically looks                                 at the change and then proposes a new PR                                 title and it will show me the old PR                                 title and the new PR title before I hit                                 accept so I don't have to go in edit the                                 PR title go into my merge script and hit                                 merge it's just like hey this didn't cut                                 quite match the style I applied a                                 regular expression to it just like I've                                 asked you all to do and this is the                                 result and then I go yeah that's what I                                 want and I hit yes and it's awesome and                                 the other one is and I think this is                                 especially important for for growing new                                 committers is having automated review                                 mentions and admittedly I think this is                                 important but I don't do it so yeah but                                 I'm going to try it's just not working                                 yet for a sfm for specific details but                                 essentially what you want to do is you                                 want to make it so that people of                                 contributed code are encouraged to                                 review but people don't often feel                                 comfortable reviewing code they're not                                 familiar with well I'm more than willing                                 to do that most people don't seem to                                 enjoy that experience but if someone                                 comes and changes code that they've                                 written they're often more willing to                                 take a look at it but they don't know                                 that because they don't go and look at                                 your PR review dashboard every day and                                 so you can use tooling to auto mention                                 to them that like hey there's this thing                                 I think you'd be a great fit to look at                                 it and then like they can be like oh                                 yeah I I totally am and they can help                                 you out the other one is a PR review                                 dashboard if you if you have like                                 mailing list changes similar dashboard                                 would probably be a lot more work to                                 make but it's also really useful and the                                 idea is that                                 for a lot of projects we have many                                 separate components inside of it and a                                 lot of the people who even as like                                 full-time committers may only be                                 interested in small subsets of those                                 right and this makes it really easy for                                 me to go in and be like I care about                                 Python today or I care about machine                                 learning today and this is the part that                                 I want to review and then I can also see                                 is this code in a state where it's gonna                                 be ready for me to review it like is it                                 passing ci or is it failing                                 who else has taken a look at it and have                                 they said it's good or bad right there                                 might be people who are not yet                                 committers who say like this code is                                 good and then if I'm used to working                                 with them I might be like oh yeah it's                                 probably really close I can just go take                                 a look at this and this will also be                                 really useful for getting this person to                                 become a committer and so I think that                                 this little dashboard is really cool                                 it's it's certainly not perfect and                                 needs to be customized to each project                                 but I think building something like this                                 can help yeah but I really want to say                                 even as much as these tools can help we                                 fundamentally have a community problem                                 at this point where we're overwhelmed                                 we can't just by people more mottai or                                 redbull we need to we need to scale the                                 number of people involved and and I                                 think this is also really important is                                 to decide what we're not doing and this                                 is the example I mentioned with Auto                                 closing issues SPARC is a lovely project                                 with a lot of imperfections but one of                                 the things which we've done an ok job is                                 constructing road maps of our mission                                 learning stuff specifically and it's                                 like these are the things we are willing                                 to do everything else probably not come                                 and talk to us before you write code                                 here and and the other part of this is                                 if you're not going to do something with                                 your project try and make it pluggable                                 so people can still get their thing done                                 and you don't have like three different                                 Forks of your project that are all                                 slightly out of sync like we did with                                 the kubernetes support spark                                 that one didn't go so well we decided we                                 weren't going to do a thing but with                                 them we also decided that it was going                                 to be way too hard to make it pluggable                                 and so three different people all just                                 decided you know what the solution to                                 this is a fork and they were all right                                 it was very unfortunate um Interac does                                 a good job of having like a really clear                                 roadmap of what they're doing and also                                 making it accessible it's it's in their                                 github it's not hidden somewhere else                                 like you you get this when you're                                 checking out the code our road map is                                 not as discoverable for machine learning                                 inside of SPARC and there's some notes                                 about it in here you can see some                                 examples okay the other one like we can                                 try and take our like however many                                 committers we have and and just make                                 them more productive with these tools                                 but it's it's really not enough you're                                 you're going to have to make it so that                                 your committers are more feel less sorry                                  dammit                                 okay the part that I wanted to say here                                 and I screwed up is one of the things                                 which I see happen with a lot of new                                 committers is that they get their                                 commitment and they're like this is                                 amazing oh my god what about if I break                                 the project everyone is gonna hate me                                 they're gonna realize that I'm a                                 complete fraud they're gonna take this                                 away from me oh dear God oh dear God and                                 just make it okay to break Master we                                 have version control if you don't go get                                 version control this is okay if you want                                 to accidentally break the project                                 yourself to show people that it's okay                                 to break the project that is okay it's                                 not exactly lying and one person is                                 except two people are excited about that                                 and and just lead by example and when                                 they break the project don't yell at                                 them be like cool let's see how to                                 revert this and let's talk about why                                 this may like broke the project and what                                 we can do better next time more tests                                 can also always help etc yay I'm                                 fundamentally you probably need more                                 committers if you're in the PR overload                                 you can encourage people to become                                 interested in becoming committers by                                 being like man being a committer so cool                                 i go to these conferences yeah sometimes                                 people will be like that sounds exciting                                 I'd love to do that other times they're                                 like I don't want to go to our                                 conference no no and you can be like                                 that's totally cool too don't you want                                 to just be able to like make the project                                 better faster without having to wait on                                 other people and they're like yeah                                 that does sound like a good thing I'm                                 tired of waiting on other people and you                                 know if these people are becoming                                 committers there's a good chance that                                 you have gotten to know some of their                                 personality so tell your message to them                                 evaluate how you pick committers I think                                 this is challenging for us in the ASF                                 sometimes consensus voting is a really                                 great way to eat at the Cheesecake                                 Factory and while I've only gotten food                                 poisoning at the Cheesecake Factory once                                 I do not want to eat at the Cheesecake                                 Factory all that often                                 and so if some people are consistently                                 using their veto perhaps aggressively it                                 can be a good time to be like hey do you                                 like doing a lot of review work cuz I                                 want to share this with other people                                 what can I do to make you more                                 comfortable with sharing this with other                                 people like these people want to help us                                 um making guides for committers so that                                 they can actually see how to become a                                 committer right you might have                                 contributors that just don't know how to                                 move beyond that and mentoring people                                 that doesn't really scale but you can                                 like mentor people and then you can be                                 like and one of the great things that                                 you get to do as a committer is mentor                                 new committers and then then it's sort                                 of scales it's like that bad pyramid                                 marketing where we sell you makeup                                 except I sell you open-source software                                 for free yes okay                                 there are lots of ways to mentor people                                 it's hard to scale it's hard to find                                 people really excited about mentoring if                                 you do hang on to them                                 if you can't just drink a lot of Mota                                 then mentor some people and then you                                 need to move them on to effective                                 committers I think one of the things                                 which as much as we love the dev list                                 sometimes it can be overwhelming and                                 scary for new committers because they                                 are like oh no I must pretend that now I                                 know everything oh god I can't ask what                                 to do so so make it like hey it's ok to                                 come and ask me a question it's totally                                 ok and a lot of the mentoring stuff is                                 about your own project as illustrated by                                 this thing that I clipped out of the ASF                                 website mentoring a new committer                                 here's the basics that are true across                                 all Apache projects to do if anyone                                 wants to fix that Paul requests welcome                                 but more seriously I think this is very                                 much a good indicator of the fact that                                 as much as I can tell you mentoring is                                 important it is all about communicating                                 the things specific to your project                                 easier to contribute you can get new                                 contributors they can become committers                                 life is great                                 reduce the overhead to contribute well                                 make it easier for people to make it not                                 so hard for you good documentation about                                 how to do this decisions are gonna get                                 harder even with consensus voting you                                 have this feeling of loss of control                                 sometimes please you know be better                                 about that and technical things can                                 explode but that's pretty much on you                                 I'm not gonna be able to help you with                                 that in the remaining three minutes                                 technical problems can often be fixed                                 with technical solutions though so yeah                                 wrapping up it's ok not to be perfect                                 this is fine everything is fine yes the                                 project is on fire but the marshmallows                                 are delicious most importantly I have                                 this book it is unrelated to this talk                                 but each book covers about a quarter of                                 a cup of coffee in San Francisco and you                                 can help me from turning back to a life                                 of enterprise support contracts and you                                 can buy this book so with that oh yeah                                 I'll be doing a bunch of                                 yeah we're done okay if you can pretend                                 to be excited for like                                                 there we go                                 thank you so Christians okay so the                                 question was if I could show the                                 previous slide this is the previous                                 slide I'll be doing some livestream code                                 reviews I'll do a code review today and                                 some live coding tomorrow and I'll do                                 office hours at a coffee shop nearby and                                 if you want an excuse to go to New York                                 you come hang with me next week do you                                 have any tips for dealing with entitled                                 users that post on the mailing list and                                 then a day later open an issue and then                                 a day later DM you on Twitter and then a                                 day later have mailed your personal                                 email address and you think might be                                 about to turn up your house those kind                                 of people that that really care but                                 maybe you're getting a bit overwhelming                                 yeah that's a really hard question to                                 answer personally if someone shows up at                                 my house that is probably the point                                 where I would call my corporate security                                 team and also let my neighbors know not                                 to let in people asking about                                 open-source software I really hope that                                 the strange people that show up at my                                 house just try to continue to sell me                                 candy bars for the like Twitter teams                                 and stuff I normally I'm just like                                 listen I would love to help you but it                                 just doesn't scale you need to go to the                                 list I'm really sorry I just don't have                                 the time and if they don't respond well                                 with that then I blocked them deal with                                 that I don't like getting yelled at and                                 then it makes me not help the other                                 people so what is your view on canned                                 replies to common questions as opposed                                 to a personalized reply                                 canned replies are amazing if people                                 hate them                                 then reconsider and write a better Perl                                 script for your kind replies I love your                                 advice thank you and I will subscribe to

                       probably yeah you you can also follow me                                 on Twitter yeah oh yeah well I mean but                                 for the other fine folks in the room who                                 wish this high quality content of jokes                                 about Perl it's pretty solid okay well                                 then thank you very much we have a small                                 coffee break in the pub a                                 [Music]                                 [Applause]
