Description: 
	Is your project market ready? Defining Collaboratively the Open Source Market Readiness Index: Progress Report, Lessons and Challenges.

As it becomes increasingly mainstream, OSS reaches out to conventional decision makers who are far from free software advocates. These business managers expect more than code, they expect a product. Not all open source projects are global stars of the software world. For the majority of outsider open source projects, the challenge is to align with the experience and expectations that conventional decision makers have developed in dealing with well established commercial proprietary software vendors. 

To address this challenge and provide guidance to both developers and decision makers, we, at OW2, have endeavored to develop an Open Source Market Readiness Index. At OW2 we are convinced this tool must be collaboratively designed, built and maintained by those who will use it, the open source market participants and, in the first place, leaders, contributors and users of open source projects. 

As we started working on it as a transparent and open process we learned some valuable lessons and discovered unexpected challenges. After a quick introduction to the concept and the methodology this talk is a progress report and a presentation of a workable Market Readiness Scale that will undoubtedly raise questions and invite feedback.

	                              thank you thank you for the kind                               introduction good afternoon all I'm                               Cedric Thomas I read notably too we are                               an open source organization and we host                               three dozen projects many of them are                               targeting infrastructure functionalities                               and there are complex components for the                               information systems so we we don't deal                               much with we deal with software                                developers but we also deal with end                                users and we are often confronted to the                                situation where entries is often prefer                                proprietary solutions and we realize                                that it's often because open-source                                software might not fit exactly their                                expectations so this is sorry there so                                this is about open source for the                                business decision maker for the event                                average the conventional manager the                                person who is not necesary sold on                                operative we're not in the process                                activist and someone who really are                                would much prefer dealing with                                proprietary vendors and the thing is                                between the average developer and many                                developers in this conference who have                                the developers they talk to other                                developers and this money for instance                                one of the keynotes highlighted the fact                                that we should stop looking inward but                                looking outside and consider ourselves                                that we fit in a broader market and this                                broader market is out there but from the                                point of view of the developer the                                broader market is a little bit far away                                and we think there is a gap between the                                devil developer between the software                                that is developed and what the end user                                is looking for its identify if I may                                take this analogy like music this is                                music and music is the code but what the                                user wants is really the final project                                [Music]                                so this is not exactly what you read                                this is what you feel this is what you                                enjoy this is where the value is as I                                said programmers write code code this                                takes you don't do anything with text                                but what the end users want it's a                                product and the product is not just the                                code it's code plus a lot of things                                documentation training contracts pricing                                roadmaps support other other users                                marketing etc and in the case in the                                case of operations of software there is                                even more they need to trust the                                software because they don't know because                                some for many conventional decision                                makers the open source software is a                                little bit evil so they want to trust                                the software they want to know where it                                goes so this is what they want and that                                creates the value but the value is not                                only created by the developer it's                                created by the ecosystem they consist                                them are the distributors the systems                                integrators the consulting companies the                                contributors themselves the users                                themselves even the open source                                organizations we add value we create the                                ecosystem that makes the software the                                Opera Software valuable usable by the                                average decision maker so the average                                decision maker doesn't choose just on                                the good face they want to know about                                the software the components take let's                                take another analogy with the automotive                                industry today the leading car                                manufacturers don't manufacture all the                                cars what they do they integrate they                                own the customer they own the trend they                                they imagine the next car they analyze                                the needs and then they have all the                                parts don't provided by third-party                                providers the front end is provided the                                Lightning is provided by its not by them                                the dashboard the sitting arrangement                                the all the glass parts all this comes                                from different suppliers of course today                                the electronics all this comes from                                different suppliers and we have the same                                thing in in the in the software industry                                this analysis by sono type found that                                   to                                                                     reuse components they don't say whether                                they open-source components or not but                                it's good a good proportion of these                                reuse it comes from opposite of software                                so we need to know what the components                                 are about and there is a very busy                                 landscape out there about measuring                                 components and understanding where they                                 come from so many of the tools have been                                 some of the tools have been described                                 here in this conference about how we                                 understand that the the software about                                 compliance governance etc and many tools                                 are there to help us understand what's                                 behind the component what's in the older                                 components and to make sure that we can                                 trust these components even at the w-                                  we have developed our own platform for                                 collecting data and reporting data to                                 the users we survey the the quality of                                 the code the IP of the code etc and that                                 generates a lot of data we generate too                                 much data in fact we publish this data                                 we want to be transparent the users can                                 access all about the the project we host                                 but can they make decision we are at                                 this stage what we feel that we need to                                 help the decision maker the decision                                 maker is not the open source software                                 architects or developer the decision                                 maker we have in mind is the average                                 decision maker who often select a                                 component a software on the under                                 reputation of a name so we need                                 something simple and we are thinking of                                 moving towards a more simple synthetic                                 indicator that's what we're doing so                                 when we're looking at a simple indicator                                 we have something called the the NASA                                 technology readiness levels you've heard                                 of these readiness levels it's a type of                                 mention measurement that allows us to                                 understand to evaluate the maturity of a                                 technology it's been very successful                                 it's been reused by the Department of                                 Defense Department of Energy and now                                 it's you see it in any research project                                 proposal that's what it looks like it                                 has nine levels and these ninth levels                                 go from the bottom where you only have                                 the idea of the                                 it's something that no one can do                                 anything with up to the top level where                                 you have the components that has been                                 orbiting around the planet and came back                                 if it had come back from useful to use                                 from useless to useful so we we feel                                 that we can do something like that and                                 we have developed our own template like                                 the NASA TRL levels we've developed the                                 W to market readiness levels from a code                                 that is in the process of being                                 developed to establish project establish                                 product that any average user can                                 contrast but this is just it's a good                                 idea like that in fact we have to                                 develop this and we need to rely on data                                 we need to rely on tools that skander                                 cause that's kind of communities we need                                 to collect a lot of data and that's what                                 I would like I wanted to share with you                                 this evening and asking contributions so                                 it's a kind of request for comment what                                 I'm doing here and we have a establish                                 already our methodology the mythology is                                 in five steps the first step is to                                 define the metrics metrics that are                                 relevant to what we want to do to want                                 to want to express metrics that is                                 available as well there is no need to                                 look in for metric that cannot be                                 collected this matrix we have to collect                                 it but there is a feedback loop because                                 it evolves like any index like like                                 Stock Exchange index that involved so we                                 need to be able to to update this as the                                 situation evolves then these metrics                                 have to be put in certain format then                                 next once we have these metrics in our                                 mind and when I say format can be dates                                 etc we want to collect this metrics and                                 correcting the metrics can be done in                                 several ways automatically through many                                 of the tools that are out there for                                 instance we use we use force ology now                                 we use scan code a sonar cube we upload                                 some gitlab                                 I mean the the development                                 infrastructure that used but develop                                 provide a lot of metrics but there are                                 also some other types of metrics but                                 communities about the governance that                                 the the history where the curves come                                 from where they want to how they manage                                 the contributors and this is to be                                 collected manually so we have tools and                                 forms once we have collected the metrics                                 we have to process them processing the                                 metrics means for putting them all in                                 the same format and normalizing them and                                 then fitting this into some models                                 models that would produce some results                                 now here the issue is that the model                                 should not be black box there should be                                 absolutely understandable with by                                 end-users that's what we've done a                                 little bit with our this edge where we                                 are with publish we publishing their                                 models now another next stage once we                                 have the models and some results we have                                 to publish this results and publishing                                 results its other another another                                 challenge in fact because there are ways                                 to publish this the results are their                                 permission thematically well is it as                                 graphical do we feed this into                                 downstream systems these are some key                                 issues and again there's always feedback                                 groups to complete the system and in                                 fact the the last stage is to share that                                 to communicate to reach out and to make                                 sure that we don't work on our own in                                 our ivory tower but that we share with                                 everyone and that we aligned with market                                 expectations so that's that's what we                                 want to do but doing this is very much                                 it seems simple like this the idea is                                 simple but then as we executing this and                                 we are about a year into developing this                                 we realized that there are lots of                                 questions it opens up avenues boulevards                                 and a lot of side streets and it's there                                 are it raises questions the more you get                                 into it the more questions it raises for                                 instance some of the questions are the                                 metrics I just mentioned that you have a                                 trade-off between what's possible and                                 what's available but then the project                                 support community for or for profit is                                 it one rationale fits all or do we have                                 to do we need to have two differents                                 processing audio scales for for the                                 project there is a different perspective                                 the business perspective is versus the                                 engineering perspective the engineering                                 perspective is the one that                                 is from the developers point of view                                 where you'll consider the progress of                                 your project was the market but the                                 business perspective is not that at all                                 the business perspective is that from                                 the business manager who's used to deal                                 with mature business project and just                                 want to expect that so he says do we                                 have this or not so it's not at all the                                 same the same way the context is                                 different sorry the scientific world and                                 there is a lot of applesauce in the                                 Surfing environment it's not exactly the                                 same doesn't behave doesn't expect the                                 same things as the business world                                 process I mentioned the data collectors                                 with those reforms so we have automated                                 collection of data or manual rate data                                 we have rational that is different so do                                 you want to measure something and                                 provide snapshots or do we have to                                 measure the evolution is it the changes                                 that we want to show do we - do we                                 update the data we can update weekly                                 monthly or second-by-second or or upon                                 events like each commit can trigger an                                 update or build can be you can turn the                                 trigger and update that's the sort of                                 things we still have to decide and then                                 representation to finish with this you                                 have the the right representation is                                 probably good but little bit complex and                                 there's something we want to avoid we                                 don't want to create a hierarchy between                                 our projects because a project that is                                 in the beginning of the phase is just as                                 good as valuable as a project that is                                 already an established project product                                 well supported and well recognized by                                 the market so we don't want to create                                 this kind of hierarchy and we still                                 struggling or deciding how we're going                                 to show that the the starring stars is                                 maybe one way the the the temperature                                 thing is maybe another one so that's                                 just to share very quickly with you some                                 what we do some of the questions the the                                 metrics today we are measuring about to                                                                                                     points are at least                                                     have gone to                                                           you have to keep this manageable so                                 again we can go wrong and those are the                                 the challenges and as                                 often it's all about execution and the                                 devil is in the details so that's why we                                 need to collaborate with you and this is                                 a process that is totally open there is                                 a web page there and we work on any kind                                 of contribution comment or feedback                                 thank you any questions yes what would                                 be a comparable assessment platform for                                 proprietary software                                 oh this there are some projects very                                 comparable project there's the the cows                                 the Linux Foundation that's been doing                                 this in the framework of the core                                 infrastructure initiative there were                                 many other projects there was a European                                 project called calico that aimed at                                 evaluating open source software there                                 was another project which we are                                 leveraging which was called riscos not                                 very good name because it's supposed                                 that upwards of software is risky so                                 it's not that it's it had some inputs                                 there are currently there is currently a                                 project a European project called cross                                 miner who's developing technologies to                                 collect data and we collect data from                                 from the development tools but also from                                 mailing lists from comments do some                                 sentiment analysis well this is                                 something that we try to automate in                                 that we gradually incorporate into our                                 understand hours sorry outside of open                                 source pattern outside of the open                                 source world like is there a successful                                 come as a comparative platform for                                 proprietary software not that I'm aware                                 of but if you know if any I'd be happy                                 to look at them so why is why do we                                 particularly need such a platform for                                 open source rather than proprietary                                 soffit because there's plenty of you                                 know non open source applications which                                 have questionable quality origins and                                 support as well right                                 can you repeat the question yeah this is                                 only for open-source software right                                 actually we started this for our own                                 codebase and we realized that it was a                                 topic that interested many people it's a                                 topic that also helps instill a little                                 bit of business awareness in the mind of                                 the developers so they have to                                 understand that they may be the center                                 of the world but the world is big out                                 there and that they develop for end                                 users that are confronted with offerings                                 from proprietary vendors so why is it                                 necessary to have platforms like this                                 only for open source and often all open                                 source products like why would a rating                                 system for the thousands of proprietary                                 desktop or software-as-a-service                                 applications no necessary I'd say                                 because open source software is                                 developed in a way that is much more                                 transparent and that at least for in our                                 case we have access to our own                                 infrastructure there's one thing I have                                 to mention this data to w                                                independent infrastructure so we can                                 access to all the the the data we want                                 so for this we are totally sustainable                                 we're have no allegiance to any IT giant                                 or any economic power so we can carry on                                 analyzing or components another thing is                                 that there is more data available on                                 open source project than on proprietary                                 software it's true that I've been                                 approached by large companies who said                                 we could apply that to our own codebase                                 the same way you have open source and                                 inner source you know so that has                                 nothing to do with open source well here                                 they said we can follow your approach we                                 came to learn from what you discover and                                 now your maturation and maybe implement                                 something like that inside our own on                                 for own codebase and I think of big big                                 companies from tens of thousands of                                 people I mean and huge software                                 development I have another question                                 other other other question is first ok                                 do you think that given that there are                                 not comparable platforms for proprietary                                 software that serve the same purpose do                                 you think that your platform                                 - could result in the perception that                                 these open-source applications are less                                 stable or trustworthy as a group which                                 is why there is a need for such an                                 independent rating and assessment and                                 analysis in the first place because if                                 you have one category of applications                                 which proprietary that do not have                                 independent ratings and assessments like                                 this and you have another group that do                                 then the implication could be that the                                 second group isn't more using greater                                 need why it's not because we're trying                                 to make them more transparent and give                                 the end user information in order to                                 build trust in this operative software                                 that we acknowledge that this open                                 source way is not stressful it's not the                                 case now no we think it's stressful but                                 we need to demonstrate it so it's like                                 we have we have support rate that is                                 mature and they have customers they have                                 end users they have distributed systems                                 integrators working on them consulting                                 all this and that is part of what some                                 of the people want they expect this on                                 top of everything that has been                                 discussed in this conference with regard                                 to the quality of the code etc and the                                 compliance which is basic but then we                                 need to go a little bit once that that                                 ones have further to complete the the                                 whole process between the programmer and                                 the average decision maker who rise to                                 the check I'll just keep going then so                                 do you have some kind of buttons or                                 certification or visual signs of                                 accreditation for the for the projects                                 which you have assessed that could add                                 value to those to those products I was                                 here working on the visual                                 representation of the project so as I                                 said it could be the radar thing and we                                 want to move away from this because it's                                 probably a bit too complicated and                                 that's why we want to develop this                                 synthetic indicator so that the average                                 decision-maker we say okay this is rated                                                                                                      don't want any                                                        that level minimum and what does that                                 implies that implies that I have                                 something that has all the other                                 complements that is not just code but                                 it's something that can control for the                                 long term that's very interesting and in                                 order to                                 be a member of your platform and to have                                 this assessment done membership fees are                                 paid by organizations if they exist in                                 in order to cover the cost this is a how                                 so how it works no there's no business                                 model there so if this is that we                                 promote the codebase okay and we will                                 benefit if our project benefits so who                                 your members who you're paying members                                 in that case or who will they be                                 we're nonprofit organization we are                                 financed by membership so our members                                 pay the fees that I guarantees our                                 independence and with this money we have                                 a new purchase governance the Board of                                 Directors and the technology can so by                                 the way both are our instances of making                                 decisions and they decide and they                                 approve this kind of project and decide                                 yes this is a good thing to do for the                                 good of our code base and our projects                                 so it's open but instead of just doing                                 it just for ourselves the idea is to                                 share it with everyone and make sure                                 that it's done in the open and gather as                                 much feedback from the market as                                 possible so if I wait long enough maybe                                 you'll add my project without may have                                 independent Mufi no right now we don't                                 have the resources to apply this to all                                 the open source world okay so we                                 concentrate on the project we can                                 interact with which are the db                                          actually we have projecting incubation                                 maturation mature and the archive we                                 concentrate on the mature project at the                                 moment and as you and at this stage we                                 need to interface with the project                                 leaders because some of the data as up                                 to be gets where for instance if we look                                 at some code quality data a unit test or                                 exist some time they're not very much                                 accessible so we need to streamline this                                 with the project leaders and then there                                 are also all the type of information                                 with regard to the community the weather                                 manage contributors as I mentioned the                                 type of software drop environment they                                 have beside beyond the the other between                                 for structure so this is to be                                 documented                                 most of this information has to be                                 gathered on a form with the                                 collaborative live with a project leader                                 thank you thank you again Cedric
