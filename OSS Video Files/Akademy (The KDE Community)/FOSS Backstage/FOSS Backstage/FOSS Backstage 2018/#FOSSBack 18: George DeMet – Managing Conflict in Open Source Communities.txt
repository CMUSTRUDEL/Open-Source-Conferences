Title: #FOSSBack 18: George DeMet â€“ Managing Conflict in Open Source Communities
Publication date: 2018-06-21
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	Technology communities in general and open source projects in particular frequently suffer from a lack of diversity, with low participation rates by women, people of color, and other marginalized populations who are frequently targets of harassment and abuse.

This session will talk about the tools and techniques and approaches used by various open source communities to help support and maintain friendly environments for large and diverse groups of contributors from around the world.

We'll discuss how these communities manage conflicts and the various challenges they've faced while working to help keep their projects welcoming and inclusive places that support positive participation by all.

	                              thank you for that introduction and                               welcome to managing conflict and open                               source community one can hear me okay                               excellent great so my my day job that I                               get paid for is that I am the founder                               and CEO of Palantir dotnet the dotnet is                               important we're a full-service web                               agency based in Chicago and we work with                               a variety of different open source                                technologies but the reason I'm here                                today talking with all of you all is                                really more in the context of my                                community involvement so we've been                                working with open source I've been                                working with open source for                                         now and and I don't know how to code you                                really don't want me to write your                                module or anything like that the last                                time I was really useful in terms of web                                development was around the time when we                                still needed Internet Explorer                                          so that's not how I contribute to open                                source I volunteer my time in a variety                                of different ways focused around the                                people side of open-source so around                                community around governance things like                                that and for the last few years I have                                chaired the Drupal community working                                group so we're a volunteer group                                chartered by our project lead that's                                responsible for upholding the Drupal                                community code of conduct and helping                                mediate conflicts that arise so Drupal                                if you're not familiar with it is one of                                the world's largest open source projects                                we have over a hundred thousand active                                contributors it's an absolutely enormous                                community Drupal is used by millions of                                sites all around the world and and the                                project has been around for about                                   years over                                                           time we've gone from being this kind of                                small hobbyist community to this really                                large project that's used by you know                                enterprises at every level as well as by                                people for their personal blogs so it's                                a really amazing community to be a part                                of and along with that growth right                                we've had some growing pains right so                                Herbal has grown progressively more                                complex with every major release the                                time between releases has increased and                                more is being asked the developer                                community by customers and end-users                                right so as a result we've seen this                                kind of increased stress this Inc                                increased pressure which results in                                frustration and conflict right it's                                something that occurs in every open                                source project but it's really when you                                kind of get to that growing pains place                                right where you're no longer kind of a                                bunch of people who are all know each                                other and coming together to build a                                project where you're all this enormous                                project with people all over the round                                the world that you start to really see                                you know some of these issues so this is                                from a                                                            Drupal contributors asking them about                                their experiences during the Drupal                                  development cycle Drupal                                              the end of                                                           respondents had experienced or observed                                conflict and this is actually fairly                                consistent with the results that we see                                from other open source projects so last                                year the folks at github                                conducted a survey across hundreds of                                different open source projects which                                found that                                                          have personally experienced a negative                                interaction with another user and open                                source but half of witnessed one between                                other people so this is a problem that                                we're all dealing with now I want to be                                really clear that the ability to                                exchange ideas with others is a big part                                of what makes open-source great right                                and not all conflict is bad right                                positive respectful disagreements where                                people are actually listening to each                                other and seeking to find common ground                                can contribute to a cross-pollination of                                ideas challenge existing preconceptions                                and help people find creative and                                innovative solutions to problems and                                generate innovation right that's what                                makes open-source so awesome and sets it                                 apart from so many other models for                                 developing software                                 the problem is when people don't feel                                 like they're being heard they don't feel                                 like they're being listened to her that                                 their contributions are being valued                                 right or that their interests aren't                                 being represented or that they feel hurt                                 by something that someone else said or                                 did right and and fundamentally conflict                                 is about unmet needs right                                 this negative conflict so what we want                                 to try and do is address these issues                                 these problems so that people feel even                                 if they don't agree with a decision that                                 was made that they've been heard and                                 that they are part of a community so                                 some of the kinds of issues right that                                 manifest all the time in open source                                 right many of these will pry seem very                                 familiar to many of you write technical                                 disagreements that turn into personal                                 attacks you know well you only want to                                 do that because it benefits your your                                 company or agency or you you've always                                 been against this solution because it's                                 my idea whatever right frustration with                                 the amount of time that it takes to                                 review patches in Drupal we have project                                 applications had to go through a gateway                                 for a while and that was a caused a                                 tremendous amount of frustration folks                                 felt that there were artificial blockers                                 to contributing or if they contributed                                 something it would take a really long                                 time for someone else to look at it and                                 review it and you know provide feedback                                 and that is an intense form of                                 frustration people just for any of the                                 you know above reasons or for others                                 just lashing out you know and the issue                                 queues venting their frustration you                                 know ragequitting you know I literally                                 before this you know right before this                                 session started we got a report just                                 like one of these where someone was                                 really upset that they weren't getting                                 the technical support that they were                                 looking for and they're like well this                                 is why this project sucks right and then                                 finally we'll talk a little bit more                                 about this later a little more                                 harassment and trolling on social media                                 and in slack write or IRC if your if                                 your project still uses IRC or use a                                 sorry sorry still uses IRC or uses one                                 of the other open source alternatives to                                 slack right regardless of the tool you                                 use there there is harassment and                                 trolling and personal attacks and other                                 issues that manifest so the consequences                                 of this right obviously we have a                                 decline in contributor morale people                                 don't really feel like contributing if                                 everyone's fighting all the time which                                 also results in a decline in                                 productivity in the project lead to                                 people leaving the project when we go                                 back to that github survey I said the                                    percent of people who experienced or                                 witnessed a negative behavior said that                                 they stopped contributing to a project                                 because of it and when you keep in mind                                 that that's over half the people who are                                 who are experiencing or witnessing                                 conflict and                                                           leaving that's a big problem that's a                                 huge drain on on any open source project                                 and then people might you know choose                                 not to join a project right if a project                                 has a reputation for being a place you                                 know with a toxic atmosphere where                                 people are fighting all the time then                                 they're going to be less interested in                                 being a part of that and then ultimately                                 this has an impact on diversity right                                 and so some of these I'm not going to go                                 into too much detail on these that if                                 you were at the diversity panel earlier                                 today they went into some of these                                 numbers you know but essentially                                 according to github only                                            source code contributions are made by                                 women in Drupal we measure about                                       the recorded contributions or by women                                 and even at our in                                 person events like DrupalCon we're lucky                                 if we can get                                                         right so there are I think this is                                 really hard to measure unless you're                                 just measuring code but I think one of                                 the key points I want to make is that                                 there's lots of different ways to                                 contribute to open source that are not                                 just about code there is literally I did                                 a ton of research on this I've talked                                 with a few folks there is no good data                                 on representation and open source by                                 people of color there I think may have                                 been some studies that were done about                                                                                                       because you know we can kind of guess                                 when we look around rooms and we you                                 know talk with people and we see who                                 shows up at conferences that people of                                 color are very often underrepresented                                    percent of the people in github                                 open source survey identified themselves                                 as racial or ethnic minorities in the                                 country that they live in if we apply                                 that to the United States where I'm from                                 that about                                                         population identifies as a minority so                                 that tells me that you know we have a                                 disproportionate under-representation                                 there but this is one of those places                                 where more research is definitely                                 required what we do know is that women                                 are far more likely than men to                                 encounter language or content that makes                                 them feel unwelcome as well as                                 stereotyping and unsolicited sexual                                 advances right and unsurprisingly as a                                 result that means that women are also                                 more likely than men to seek out help                                 directly from people they already know                                 rather than ask for help from strangers                                 in a public forum or channel right and                                 if you think about it right                                 collaboration between strangers is again                                 one of open sources most remarkable                                 aspects right so what we need to do is                                 strive to build a community where                                 everyone feels welcome to participate                                 and you know and again the impact of                                 is highlighted by the fact that on                                 github but pull requests by women are                                 actually more likely to be merged than                                 those made by men but that's only true                                 if their gender can't be identified from                                 their profile this was a study that                                 someone did and open-source work is an                                 incredibly important way for people to                                 build their professional reputation                                 right half of contributors say that                                 their open-source work was somewhat or                                 very important in getting their current                                 role open and him so improving                                 contributor representation can help                                 create a more representative tech sector                                 overall even beyond just open source so                                 this is the big point right reducing                                 negative conflict helps make open source                                 more welcoming more inclusive and more                                 innovative so how do we go about doing                                 that right so a lot of open source                                 projects have codes of conduct right and                                 it's very simplest form a code of                                 conduct is a policy that's used by an                                 organization to establish standards for                                 behavior and appropriate conduct when                                 interacting with others in a defined                                 space right whether that be a conference                                 a workplace project event venue this                                 conference has a code of conduct most of                                 the projects that you work on have a                                 code of conduct most of the events you                                 go to associated with other project with                                 projects have a code of conduct so in                                 the context of a virtual community right                                 as opposed to a physical space codes of                                 conduct are designed to help create                                 inclusive places where people can feel                                 safe and welcome to contribute and again                                 the research shows us that documentation                                 that clearly explains the project's                                 processes such as contribute                                 contribution guides and codes of conduct                                 are valued more by groups that are                                 underrepresented in open-source                                 so a well-written and well implemented                                 code of conduct and help address some of                                 these issues right by making it clear                                 that the community does value openness                                 does value diversity and are committed                                 to providing inclusive                                 that's free of harassment where people                                 are welcome to contribute in a                                 professional manner so now to be really                                 clear just having a code of conduct does                                 not get rid of every issue right but                                 what it does is it sets the ground rules                                 right and make sure that everyone                                 understands the values of your community                                 and the ground rules for interacting                                 with others right so the contributor                                 covenant and the citizen code of conduct                                 are fantastic starting points there are                                 lots of other good codes of conduct and                                 code of conduct models out there there's                                 Jango project code of conduct which has                                 also been adopted by the jQuery                                 foundation and others of course right                                 here's the big caveat right code of                                 conduct is worthless if there's no                                 structures to support it or mechanisms                                 to enforce it so different projects                                 again handle this in different ways                                 right                                 so sometimes it's the responsibility of                                 one of the projects maintainer x' or an                                 existing group such as a technical                                 working group so examples of this would                                 be Ruby on Rails or kubernetes right                                 where it's very tightly tied to the                                 folks who are in charge of the project                                 overall in projects with a strong                                 corporate sponsorship or oversight it                                 might be handled by an employee of the                                 company or a professional community                                 manager who's hired specifically for                                 that purpose so some examples there                                 would be Mozilla Microsoft and Google                                 for the open source projects that they                                 run or it could be a dedicated group                                 made up of volunteers from the community                                 right so that would be some examples                                 there jQuery Jango and of course Drupal                                 regardless of what the model is ideally                                 you want to have multiple people who are                                 empowered to handle code of conduct                                 reports you need to have these people                                 fully understand and appreciate the                                 responsibility that's involved as well                                 as be folks who other members of the                                 community can feel safe talking to and                                 can trust to handle any reports                                 they make with discretion so I'm going                                 to talk a little bit about what we do in                                 Drupal because that's what I'm very very                                 familiar with so we have the Drupal                                 community working group there are                                 between four and six of us on the group                                 at any one time                                 we are an all-volunteer body we have no                                 staff we have no resources we have no                                 legal representation we do not have a                                 formal relationship with the Drupal                                 Association which is the nonprofit that                                 is responsible for the drupal.org                                 website the events and some of the other                                 things associated with the project we're                                 an independent group that is chartered                                 directly by Drees Boy tart the project                                 lead so he appoints or approves its                                 members and if somebody appeals a                                 decision that we make he would be the                                 designated person to review that so we                                 have a couple of primary chartered                                 responsibilities                                 we're chartered to uphold the community                                 code of conduct help resolve conflicts                                 between community members and maintain                                 documentation and processes related to                                 community health there's some certain                                 tension actually between these primary                                 chartered responsibilities because                                 upholding the code of conduct kind of                                 puts us in an enforcer role                                 whereas helping resolve conflicts                                 between community members puts us in                                 more of a mediator role and so this is                                 something that's been a little bit of a                                 challenge in terms of how we work with                                 community members understanding the                                 context in which we are talking with                                 them about an issue right because                                 sometimes it will be a hey you did this                                 thing and it was really not cool and we                                 need to talk about it and sometimes it's                                 like hey I see you two are having a                                 disagreement and it's getting a little                                 heated let's talk it out right and folks                                 especially in the heat of the moment                                 don't always understand which context                                 were approaching that conversation so                                 it's                                 important for us to be clear about that                                 we do other things too because you know                                 honestly those of us around the                                 committee we care about our our our                                 community greatly and we want to help it                                 be the best that I can so you know one                                 of the things we do is we recognize and                                 support community leadership we give out                                 an annual reward to folks you get a free                                 of really cool little trophy and you get                                 a free pass to the DrupalCon conference                                 and it's it's nominated by members of                                 the community for somebody who shows                                 kindness and a a above-and-beyond                                 dedication and devotion to the community                                 and we've been able to recognize some                                 truly wonderful people and it's it's                                 it's really great to see that kind of                                 recognition for folks who are doing                                 something to helping make the community                                 and the project better in a way that                                 goes beyond just contributing code we                                 provide resources consultation in vice                                 sometimes someone will come and be like                                 hey I'm wrestling with this problem I                                 don't necessarily have a report or an                                 issue that I want to file I just am                                 looking for some advice and so we'll                                 provide that to the extent that we can                                 and then of course right sharing which                                 is kind of what I'm doing today right                                 sharing the experience and best                                 practices that we've learned with folks                                 from other open source projects and this                                 is something I really want to see more                                 of in general so I'm really happy that                                 we have this venue here today to be able                                 to do that so this is a lot of stuff to                                 do this work is really complex it's                                 really time consuming and very often                                 it's emotionally draining and it is it                                 is a lot for for a volunteer group to do                                 but somehow we muddle through so I love                                 this quote by bell hooks of who's                                 American author and scholar she says for                                 me forgiveness and compassion are always                                 linked how do we hold people                                 accountable for wrongdoing and yet at                                 the same time remain in touch with their                                 humanity enough to believe in their                                 capacity to be transformed right and                                 this is kind of the frame that we try to                                 approach conflict and issues in our                                 community right we don't think of                                 ourselves as the Drupal police right we                                 don't our role is not to decide who's                                 right and who's wrong in a given                                 situation as much as it is about helping                                 people in our community work together in                                 a mutually respectful way and to take                                 responsibility for the impact of their                                 words and actions right and I mean yeah                                 and and so usually it's it's not about                                 what you said was wrong so much as hey                                 what you said had this impact on someone                                 else and it's important to understand                                 that and and to own that and to the                                 extent possible take responsibility for                                 making it right we want people to have                                 as much control over the outcome of                                 their dispute if they're in conflict as                                 possible while still maintaining a safe                                 and welcoming community and this is hard                                 because you know very often the very                                 natural reaction is hey someone said or                                 did something that really hurt me and I                                 want them to pay I want them to be                                 punished and that's not really what                                 we're set up to do if somebody does                                 something that's really wrong and they                                 need to be removed                                 we have no qualms about doing that but                                 if it's a dispute that can be settled                                 between two people we're gonna do our                                 darndest to find a way to do that so a                                 big part of this is about process right                                 so unless an issue requires immediate                                 action our process is designed to enable                                 resolutions that are as thoughtful and                                 as permanent as possible as opposed to                                 reacting quickly based on emotion and                                 this                                 that it can be take a long time it can                                 be drawn out right and I think one way                                 to think about it is when you have                                 people who are maybe at a bar who are                                 about to get into a fight because                                 they're really upset at each other for                                 one reason or another and sometimes what                                 you need to do is just kind of get these                                 people outside and separate them from                                 each other and talk them down a little                                 bit when we can do that that's what                                 we're going to try and do so so when an                                 issue comes in to us right what we'll do                                 is we'll gather as much information as                                 possible from all the involved parties                                 we in order to ensure that people are                                 able to share their stories with us and                                 then open and honest or we don't share                                 any names or other sensitive details                                 outside the group without permission                                 right so once we have that kind of                                 sufficient level of detail to get                                 started we meet as a group we have                                 weekly meetings on hangouts our group is                                 distributed we have folks in the United                                 States we have folks who are based in                                 South America we have folks who are                                 based in the UK and Europe and so we get                                 together once a week we also have a                                 private slack channel that we that we                                 maintain and can communicate in between                                 meetings and then we decide what to do                                 with the issues that are in front of us                                 right that we have enough information we                                 may decide to do nothing right if we                                 think that someone is filing a report in                                 bad faith or if they're it's outside our                                 jurisdiction as a group we may decide to                                 just go back to the reporter and say hey                                 we're not going to take any action on                                 this and here's why right we may offer                                 suggestions for those involved to try                                 and resolve the issue themselves right                                 rather than intervening directly                                 sometimes we do need to do mediation                                 that can take the form of we're going to                                 talk with one party we're going to talk                                 with the other if we think it makes                                 sense we may then have them talk with                                 each other with one of us present                                 sometimes that works sometimes it                                 sometimes we you know the best answer is                                 for them not to interact with each other                                 but sometimes we can actually make it                                 work and that's nice so in the cases                                 where there's a clear code of conduct                                 violation we'll talk with the person or                                 persons who engage in the violation to                                 help them understand the impact that                                 their words or actions had and if                                 necessary we will recommend permanent or                                 temporary bans from various community                                 spaces so again because we're not part                                 of the Drupal Association we don't have                                 legal jurisdiction or control over you                                 know user accounts on drupal.org or                                 whether or not someone is allowed to                                 come to one of our events but what we                                 can do we have very good relationships                                 with the Drupal Association and we can                                 go to them and talk with them and say                                 hey this happened and this is why we                                 think this person should be banned from                                 an event or why that their user                                 privileges on the web site should be                                 revoked and then they will take the                                 appropriate action so you know in some                                 cases where we have where we have issues                                 where there's there's someone for                                 example who who might be get upset in                                 the issue queues a lot and be show their                                 frustration in unproductive or                                 non-productive ways right                                 sometimes what we can do is is intervene                                 with that and when we receive them of a                                 variety of multiple reports right                                 sometimes what we need to do is go to                                 that person and and help them understand                                 and take responsibility for the fact                                 that hey you know when you yell at                                 people it has an impact on them and                                 let's see if we can find some better                                 ways to communicate feedback so that you                                 can be a more effective contributor you                                 don't have to spend your time dealing                                 with all of these reports that                                 people are making and you can actually                                 help others become more effective                                 contributors as well so again sometimes                                 that works sometimes it doesn't but we                                 think it's worth the effort to try in                                 some cases we might receive an                                 after-the-fact report about a situation                                 that's already been resolved in those                                 cases we review the incident decide                                 whether further action is necessary and                                 keep it on file for reference just in                                 case something similar comes up in the                                 future involving you know one or more of                                 the same folks well most of the issues                                 that we tackle come from issues that are                                 reported to us our process is not                                 exclusively complaint driven we're all                                 active and engaged members of our                                 community and if we think that if we see                                 something that we think needs to address                                 we'll put it on the agenda and talk                                 about it as a group so over the last few                                 years we've learned a few lessons we've                                 learned a lot of lessons here's a few of                                 them one is that when we're in the                                 conflict resolution or mediation process                                 it's really important to manage                                 expectations and make sure that all                                 involved parties agree to accept the                                 outcome of the proposal we can't always                                 assume good faith and you know if folks                                 agree to go through this process of                                 mediation they can't just get to the end                                 of the process inside well you know I                                 don't like that advice I'm going to                                 ignore it at that point then we need to                                 take additional action escalation and                                 appeals need to be well defined and well                                 documented you know particularly when                                 you're dealing with a conflict chances                                 are that that one or both parties was                                 not going to like the outcome of that                                 and and if they do decide to appeal it                                 needs to be clearly understood what                                 their options are                                 using discretion when deciding what                                 details to share publicly this is a very                                 challenging one because you know then                                 one of the things that Denise said in                                 her keynote this morning right was that                                 like transparency was the lifeblood of                                 open source and sometimes we can't be in                                 this work sometimes we can't be                                 transparent because doing so would harm                                 others or would undermine trust making                                 it less likely for people to tell us                                 when things are happening on the flip                                 side in some cases not sharing certain                                 details can also have the same effect so                                 we need to be really careful and this is                                 highly dependent on the type of                                 situation what's going on                                 but we need to be able to so one of the                                 things that we do in our in our report                                 so we put out anonymize public minutes                                 and say hey we dealt with this issue                                 this is roughly what it involved and we                                 try to word that in a way that unless                                 you were one of the folks who witnessed                                 or was directly involved you're not                                 going to necessarily know who it was                                 about here's what happened here's the                                 action we took that's really hard to do                                 and we don't always do it well one of                                 our buyer colleagues on cwg was at an                                 event last week and you know was talking                                 us through with with some folks at a                                 session there and got some really good                                 feedback so I think we know how to make                                 our minutes clearer of course we also                                 have a non public version of our minutes                                 that we keep where you know we're able                                 to to see and talk about exactly who was                                 involved in what happened in more detail                                 alluding to what I said earlier this is                                 intense emotional labor so we have to                                 remember to practice self-care we work                                 we have to work really hard to mitigate                                 or prevent burnout this is really hard                                 work and you know the reality is that                                 you know maybe                                 this is something meet someone who could                                 maybe do for a year to a little bit                                 longer if you're a cold-hearted bastard                                 like me but it it is really hard work                                 and it it does require being able to                                 know when to say look I need to step                                 back I need to take a break for a little                                 bit so I can come back with fresh                                 perspective and then of course one thing                                 we've definitely learned and I think                                 this ties in to the point I made on the                                 previous slide about about transparency                                 is that even if we can't talk about the                                 specific incidents or the specific                                 people involved we always need to be                                 communicating our purpose or scope and                                 and our process is how we do things to                                 the wider community and so this is                                 something that we started to do we when                                 we're able to we go to local events                                 meetups and camps we talk there we have                                 a session at the at the Drupal                                 conferences the one in the US and the                                 one in Europe so folks our folks are                                 able to find out who the heck we are                                 what we do and how we do it so I'm gonna                                 talk a little bit about some of the kind                                 of hot-button issues that we've been                                 struggling with over the last                                 particularly last couple years one is                                 online harassment which is just really                                 exploded as an issue for us in the last                                 couple years and so there are some                                 people who feel that no matter what they                                 say or do outside of a project space                                 only their behavior inside the project                                 space should matter this is a hot-button                                 issue but but to me it's it's pretty                                 clear right if you're harassing and                                 attacking people on social media you                                 can't then turn around and expect to                                 collaborate productively with those same                                 people on the project right so so I                                 think this is something that we need to                                 clearly be thinking about as projects is                                 not just what's happening in our queues                                 what's happening you know with our                                 issues but like what's happening the way                                 that individuals                                 who are participating those projects are                                 interacting outside of it so maybe                                 really clear this is not a matter of                                 free speech or political correctness                                 this is about treating those around us                                 with basic human dignity and respect                                 right                                 so the shared values of our code of                                 conduct apply regardless of what your                                 personal political social religious                                 views are but they're not an excuse to                                 avoid accountability for your words and                                 actions so as someone who's responsible                                 for upholding a code of conduct it's not                                 always easy to identify what the trolls                                 are and to hold them accountable                                 particularly if they're hiding behind                                 anonymous handles or working in                                 coordination with others right so I                                 think this quote which is from a New                                 York New Yorker article about reddit                                 explains it really well right so troll                                 set this cunning trap if you ignore them                                 you risk seeking you risk seeming                                 complicit but by responding you amplify                                 their message right and I come from the                                 old days of Usenet and and all this                                 stuff where the advice was ignore the                                 trolls right and one of the questions                                 that we're wrestling with right now is                                 the extent to which we publicly speak                                 out about specific acts of trolling in                                 our community knowing that doing so may                                 draw more attention to the trolls and                                 run the risk of validating their efforts                                 on the other hand we're also hearing                                 from people who say that they really                                 want us to speak out about this stuff                                 because they want us to make it really                                 clear what sort of behavior is and is                                 not acceptable in our community so                                 that's something where we're kind of                                 wrestling with another issue that we're                                 working with is how to deal with                                 incidents of context collapse right so                                 this is when people start sharing a                                 story on social media without all the                                 relevant details or context and                                 demanding that immediate action be taken                                 because it seems like something that's                                 like really bad                                 sometimes it can be the result of a                                 simple misunderstanding sometimes the                                 result of intentional distortions or                                 misrepresentations but either way these                                 these sort of things end up being                                 leveraged by people who may be pushing                                 one agenda or another and the way to                                 deal with it is to provide the context                                 right and then you know be patient try                                 to understand what actually happened as                                 fully as possible before you know taking                                 action based on something that people                                 are outraged about online that's a                                 really hard thing because sometimes                                 sometimes it's legitimate sometimes it                                 is something that is as bad as it sounds                                 and you do need to take action and                                 sometimes it's something that's taken                                 out of context or misunderstood and                                 being able to tell the difference is                                 becoming something that's increasingly                                 important okay I've got a couple more                                 minutes left other new challenges we                                 need to address the fact that there's                                 larger issues with harassment and                                 assault that have been lying below the                                 surface of years and have gone                                 unaddressed what we know is that people                                 don't feel often don't feel safe                                 discussing their concerns openly because                                 of the fear of backlash that will result                                 so we need to get people to feel safe                                 talking about these issues otherwise                                 people will think that the code of                                 conduct doesn't mean anything if there                                 if if if there are as somebody who is                                 engaging in bad behavior and it's only                                 being circulated through whisper                                 networks and no reports are being made                                 and there's no way for the folks who are                                 responsible for enforcing the code of                                 conduct to know about it then they won't                                 take action and people will think the                                 code of conduct doesn't mean anything                                 and won't take and it will be less                                 likely to make reports in the future                                 right so we need to improve our                                 processes for handing for handling                                 accusations of sexual harassment or                                 assault in a manner that is respectful                                 of the needs of the victims we need to                                 keep better records of incidents that                                 have occurred in the past so that we can                                 more quickly catch patterns of conduct                                 that occur you know I think we also need                                 to especially in the United States                                 alcohol is very often a component many                                 of the incidents that are reported to us                                 so we need to have an honest discussion                                 about the fact that while many of us                                 spend time together socially we're also                                 a professional enduring community of                                 purpose you know some of us are here                                 because we're paid to be it's our job                                 and I think we also need to develop                                 better relationships across projects to                                 mitigate the impact of people who may                                 engage in and do terrible things in one                                 project and get kicked out of that                                 project and then just go and do the same                                 thing in another project I would love to                                 see some sort of United Nations of open                                 source that could address these kinds of                                 cross project issues so got a minute                                 left I want to leave you with some                                 positive things that we can all do in                                 order for everyone to be successful in                                 open source so streamline communication                                 channels make it easier for newcomers to                                 go to connect with other contributors so                                 that there's fewer misunderstandings mix                                 asynchronous and real-time channels                                 Skype hangout slack etc as appropriate                                 and understand and appreciate that                                 English is not everyone's first language                                 second keep improving documentation                                 create easy to find summaries of active                                 initiatives in your project so                                 contributors can get involved with                                 issues that interest them and provide                                 architectural overviews for future                                 contributors three and there was some                                 talk about this in the last session                                 expanding membership mentorship programs                                 so that they don't just focus on                                 newcomers providing more support and                                 training to mentors and pairing mentors                                 with high potential contributors for                                 long term one-on-one mentorships provide                                 non code mentoring opportunities such as                                 event organizing promote its mentorship                                 success stories in your community make                                 it clear that this is something that's                                 incredibly valuable also broadening                                 creating a network of leaders within                                 your community and with an open source                                 in general who have different                                 backgrounds experiences and perspectives                                 and focus on developing skills                                 like creative problem-solving conflict                                 resolution effective advocacy and                                 visioning the more that folk were able                                 to broaden understanding of the projects                                 community its assets and its challenges                                 the better we'll be able to to build                                 leadership within the community and so                                 that when we do experience challenges                                 there will be people there who have the                                 tools to be able to mitigate them so                                 let's get started and thank you very                                 much                                 jobs thank you very much are there any                                 questions I would like to know how the                                 community reacted when you introduced                                 this working group because I assume it                                 didn't just exist but at some point it                                 was pitched and at an or I don't know                                 how that work but yeah yeah so so the                                 question was about you know how the                                 community reacted when the working group                                 was proposed right as X was that correct                                 yeah                                 so that was that occurred in Drupal                                 about six years ago and I I had been                                 involved a year earlier in helping to                                 promote an event code of conduct for our                                 events we already had a community code                                 of conduct but we didn't have a code of                                 conduct for our events and that                                 conversation back in                                                 really contentious because at that time                                 a lot of people did not understand or                                 appreciate the value of having a code of                                 conduct for event so it was very much a                                 lot of folks in the community were                                 mentioned we all know each other we all                                 trust each other can't we just rely on                                 that which wasn't sufficient coming out                                 of that conversation in some other                                 conversations it was really clear that                                 we needed some additional structures and                                 governance in Drupal because we were a                                 and are a rapidly growing project and we                                 were very quickly getting beyond that                                 hey we all know each other place and so                                 dreams the project lead got a bunch of                                 people together over they had basically                                 a weekend where they kind of worked out                                 some of these ideas and basically                                 proposed it as part of there was                                 community working group there was                                 technical working group there were a lot                                 of sort of governance items that kind of                                 all came together at once it was                                 something that a lot of people felt was                                 really needed and so we didn't get a lot                                 of pushback at that time now that was                                 now at this point when                                 thirteen five years ago we're at the                                 point where we have actually outgrown                                 that governance model and we're trying                                 to figure out what the next governance                                 model looks like you know and there may                                 be changes they're very very will likely                                 be changes to the way that we handle                                 conflicts and code of conduct issues as                                 a result of that and it is a challenge                                 because we are really getting stuck on                                 what the best way to achieve that is                                 right that there's we're very much a                                 community that is all about sort of                                 things bubble up from the community                                 which is awesome and wonderful and great                                 and but there's also a desire to have                                 some kind of top-down you know                                 governance as well and so and folks                                 agree that that is necessary but what                                 that exact balance is is a matter that                                 is highly contentious so I think I                                 answered more than your question there                                 okay thank you very much to us we have                                 run out of time but your round here so                                 the next talk will be out in six seven                                 minutes thank you everyone                                 [Applause]
