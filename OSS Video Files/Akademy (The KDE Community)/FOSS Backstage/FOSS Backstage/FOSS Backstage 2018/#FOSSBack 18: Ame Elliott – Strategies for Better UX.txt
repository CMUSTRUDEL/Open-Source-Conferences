Title: #FOSSBack 18: Ame Elliott â€“ Strategies for Better UX
Publication date: 2018-06-20
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2018
Description: 
	A system may have technical features, but if the user experience (UX) is confusing, people will not be able to use them. UX is more than icons and colors, and UX skills in information architecture and writing are particularly important for expanding the reach of FOSS projects to a wider audience. This talk provides practical starting points for open source teams interested in improving their UX, including strategies to incorporate user research and feedback.

	                              thanks I appreciate you dedicated people                               staying till the very end I'm going to                               spend                                                           practical hands-on UX tips that you can                               put into practice on your projects right                               away I am the design director of simply                               secure this is my twitter handle i                               tweeted out a copy of these slides                               they're available if you find them                                helpful so simply secure is a us-based                                nonprofit I'm currently located here in                                Berlin and we focus on questions of                                security privacy transparency and ethics                                our historic core has been around                                supporting open source secure                                communications projects but we've                                expanded our focus into some other kind                                of more emerging areas like specifically                                domain areas around things like IOT and                                machine learning but developers are one                                of our core audiences and a lot of our                                work and my work in particular is                                professional education to get software                                developers going with some of the basics                                of UX so that they can get their                                products and services and Technology                                accessible to you and usable to a                                broader group of people so they're there                                to kind of things topics I'm going to                                talk through the first is basically what                                UX is and that UX is more than colors                                there's a misconception that it's just                                kind of icons or font choices and I'm                                trying to show a little more context                                around that and the second is on the                                user research side which is around                                asking why and not what so definition                                user experience design or UX is creating                                digital experiences that meet people's                                needs and I think one of the                                graphics that I find pretty evocative                                for communicating what UX is or just                                this set of screenshots because these                                are all clear and understandable at at                                this scale you don't really need to know                                the details of what's going on here to                                be able to make some judgments about the                                flow between the screens so I'm gonna                                share kind of two examples here and this                                is the the counter example to prove the                                point that user experiences more than                                icons and colors this is some                                screenshots from a few years ago of lock                                icons of the Chinese mobile Internet so                                I don't speaker read Chinese so many of                                these you know products are kind of                                beyond me this is an image shared from                                Dan Grover who'd worked there and I                                think that from someone that comes from                                an organization that really works on                                supporting secure communication tools                                and things like and and encryption a lot                                of these live lock icons don't really                                convey much meaning because it gets into                                questions like what's your threat model                                and as a designer I can make a lock that                                has two states and one state is open and                                on click it goes to closed if you'd like                                it can even make a little sound and and                                that's not hooked up to anything that is                                completely a cosmetic change so instead                                of these kinds of only superficial color                                and font and logo choices I want to get                                into some of the the kind of deeper                                examples of behavior and how to                                communicate behavior to users so the                                reason that I feel that this is a                                critically important topic is that I                                believe in the mission of many open                                source projects but I am concerned that                                some of that good work is limited and                                impact because people often don't                                understand what's going on so the user                                experience designer shape the                                understanding people's understanding and                                influence behavior that if the in                                face doesn't make it clear that how                                something works                                people can aren't going to use it so I                                think that developer first software can                                often be be very kind of elegant from a                                behind the screen code point of view it                                may have a lot of features but a lot of                                the kind of nuance and an elegance of                                what those features can do is lost in                                that last kind of bit to communicate to                                end-users how stuff is supposed to work                                so this is an example that I consider                                kind of the opposite of the lock badge                                 icons that aren't that meaningful so                                 this is from these are screenshots from                                 messaging apps they're taken from an                                 iPhone and just at this this scale I can                                 see that as an iPhone user I get green                                 speech bubbles or blue speech bubbles in                                 the iOS native messaging client                                 depending on if my messaging partner is                                 also using an iPhone so that's just some                                 information for me about kind of what's                                 going on with the other person but then                                 read receipts I think are an example of                                 how UX clarifies some complex                                 functionality in a very very simple way                                 so in the iOS messaging client you get                                 words a couple of characters read at a                                 time or delivered whatsapp the messaging                                 platform has a convention that some                                 groups opt to use checkmarks to issue                                 read receipts and that checkmark is an                                 example of a UX decision that I think is                                 pretty effective it works all around the                                 world I don't need to know if my                                 messaging partner is on Android or iOS I                                 don't need to know if they're on Wi-Fi                                 or the cellular network I don't need to                                 know if they're telecom or AT&T or                                 orange or any of these global service                                 providers it just works                                 but the thing that makes this                                 interesting to me from a UX point of                                 view is that it changes behavior so an                                 example of a functional description                                 would be a different messaging app mase                                 we issue read receipts but if the way                                 that you get to a read receipt is you                                 long press on the user's name this the                                 sender's name and then get to the                                 message menu and then you type in                                 message ID you know equals                                              it's your                                                              status is zero or status is one that is                                 meaning that maybe the functional                                 requirements of issuing a read receipt                                 but it's not going to change behavior in                                 the same way so paying attention to the                                 presentation of information another                                 example information architecture what                                 you put on menus this is a very                                 important way to help people navigate                                 what is going on with with your product                                 how to make it discoverable to other                                 people so one kind of quick way to get                                 started is to look at the menu structure                                 and put them on post-its and look at it                                 and a common thing that happens                                 particularly in open-source projects                                 with distributed contributors is your                                 team structure shows up in the menus and                                 in some cases that's totally fine and in                                 other cases that might not be quite so                                 helpful so in one example I'm not going                                 to you know kind of name the team that                                 worked on this because I don't want to                                 point them out for the purpose of                                 shaming them but it was just interesting                                 that when when I looked at this tool                                 that was targeting people that wanted to                                 shoot live video as a kind of a news                                 source they had two different kinds of                                 parallel structures one was templates                                 and the other was something like                                 examples and the templates team was                                 different than the examples team and                                 that was sort of why they had this kind                                 of parallel structure but as a user that                                 that's not really helpful to me there                                 was so much overlap between those kinds                                 of things that I didn't really get how                                 they were different so one kind of                                 really clear pragmatic thing that you                                 can work on with a team is a style guide                                 this might be something that you use to                                 codify what you already                                 are doing the choices you've already                                 made or it could be something that you                                 would want to hire a designer to produce                                 for you and you know I think that the                                 Tor project has recently put out there                                 style guide or a design worked on that                                 simply secure how to played a part in it                                 as well and I think that's actually a                                 pretty nice example of showing how a                                 style guide isn't some kind of like                                 top-down police decision making about                                 how everything must conform it's                                 actually a tool to concur Ajmal r                                  contributors and more distributed                                 contributions over time because you have                                 a little bit of the rules of the road                                 you have agreement on exactly what the                                 the hex color for your different fonts                                 is going to be and that can be a way to                                 help people do something consistent so                                 in the physical space at the top colors                                 are a bit washed out but at the top you                                 see or what its intended to be a                                 Starbucks cup with they have an iconic                                 green color that they've taken the care                                 and attention to get that color all                                 around the world different inks                                 different papers different continents                                 they've really made it clear that that                                 kind of color stands for something and                                 it's what they are so I guess the one                                 side summary of this so far you access                                 more than colors and icons it's these                                 details that shape understanding and                                 influence behavior so the next kind of                                 chunk of this is around user research                                 and asking why and not what said it's                                 never too early to get user feedback                                 even if you're at the idea stage                                 different methods work for different                                 phases of the process so that's kind of                                 thing one to keep in mind and the second                                 thing is if you do user user research                                 and sit down with someone they aren't                                 going to tell you as as a developer like                                 what to do they're not going to give you                                 advice they're going to talk about their                                 own problems and tell you what they are                                 trying to do I recommend in-person                                 observations with people using stuff                                 wherever possible this is me                                 in the field kind of learning about you                                 know how messaging works some people who                                 are power messengers and when you get                                 the opportunity to actually sit side by                                 side with people and look over their                                 shoulder it can be an extremely                                 effective extremely eye-opening way to                                 to get feedback but even if you aren't                                 going to go talk to people outside your                                 organization my QuickStart tip number                                 one is take what you have and print it                                 it's not that I don't like trees it's                                 that something kind of magical happens                                 when you print things and pin them up on                                 the wall similar to you know over the                                 course of you know my speaking career I                                 could proofread something so many times                                 a presentation but somehow once it's up                                 on the screen behind me really large                                 it's much easier to find the typos all                                 of a sudden it's just kind of the way                                 that things things work sometimes and                                 when you print something out you're able                                 to decontextualize it a little bit make                                 it a little bit unfamiliar and it'll                                 give you a sense of fresh eyes that it                                 may help you already start to answer                                 some of your own questions like wow                                 there's really a lot of stuff going on                                 under this one menu and like why are we                                 calling this this and how do these                                 screens relate and that's a UX activity                                 that you can do with only a screen                                 capture tool and a printer and start to                                 look at look at the structure and see                                 what you see a second quick start tip is                                 if you're unsure you're stuck you're not                                 clear on how to move forward with the                                 feature what are good ways to do things                                 take an example that's out there now                                 particularly a popular example so I                                 don't support the values of every kind                                 of mass mainstream software a product                                 that's out there but I can say that in                                 general things with very large user                                 bases are usable so if millions of                                 people are able to use something you can                                 look at them as an example for how to                                 present things in a way that a wide                                 group of people a global audience can                                 navigate this is a screenshot from jitsi                                 which is                                 no video conferencing software and this                                 was part of an exercise to kind of give                                 get some comments around how to                                 communicate values to you to end users                                 how do you explain the benefits of your                                 your product and then finally I would                                 like to encourage you all to think not                                 only about the product that you're                                 building but also the companion pieces                                 that support how you talk about it and                                 this is pretty controversial to show at                                 a venue you know like this that's so                                 committed to open-source but I thought I                                 would take the risk because it's late                                 and hopefully everyone was a bit relaxed                                 so this is an example from a website                                 where I mean we'd ask people to                                 highlight parts of it that they found                                 confusing and one of the things that                                 came through very consistently this is                                 in the context of people who used file                                 sharing services and cloud-based storage                                 and in this case there was a really big                                 emphasis and a really big kind of                                 open-source love pride and leading with                                 open-source as a differentiator for why                                 to use their product and not any of the                                 competitors in that audience and in this                                 case really didn't understand that so I                                 think that as a community there's a lot                                 of work to do on how to communicate what                                 makes open source software special to a                                 mass audience and in this case this                                 claim you know open source software                                 anyone can read the code and confirm                                 that it doesn't have secret backdoors                                 makes a ton of sense this person                                 actually understood that to mean                                 something more like I'm expected to                                 check the own code might be code myself                                 even though I don't have the skills to                                 do that and the sense was that                                 open-source was too much like                                 crowd-sourced                                 and that it was just going to be like                                 the whole community that people they                                 didn't really know what they were doing                                 we're going to somehow contribute and                                 build something so that that actually                                 you know isn't really consistent with                                 the message that they wanted to convey                                 so I'd like to give some some positive                                 praise to least Authority an open source                                 distributed file system                                 and you know they have done a you know a                                 bunch of work on the UX side                                 particularly you know in their grid sync                                 product around kind of security                                 education and a lot of the way that                                 they've done this is through this paper                                 prototyping method and having an end                                 user sit down and walk through a stack                                 of pages printed out screenshots while                                 they think aloud yes of course it's real                                 software but sometimes it's nice to do                                 it on paper when you do it on paper you                                 can pull things side-by-side it can be a                                 much easier way to kind of talk about                                 what the flow is and many people who've                                 been to school are quite comfortable if                                 you give them a piece of paper and a pen                                 to make some notes and in some circles                                 and things that are on the screen can                                 feel so formal and finished especially                                 to people that don't write code                                 themselves can be a nice way to get some                                 some feedback so this is a extremely                                 quick and basic way to make like                                 wireframe so these are screenshots from                                 the Twitter app on the mobile phone and                                 in this case I'm actually holding a                                 printout of the screenshots in a window                                 that's backlit with a piece of plain                                 white paper over it and that makes it                                 very easy and possible to to trace over                                 them so that you can start to see these                                 kinds of things so the magic that just                                 happened here is these are printouts                                 that I traced in the window and the                                 result is something like this where I                                 can now start to call out at the right                                 level of abstractions what are the menus                                 named what are the different things that                                 you can click on how is this structured                                 and this is the way that most UX                                 designers learn how to do projects                                 designers that don't work on a dedicated                                 product team all the time they're gonna                                 find something similar and print it out                                 and do this kind of exercise in order to                                 kind of get clear on what the structure                                 is and this slide was a bit out of order                                 but I'd also like to give some                                 recognition to the tails team                                 on the simply secure blog my colleague                                 Eileen Wagner recently wrote up an                                 interview with their team that talks                                 about some of the work that they've done                                 on their ux/ui Sprint's it's an                                 open-source operating system for people                                 with high security needs and they kind                                 of give some developer kind of                                 perspectives on that so those are the                                 two kind of chunks of this this talk you                                 access more than colors ask why not what                                 and to conclude I'm just going to                                 reiterate user experience design deal                                 details shape the experience and if an                                 interface has technical features in the                                 UX is confusing people won't use them                                 it's actually even potentially more                                 dangerous than that because open-source                                 contributors may enjoy the ability                                 knowing they have the ability and the                                 power to check the code but most people                                 are making judgments on the quality of                                 the engineering based on the quality of                                 the UX by most people meaning a kind of                                 mass audience so by way of conclusion I                                 would like to say that simply secure org                                 we have a knowledge base with a bunch of                                 different topics                                 there are blog articles on a kind of a                                 range of things in the UX plus security                                 space including more about how to get                                 going in UX and in user research as an                                 educational NGO we work for you so we                                 welcome your feedback on what to                                 prioritize if there's an article or a                                 resource or a topic you were hoping                                 would be addressed and it wasn't please                                 let us know and with that I will say                                 thank you                                 these are different ways to reach out to                                 us if you're interested in joining our                                 public slack channel these are our                                 twitter handles in my real email address                                 so thank you very much                                 [Applause]                                 questions remarks iPhone Mike I'm really                                 happy that you're here and that UX                                 design has some place on this conference                                 because everybody remembers remember the                                 early times about software but it was                                 really a pain in the neck to use it                                 because he couldn't figure out what                                 button means what and how the different                                 things works so as me as a software                                 engineer and as a user I'm really proud                                 on thank you very much for getting                                 involved and I forgot to say open source                                 design a super cool group we've got                                 different representatives here we're                                 going to have a little meet up during                                 the social event that's happening                                 immediately after this so we will be                                 near the food with some kind of sign I                                 believe you can look for me an                                 open-source design is a group of you                                 know designers you want to support                                 better design work in open source                                 projects it's a place that people can                                 post requests of work that they would                                 like contributions that they'd like from                                 the community as well I mean I I think                                 that people who are committed to                                 open-source want better design out there                                 and there are many resources and more                                 kind of coming up that are available for                                 people to use and reuse and adapt but I                                 there aren't like I mean I'm not an                                 expert on all of the different nuances                                 of that but in the UX world in the                                 front-end development world generally                                 there's a ton of like toolkits and best                                 practices and things that you know                                 different organizations are making them                                 and they're really hoping that they're                                 going to be replicated and customized                                 and you know forked I guess would be the                                 analogy hi thank you for this wonderful                                 session and I really enjoyed it                                 my question to you is I'm not a you                                 a designer or a web developer how can I                                 take this into the api's that I design                                 how can I take your experience wonderful                                 experience making sure that the user has                                 a good experience using the product how                                 can we take that to the API is that we                                 design I mean the UX of API design is                                 like a real leading-edge topic and I'm                                 starting to see more attention given to                                 it especially people that are worried                                 about things like machine learning and                                 automated databases and how do you help                                 the people that are using these tools                                 make more ethical decisions so right now                                 there's a lot of interest but there are                                 very few kind of successes to point to I                                 would say that you know if your kind of                                 responsibility is creating api's then                                 your end users are software developers                                 and that it's possible to do user                                 research with software developers                                 czaja file and he hasn't me and ace are                                 here in Germany have done some really                                 interesting studies qualitative                                 quantitative of how developers get                                 information and it's everything from                                 like finding out that security errors                                 are being replicated from unsecure code                                 and stack overflow because Stack                                 Overflow is a place that a lot of                                 different developers go to get examples                                 and there's a mistake there it gets                                 replicated you know throughout the                                 ecosystem so I would say the same kinds                                 of things around you know figuring out                                 what kinds of you know what would go on                                 the sticky notes is the equivalent of                                 menus and trying to make that graphic                                 and visual and supporting people that                                 are working and kind of the enterprise                                 UX side ok thank you Amy thank you very                                 much for interesting talk                                 you                                 [Applause]
