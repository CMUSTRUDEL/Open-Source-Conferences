Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2014: Breno Faria, Christoph Goller - High quality, low maintenance content tagging
Publication date: 2014-05-28
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2014 #bbuzz
Description: 
	On ApachCon 2012 we presented a system for content tagging at ZEIT Online. This talk presents recent work on improving the ranking of the tags by building exclusively on the data (complete ZEIT Online News Archive). Tags are either named entities, statistically relevant terms/phrases occurring in the news articles or topics delivered from text classification. 

The system uses open-source technology such as Lucene and Gate to produce these tags. We will present the requirements and expectations of an online editorial office on such a system and ideas on how to meet those expectations. All tags are ranked based on trend analysis, typical contexts and overall TF-IDF scores, all computed on the whole archive. No manual maintenance of thesauri or ontology resources is necessary.

	                              ok so I'll start hi I'm Brianna Faria                               is a joint talk with my colleague Chris                               of gawler but since it's a kind of short                               talk i will be doing it my only myself                               and he's sitting here in front and he                               will be available for questions in case                               you have any you can come to me of                               course also i work for inter find intro                               find is a company there is an elastic                                search partner we specialists for                                information retrieval and text analytics                                we're strongly based on open source                                technologies we have to leucine                                committees on board and we're we have                                high quality linguistic analyzers for                                mostly European languages and we have                                most of our customers are in the                                german-speaking European area so we are                                very good at German analysis and we also                                do entity extraction and other                                information extraction exactly I'm the                                outline for the talk I would present a                                project that we have going on at site                                online since                                                          bit about the beginning of the project                                how the workflow in the editing office                                is and what the requirements are and how                                we we try to meet these requirements so                                that site online project side for those                                of you that don't know is a very                                renowned and newspaper in Germany it was                                founded                                                              World War Two and it's issued weekly and                                site online is the the web page of the                                the newspaper it was begin it began                                   and of course it's not weekly issued its                                online                                                               project and site came to us and said we                                want to have our whole archive of                                articles since                                                  researchable and am tagged with metadata                                because we want to link                                articles between themselves so what kind                                of metadata we're talking about we're                                talking about classical named entity                                extraction this is a text book named                                entity extraction problem it's I think                                rarely in my experience it's rare to see                                projects where people actually do want                                to extract person locations and                                organizations when you have enterprise                                data this is rarely what enterprise                                customers want to extract but in the                                case of a newspaper this is actually                                interesting of course we beside                                extracting entities we also extract                                other statistic statistically relevant                                keywords which are not necessarily                                entities and we do text classification                                because we had to classify the old                                articles into the new editorial sections                                that they have and at the website of                                side you can browse the keyword archive                                you can click on the keywords that                                desire that exists and you will get a                                list of all the articles ever written                                that mentioned this keyword or person or                                location etc and the guys at site and                                they have opened this content there's an                                API for accessing this this archive                                which is pretty cool this is a graph                                that you can hardly see I guess but it's                                a graph of the                                                          in the year of                                                       it's a nice picture it's also a nice                                feedback tool for the editors themselves                                because they can in a picture see what                                they have been writing about in one year                                and where they might be missing on right                                and they actually do use it as a                                feedback tool so how does the the work                                how's the workflow in the editorial                                office the second step was of course                                after we tagged the whole archive and                                made it a searchable we they wanted us                                to integrate this tagging system into                                their workflow                                so the first thing that happens is an                                article comes about and a journalist                                writes an article we it's it got sent to                                this robot which we call tagging service                                and it attached tags to this document                                and the document ends up in the web page                                and in the archive and there's this link                                between the archive and the robot and                                this is an important part of this slide                                because this is the only knowledge that                                robot has of the world this is the only                                link only outside knowledge that this                                 robot has and this is how the the web                                 page or where the keywords are shown you                                 see it's just a handful of them of                                 course there are many more in this                                 article but they're the user only gets                                 to see a handful but of course is not as                                 simple as I just explained and if people                                 are going to see these keywords you                                 cannot rely on a robot to to extract                                 this content because site has a                                 reputation to lose they cannot just let                                 the Machine and publish their content                                 without supervision and on the other                                 hand you can't just forget about the                                 machine and let the editors do that                                 completely freely because everyone has                                 their own ideas of what is the content                                 what what are the tags of this article I                                 just wrote and you want to have a bit of                                 a homogeneous landscape of keywords you                                 don't want em every article of this                                 particular editor to have a particular                                 set of keywords and the other editors                                 use another set of keywords so the                                 solution to this problem is to have a                                 curated list of keywords and to let the                                 editor pick a subset of the keywords                                 that are suggested for each article of                                 course curating this keyword list it is                                 extremely expensive but it's not a thing                                 that we can just forget and there's no                                 other way to do this because and                                 the risk is too high but going through a                                 large list of keyword candidates is also                                 something that is expensive I mean the                                 journalist writes the article and then                                 the job is done the journalist doesn't                                 want to go through the list a huge list                                 of keywords and decide which ones fit it                                 just wants to get to the next job and                                 it's the problem we we want to solve and                                 we're trying to solve the last month so                                 what's the feedback we got from the from                                 the journalists um after a few after two                                 years of the system running we had again                                 a talk with them and they they like it                                 actually quite a lot but they have of                                 course with the usage of it they have                                 come to gather feedback and one of the                                 important feedbacks we got was that on                                 the website it's more important it's                                 very important that the keywords are                                 highly relevant while on the archive                                 it's important that we have all keywords                                 that are a little cure in an archive in                                 an article because we want to be able to                                 link all possible articles more concrete                                 feedback just as examples and it's                                 important or they want rather to have                                 generic keywords than specific ones like                                 if you have Stuxnet and Stuxnet virus on                                 an article they want Stuxnet to be as a                                 keyword and not stuck stacked Stuxnet                                 virus and also one requirement was that                                 it would be very important to them that                                 if prison workers in an article NSA is                                 also a keyword even if it doesn't occur                                 in the article so this is a an expansion                                 of keywords for that that we should do                                 and they don't want to see also stop                                 keywords angular miracle and I mean site                                 is a serious newspaper they write a lot                                 about politics and economics and Angela                                 Merkel is is a curious and almost all                                 articles they write so they don't want                                 to have angular metal as an entity as a                                 relevant                                 word and all articles they have they                                 also don't want keywords that are that                                 are out of context so if there is a                                 something that is mentioned just as a on                                 the side of the article some argument                                 that is being made but it's not actually                                 the core of the article then this                                 shouldn't appear as a keyword and then                                 also they they they want that we                                 consider trends as one kind of defining                                 relevance so if at some point a guy                                 named Edward Snowden is psychics coated                                 a lot of times then he is probably                                 important we should we should show him                                 as an entity and on the archive of                                 course on the on this side and they want                                 to get everything and of course we                                 shouldn't any changes we do to the                                 system should not mean that the                                 journalists have more work to do this is                                 this is a hard requirement so if we                                 think about the problem of expanding to                                 similar keywords the first idea we had                                 was just to use knowledge bases or                                 cesare e and this is a no-go because                                 they don't want to have an editor                                 curating beside the whitelist also other                                 resources so the idea is to solve the                                 problem just like information retrieval                                 systems have you provide a ranking and                                 this is what we need because then you                                 show just the first part of the ranking                                 the first end keywords there the                                 relevant ranked keywords that the                                 journalist has to see and choose from                                 and we still have all other keywords on                                 the bottom of the list and we can't                                 attach them to the document in the                                 archive so that's what we we want to do                                 but a problem the first problem that you                                 are confronted with is to compare how do                                 you compare at different kinds of                                 keywords what's more important to have a                                 person be mentioned three times or a                                 statistical keyword with a score of                                     whatever this means so it's hard to                                 compare those stuffed so our idea was to                                 compute tf-idf of the tags                                 based on the archive so we simply                                 compute the document hit of each tag and                                 we can rely on our linguistic analyzers                                 to to find other forms of text that with                                 that we discovered in the document for                                 example in German you have this thing                                 that them probably most of you know that                                 you can compose words out of other words                                 and in this case bundesrat rafts                                 minister is this actually the same thing                                 as bonus with Minister favorite soft and                                 with our analyzers we can find both so                                 this is um this isn't cool and nice and                                 we use a losing similarity to compute                                 the tf-idf of each of each sex so it's                                 in this case it's a tag frequency                                 inverse document frequency and once we                                 have this we can sort we have a first                                 scoring of the text but of course tf-idf                                 might hurt context in this example here                                 so it's a dummy example of course m                                 ranch Tyga which is not a politician                                 he's a football player member of the                                 German national team he's probably out                                 of context in this document because he                                 occurs only once and and although all                                 the other tags are politicians so but                                 because site is focused more on politics                                 he gets a high tf-idf because you cure                                 is less in the rest of the archive ok so                                 how do we fix that the idea is to                                 compare the document we're processing                                 with other documents that contain this                                 tag so we compute the typical context of                                 attack and it's these context is kind of                                 a document and we compute the distance                                 between the document we are processing                                 at this point with the average document                                 that contains this tag and it's it's a                                 kind of a similarity actually the                                 context what we are comparing is and we                                 compare the tags that we extracted from                                 a document with the average tags that                                 cure with this in all documents that                                 have a mention of this one particular                                 tag                                 so this allows us to detect that                                 schweinsteiger in does not co-occur                                 frequently with the other tags we found                                 so we can either decrease his score or                                 increase the score of the others because                                 we detect that they are occurring in a                                 typical context and again this context                                 is also gathered from the archive that                                 we have so there's no other outside                                 knowledge and the nice thing about this                                 thing this technique and is that we can                                 use the same thing to expand to other                                 texts so we just need the the text that                                 we found in a document we search for all                                 of them for for all co-worker often                                 co-occurring tags with these other with                                 these tags and we can just pick the                                 first end that are not in our found text                                 set and then we have new text that                                 co-occur with this with these tags okay                                 but what if in this case in this example                                 in this dummy example what if                                 Schweinsteiger is not there incidentally                                 maybe it's World Cup time like we're                                 getting there in our definition in this                                 problem a trend is a measure of                                 variation of hit counts in our m archive                                 in our in a specific time stamp so we                                 can compute those trends quite easily                                 from the archive by counting the dif                                 different it counts and we get something                                 like this this is the trend for the                                 keyword Schweinsteiger in the year                                      and as you might have noticed there's a                                 huge bump here this is the world cup in                                 south africa the Green Line I think can                                 you see the green line it's the first                                 one here it's almost here this is when                                 balik the former german kappa captain                                 was hurt and then there was a public                                 discussion who should be the next                                 captain and Schweinsteiger was one of                                 the most prominent ones that should                                 substitute him and here starts the here                                 is the point when the world cup starts                                 and here's when it ends and here's the                                 last game of Germany so you see we can                                 compute these things it's not not magic                                 and having this trend we're able to                                 include it also in our scoring so now we                                 know maybe in this example that revenge                                 to its world cup time and shrine                                 schlager was quoted in a document okay                                 with lots of politics may be there                                 instrumental izing him and the world cup                                 to do politics that's something you use                                 very off you see very often and so this                                 is what we get at the end we have these                                 several scores there more of them these                                 are just three I showed and we score                                 each tag and then we have to somehow                                 combine these scores and the combination                                 is done by individually scaling them                                 onto us the same interval so that we can                                 actually compare them we then multiply                                 them by a weight each one of them this                                 is a configurable weight so that you can                                 if you want you can buy us your score                                 two towards one of these scores and then                                 you sum up and scale again so that you                                 have a a nice result and there is of                                 course a lot to configure and there is                                 no such thing as a perfect configuration                                 because a every person you will ask will                                 say did a different set of texts that                                 should be attached to the article so and                                 that's why we decided to give this                                 problem to side and they have the power                                 to configure it so they can't complain                                 if if it's if the ranking is not how                                 they they expect so what was this                                 summary and I think the important thing                                 is that the requirements in such an                                 editorial office are on a tagging system                                 are really complex i think this also                                 matches with what we heard in the first                                 keynote on technology transfer that I                                 mean when you hear in University about                                 an entity extraction you never hear                                 about stuff like this I mean that the                                 customer would want to have a ranking of                                 keywords I never heard of it before and                                 so it's it's there's much more work to                                 do then then what you you expect and and                                 that there is this trade-off between                                 relevance and completeness of texts                                 this is I think intrinsic because I                                 think for a thing to be relevant it has                                 to be not complete and for a thing to be                                 complete you have to include things that                                 are not relevant this is quite obvious                                 and you need both at least in this case                                 and we can solve it by using ranking and                                 I think the nicest thing is for all of                                 this from all these endpoints and this                                 is the thing that also justifies the the                                 title of the presentation as being a                                 high quality but low maintenance tagging                                 system is that we don't use any outside                                 resources we just use the archive that                                 keeps growing and we use it in to                                 bootstrap these cores and there's a lot                                 you can do to enrich text only by                                 looking at a representative set of                                 documents okay let's that's it thank you                                 okay I think we have time for maybe two                                 questions two quick questions there's                                 one I'm only here okay so you decide                                 which one you want to ask them yeah so                                 the first one is very simple how many                                 keywords do you have how many keywords                                 number of approved keywords oh this is a                                 thing that this is on the part of site                                 online and I would have to ask them but                                 it's it's a lot it's a lot                                              okay do you use the query log to inform                                 your your rankings and what queries etc                                 no there's there's no search in this in                                 this ranking the ranking is just and                                 that the journalist types an article and                                 gets a suggestions a suggestion of terms                                 that should be used as a metadata and                                 this this term list this tag list is                                 ranked on relevance but this relevance                                 has little to do with with search                                 relevance it's more of a semantic or                                 contextual relevance there are lots of                                 criteria i showed you three of them                                 which define if the keyword is relevant                                 or not okay hi I wanted to ask at some                                 point you show that you in fact had the                                 problem of finding correlations between                                 tags like and so do you solved by                                 analyzing the data and checking whether                                 one keyword would be mentioned with                                 other keyboard in mind documents no but                                 I was wondering I mean sometimes you                                 have this problem that one two keywords                                 can come up in the same document when                                 it's about oneness object and but                                 instead a different combination like AP                                 can be in this context but BLC can be on                                 another context and yeah the problem is                                 that in this kind of analysis you                                 basically lose the context you just                                 compute and trust some distances                                 and yeah I didn't know I was wondering                                 whether this was a problem in your case                                 or if it's thought about this or                                 anything no I'm I'm not sure I                                 understand what what you mean I                                 understand that you say that the words                                 can be ambiguous I guess that's what you                                 said that in one context if the word is                                 occurs in cold here's with another one                                 it means something and if it doesn't it                                 means something else yeah and of course                                 this is this is a problem but this works                                 quite well actually and because you use                                 we use this the one keyword to do a                                 search on the archive and then we get a                                 set of documents where this word occurs                                 or similar forms of this word occurs and                                 then we compute the average tags that                                 are present in these documents so we                                 have if you have a word like like Mars                                 which is a chocolate bar and the planet                                 and you will probably get all documents                                 that have a chocolate bar and a planet                                 so you won't be able to do to the                                 distinguish both and unless unless we                                 would use a more words or more tags from                                 our document to to get the score but we                                 try to keep things simple and it's I                                 don't think that that this would make                                 much difference but it's it's a nice                                 input actually thank you okay look well                                 again thank you very much okay                                 you
