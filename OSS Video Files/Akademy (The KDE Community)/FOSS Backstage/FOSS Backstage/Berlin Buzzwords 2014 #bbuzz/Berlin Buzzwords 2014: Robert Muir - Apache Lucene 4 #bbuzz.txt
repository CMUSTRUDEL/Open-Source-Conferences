Description: 
	Apache Lucene is an open-source search engine library written in Java. This talk will give an overview of its current capabilities.

This talk will give an up-to-date overview of Lucene's features. Many improvements have been added since the last revision of Lucene in Action (e.g. autosuggest and faceting), and many previous talks about these incremental improvements, but the idea is to summarize the current state of what Lucene can do.
