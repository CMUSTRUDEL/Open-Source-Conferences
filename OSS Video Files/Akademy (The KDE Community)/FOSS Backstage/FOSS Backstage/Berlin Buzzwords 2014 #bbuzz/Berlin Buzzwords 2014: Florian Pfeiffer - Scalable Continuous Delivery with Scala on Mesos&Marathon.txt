Description: 
	At one point a big blob of PHP doesn't fit your needs anymore. In this session you will hear everything about the pain we had at gutefrage.net when we decided to move from a monolithic php application to a service orientated scala/finagle infrastructure. 

You'll hear about our great idea to scale with VMs on our private cloud and you'll hear why we realized that this idea was crap. But you will also see how we've moved from VMs to Mesos&Marathon and how we now manage to get our stuff on production in a fully automated continuous delivery environment.
