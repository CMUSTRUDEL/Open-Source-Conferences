                             person behind the camera he's down there                                and he's done a really good job last                                year made me made it very

                          some of these people are here as well                                and this is the this is the the program                                the program committee those people                                helped us to select all the talks I                                think we had a hundred and thirty                                submissions this year and it's always                                very hard the that process is as tough                                there's a lot of stuff to review without                                these guys it wouldn't be possible thank                                you and also thank you for submitting i                                think is this even more important like                                without the speakers you know nobody                                would come so thank you again                                and thank you for coming this is maybe                                the most important thing I think this is                                this was by at least for me the most                                relaxed conference I think Isabel also                                had a really good time and I last year I                                have a lot of people saying like you                                know this didn't work and that didn't                                work I did like the weather I think we                                fixed that this year thank you again                                thank you sis one thing to fix for next
