Publication date: 2014-05-28
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2014 #bbuzz
Description: 
	ElasticSearch is a great product - for search, for scale, for analyzing data, and much more. But sometimes you need to do something that is not supported by ElasticSearch out of the box, and that's where plugins come into play.

Join me in this talk to explore the plugins land of ElasticSearch. We will discuss the various ways ElasticSearch can be extended, and the various types of plugins available to do that. By giving concrete examples and browsing the large selection of pre-made plugins, we will see how plugins can help us overcome various challenges. We will also discuss possible issues with plugins, and ways to work around them.

Finally, we will discuss scenarios in which custom plugin development is necessary and can really save the day. By showing a demo of one such scenario, and the way we built and debugged a plugin to solve it, we will complete the picture of the ElasticSearch plugin land, and hopefully inspire you to create your own!
