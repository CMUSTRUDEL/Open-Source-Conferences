Description: 
	When Apache Hadoop was first introduced to the Open Source, it was focused on implementing Google's Map/Reduce, a framework for batch processing of very large files in a distributed system. Built for running on large cluster of commodity hardware, Hadoop also included a cluster resource manager to divide the capacity of the cluster between the various Map/Reduce jobs that can run at a given time.

A Hadoop cluster, however, is not always fully utilized, and idle resources would best be used for other compute-intensive tasks like real-time stream processing, message passing, or graph algorithms. Unfortunately, the cluster resource manager was specialized in Map/Reduce execution and did not allow other types of workloads.
