Title: Daniel Guagnin – There is no such thing as bias-free tech. How models shape our world.

Description: 
	Since prominent cases of racist and sexist „artifical intelligence“ have got medial attention, the term of biased algorithms is more widely discussed. However the term bias sometimes is understood as something that can be overcome easily by gaining more or „better“ data. I want to argue why the term „bias“ and its implication of potentially „unbiased“ technology is fundamentally misleading. For that I will connect the concept of model and modelification from computer science with sociological insights from science and technology studies. This illustrates how individual conceptions and necessary limitations of concrete use cases lead to restrictions of the models underlying the further technical development, which are rarely contested later on.

After that, drawing on sociology of technology, I will discuss how technology shapes individual action and society at large in order to stress the importance of evaluating and rethinking technical configurations and the specific biases and shortcomings of the models algorithms and technological are based on.

For the illustration of how specific values shape the development of software and the software shapes its users, I will revisit empirical examples of the linux communities Arch, Debian and Ubuntu. As a second case I will discuss model assumptions of the Android permission management which strongly frame possibilities of app developers and the personal privacy management of the users.

Based on empirical examples the talk illustrates the politics of technology and explains the underlying mechanisms in order to underline the responsibility which follows process of construction.

	                              good evening i'm very glad                               to be here what's this talk about                               the word bias makes us think there is                               such thing as                               unbiased data or technology but i want                               to argue that rather it is about the                               abstraction                               and the conscious or unconscious                               implications we inscribe                                into the models the models we use to                                build our technologies                                in the process of construction                                finally our perspectives of the world                                become part                                of technology that in the end shapes our                                perception                                and behavior and the working of the                                world                                who am i um this is not me                                but i might have looked similarly                                irritated                                when one day i opened ebay and i was                                advertised hipster fashionware                                for a moment i really started to think                                is this what i am have i become a                                hipster without realizing it                                or am i a wannabe hipster do i want to                                be one                                there are nice classes and has offered                                here then                                the analytical self came up is the data                                wrong                                what did i look for that makes ebay                                think i'm hipster                                or was my flatmate on my computer or                                do they target our common ip address                                i still don't know but the crucial point                                is                                tech is not perfect data models make                                errors                                but still this affects us                                in my case it brought me to                                self-reflection and                                made me think if i should be more open                                to fashion                                but more sure than about my fashion i'm                                about my profession                                so i did some research on data                                protection privacy since                                     consultancy since                                                computer science background                                and i did a doctoral thesis about                                sociology                                about open source software communities                                in sociology of technology                                and science                                so back to the biases besides                                my targeted advertisement advertisement                                experience                                there are more severe cases of wrong                                data models                                just some headlines to illustrate some                                prominent cases                                you might heard from                                amazon's crabs secret ai recruiting tool

             we may face dysfunctional effects of                                technology design                                illegitimate automated decisions                                questionable incentives to act and                                to behave and                                importantly technology is often                                conceived as neutral                                such as mathematics and the combination                                of a neutral perception and strong                                technological efficiency                                can bring injustice which is inscribed                                in the model                                and comes to a large scale                                but what's the matter with broken data                                models                                data models are shaped by the selection                                of data by the availability of data what                                can be measured in the first place for                                instance                                by validity or by history since data                                always is taken from the past and                                real life is often already unfair                                there might be others i don't want to go                                much                                uh too much too deep into that                                what can be the solution more data                                better data                                 i propose a more reflexive technology                                 construction                                 because it's not only the data models                                 it's more than that models can be very                                 concrete like a crash test dummy                                 a model of the human body with a                                 standardized shape                                 and weight of a man                                 it turns out that this model taken from                                 a standard man                                 led to safety design which makes cars                                 less                                 safe for women many implications are                                 kind of unconscious                                 often we just use an eye methodology to                                 conceptualize the working of technology                                 and unconsciously include our subjective                                 worldview and                                 to illustrate what i mean with                                 subjectivity i brought to you                                 an example                                 it's an example taken from michel                                 foucault's

logic our perception of how                                 things                                 are are deeply cultural                                 but there are also decisions and                                 limitations made on purpose                                 these limitations often are helpful to                                 fulfill                                 a specific goal in the process of                                 modeling                                 assumptions are made decisions are taken                                 between options                                 which limit future possibilities                                 in the process of modeling an important                                 question is also who has to say                                 in taking decisions on which basis                                 decisions                                 are made these models here are useful to                                 demonstrate the construction of a boat                                 or to measure the flow resistance but                                 they cannot necessarily swim                                 they are not the product itself                                 so during the process of technology                                 construction the assumptions and

  here you see how a development team                                 simulates                                 situations for a detection algorithm                                 they build a model for the situations                                 for the recognition of falls of seniors                                 in such scenarios developers define                                 which situations should be significant                                 for an alarm which requires thorough                                 reasoning since those definitions are                                 key                                 for the recognition rate and the use of                                 the technology in the end                                 it might even risk or save lives                                 to recognize a fallen senior or not                                 models in it conceptualize key parts of                                 the software                                 like the data structure or classes of                                 programs                                 they later become become part of the                                 software                                 other than the ship models we saw before                                 those models are already an integral                                 part of the end product                                 limitations and abstractions implicated                                 will often not be challenged again but                                 flow directly into software code                                 the model is already the product here                                 let me now come to how technology can                                 take effect on behavior                                 consciously beyond implicit assumptions                                 and necessary limitations for models                                 technologies                                 also be designed to script behavior                                 let me give you two very illustrative                                 textbook examples of science and                                 technology studies                                 speed bumps are a technology                                 which leads people to drive slowly                                 not because they take care of playing                                 children but because they take care of                                 their car                                 a very funny object is the berlin keys                                 it's a simple object but a great example                                 of how technology can script a whole                                 user choreography it's a key                                 which sticks in the door while the door                                 is open                                 so once the door is opened you can't get                                 out                                 your key you                                 have to push the key through the hole                                 go inside and shut the door again                                 to get back your key otherwise you don't                                 have the key                                 so this is designed to                                 take care that the door of a house                                 stays closed                                 it's a very simple object but a very                                 complex                                 choreography which is designed in                                 technology so back to the digital                                 at least the beginning of the who knows                                 dvds                                 these many many might                                 these video discs shipped with region                                 keys in order to enforce the publication                                 date of movies                                 dvds from us for instance could not be                                 played on a european dvd player                                 because the region code did not fit                                 today digital rights management is much                                 more elaborated in streaming services                                 but it shows how behavior or how the use                                 of technology can                                 be shaped by its design                                 another example for nudging users                                 you can find in cookie banners                                 at least in europe you are confronted                                 with so-called                                 dark patterns on a daily basis since                                 companies are obliged                                 to oblige to limit the use of personal                                 data they try to nudge users                                 to consent to a broad range of data                                 collection                                 i know this is no black or white but                                 from a user perspective this is                                 really a pain these are examples of                                 influencing users                                 in their way of using technology but                                 this is                                 conscious modeling of user action or                                 scripting the way                                 people interact with technology                                 with a number of sociologists i worked                                 on a concept                                 on conceptualizing the science and                                 technology studies                                 idea of moral inscription                                 if we think of influencing user                                 interaction                                 we have two opportunities to change her                                 aims                                 or her opportunities                                 the first way for changing users aims                                 is just information in order to change                                 her interpretation for instance we can                                 give information why cookies make sense                                 and give a better user experience but we                                 can also change the resources and give                                 an inducement                                 cookies cookie banners for instance who                                 are                                 ignored and just stay until you accept                                 and until you accept                                 you can't see anything from the page                                 you're visiting at the moment                                 then we can change the resources                                 through offering or not offering options                                 for instance                                 that would be the provision of resources                                 you can have loads of options or                                 can offer to to opt in every                                 one of the thousand cookies                                 or everything at one click for instance                                 so the cookie itself is a resource for                                 interaction                                 and question would be if you can only                                 proceed                                 after you clicked accept or if you just                                 have one single button                                 saying okay in the example of a cookie                                 banner                                 this shouldn't makes too much of sense                                 but                                 i experienced banners which seem to keep                                 me in the loop until i finally accept it                                 there might be no option to not accept                                 in some cases                                 what is cast now can be illustrated as a                                 constructionist model                                 together with a colleague pola i drafted                                 a concept                                 to combine the computer science view of                                 models with the sociological view of                                 inscription                                 to illustrate the way we bring                                 limitations and assumptions in                                 technology                                 and shape the world through its                                 application                                 models are an abstraction of the problem                                 with a purpose                                 and a plan for a solution                                 in the process of construction this                                 materializes                                 into artifacts like protocols code or                                 libraries                                 each of these bricks entails again                                 assumptions and limitations                                 step by step the technologies combined                                 by parts and bricks with limitations and                                 assumptions                                 finally these become invisible in the                                 final product                                 but the system takes effect in its                                 application                                 into the world                                 so let me get more practical as promised                                 in a talk description                                 let me very shortly give you two                                 examples of my empirical work                                 the installed routines of three linux                                 distributions tell a lot about their                                 user view                                 um they may be                                 a wizard which let you install the                                 system without any hassle                                 or they may be the installer may be a                                 simple menu which gives you                                 loads of options                                 or you have the whole power of the                                 command line but you need to learn                                 how to get the single steps of the                                 installation                                 done on your own                                 um remarkably this different modeling of                                 of the user                                 and the user experience um is already                                 implicated in the                                 in the slogan of of the distributions                                 debian comes as the universal operating                                 system                                 ubuntu is the linux for human beings                                 and our clinox comes as a simple                                 lightweight                                 distribution you can also find this                                 in what i call the rdfm policy                                 which you can find in the community                                 practices and the policies                                 for instance users might say saying rdfm                                 is not cool                                 not following the code of conduct or                                 the project leader says when the code is                                 public rtfm is the proper answer                                 document it properly afterwards                                 or people might say rtfm helps                                 the noob you can also find                                 this uh in the social structures of the                                 community that i have to skip that                                 for reasons of the time another                                 illustration of the power of models can                                 be found in the android permission model                                 which changed in android                                    in the old model users could see all                                 permissions of an app                                 before the installation install time                                 permissions                                 in the new model users could opt in                                 every single permission                                 wait every single permission no                                 part of the new model was that a number                                 of permissions were defined as                                 normal permissions which need no                                 interaction                                 for instance the internet access of the                                 app is always granted                                 which research found to be a category                                 user's experience is sensible and would                                 like to control                                 since internet access means the app can                                 also transfer                                 sensible data to remote service                                 interestingly by now while in our                                 project we worked on making permission                                 dialogues easier to understand                                 apple came up with new dialogues                                 also interesting is that our research                                 showed that people were                                 surprised to realize how much                                 information the location data exactly                                 meant                                 when they saw the illustration of their                                 movements on the map                                 so information awareness can make a                                 difference here                                 and let me add the model                                 of the permission model                                 is a strong definition of what you can                                 do as an                                 application developer still you can                                 write something in the dialogues but the                                 permission model is                                 already fixed by the model                                 of the ecosystem so                                 in conclusion ids ideas become                                 materialized                                 into models and implemented or                                 inscribed into technology it's much more                                 than biased data                                 it's our view on the world it's                                 assumptions and limitations in every                                 brick                                 of the technology it's the culture of                                 the developers                                 all this shapes technology and takes                                 effect on the world                                 through user interaction but also                                 through computations and decisions                                 which are made or suggested by                                 algorithms                                 it's a continuous process to keep in                                 mind the responsibility of technology                                 construction                                 and find ways to reflect and challenge                                 assumptions limitations and the effects                                 it takes in every step of development                                 thanks for listening i'm looking forward                                 to questions                                 and the paper will follow soon                                 you
