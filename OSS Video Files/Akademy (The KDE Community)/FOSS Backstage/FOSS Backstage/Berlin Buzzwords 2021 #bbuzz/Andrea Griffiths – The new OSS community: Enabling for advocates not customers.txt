Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Built and maintained by people like you, open source software powers the global economy. Sustainability of this ecosystem is pivotal to accelerate human progress; yet many organizations focus their community building efforts as a sales pipeline, or a program to deflect requests for support. 
In this talk I’d share tools to engage your communities in a positive, nurturing way; with a servants approach to building community and centered on creating advocacy, loyalty, and ultimately business value.

                  all right so let's get started in                                 colombia there is a saying                                 um it's                                 and roughly translates to basically                                 if you open up a shop if you own a shop                                 um                                 you should look after it there is a                                 humongous misconception out there                                 that all it takes for you to create                                 nurture grow a community that's going to                                 be productive                                 and enhance your product and your users                                 experience                                 is doing just that creating a space                                 slapping on a slack channel this score                                 discourse instance                                 whatever it is and people will just                                 flock to it they will just come                                 and that's not necessarily the case                                 we're going back to the                                 tienda analogy um                                 you have to tend to it you have to                                 nurture it you have to                                 engage with empathy um building a                                 community                                 is as much about driving the success                                 of your business and the bottom line of                                 your company of course                                 as much as it is promoting and enabling                                 your customers to be successful                                 at using your product at accomplishing                                 what they're trying to do when they                                 decided that                                 your product your feature your research                                 paper                                 that's what they wanted to invest their                                 time in so                                 keep that in mind this is true both for                                 users                                 of products as well as members of the                                 open source                                 community and whether it be maintainers                                 or contributors you have to tend to your                                 garden so if you can attend                                 and how do we do that so                                 the reality of it is that in the advent                                 of covet                                 um we've been forced to work a bit                                 differently now                                 the way that we engage our communities                                 via open source communities or our                                 communities of customers                                 it's not the same and it shouldn't be we                                 we                                 can um count on in-person events                                 we can't count on those hotel-lovia                                 conference interactions that sometimes                                 spark the best                                 ideas no we have to adapt                                 we have to adapt to the now and we have                                 to adapt to the fact that                                 now more than ever every company has                                 been forced to become a software company                                 so regardless of what business you are                                 in                                 um to survive this pandemic and the                                 constraints of it                                 you must have engaged into software                                 uh either creating a website or the way                                 that you engage your customers etc even                                 something as simple as                                 selling your goods through a marketplace                                 online                                 this means you are now a software                                 company doesn't matter if you sell                                 popsicles                                 or if you are creating the next big                                 software                                 tool for developers so what can we do we                                 can embrace this opportunity now                                 and with this challenge comes the                                 opportunity that we can now reach a                                 global audience                                 and provide spaces for collaboration                                 exponentially um we're now more

              so of course this is not something that                                 happens overnight you can't just                                 again open a shop and expect people to                                 flock to it                                 so i'm going to share with you a few                                 things that i've                                 done in the past that i've been able to                                 empower communities                                 to lean to harness that power and to                                 help improve the                                 way that they interact growth scale                                 their products so                                 let's take a look at what we can do to                                 get there                                 so let's focus first of all in                                 scaling and retention um                                 if you are in any kind of business                                 regardless of what it is                                 and you know that it costs a lot more to                                 acquire a new customer user community                                 member                                 contributor however you want to call                                 them a new human that comes to use your                                 product or                                 that wants to bet on you is harder to                                 acquire than it is to retain                                 so in order to retain our users to keep                                 our community members engaged                                 to keep those people who downloaded your                                 product                                 using it and we have to build a strong                                 culture                                 and you very much can begin today to                                 start doing this                                 shifting culture and you can do that                                 and all of these things are going to                                 lead into enabling for advocacy                                 and not so much for customers eventually                                 of course silver lining they will become                                 your customers                                 um but some of the ways that you can do                                 this include of course                                 listening is so important talk to                                 maintainers talk to contributors                                 talk to the person that just installed                                 your application or just visited your                                 website or subscribe to your newsletter                                 talk to them reach out                                 and then be quiet simply listen to their                                 experience                                 sometimes we are looking or working on a                                 product for so long that                                 we tend to lose sight about that user                                 experience for a first-time user                                 or someone who is maybe not as technical                                 as you are or doesn't understand the                                 concepts                                 because they're not as you know together                                 in it as you have been                                 in order to do that and do it                                 effectively we need to do it with                                 empathy                                 so don't make assumptions um go into                                 these conversations with an open mind                                 and keeping in mind that you're doing                                 this because you want to listen                                 and learn another thing that we can do                                 whether

folks to get excited about doing                                 this type of extra                                 but i promise you when you give that                                 white glove treatment                                 to your users when you focus on those                                 customer stories                                 when you're inspired you build those                                 relationships you're going to be on the                                 right track to create some fierce fierce                                 loyal users                                 and so what happens when we apply all of                                 these things well it's really exciting                                 because we are now                                 at the level of authenticity at a scale                                 and what does that mean                                 of course if i answer a question to you                                 via                                 a personal message um that might have                                 answered your question                                 you now have the answer you need it if i                                 answer your question in a public forum                                 um now i help countless individuals who                                 might have the same questions so                                 keep that in mind that is a good way to                                 scale practices                                 when it comes to either updates to your                                 product or just use a research                                 figuring out what's working what's not                                 when you do these things                                 you focus on nurturing your users it's                                 authentic                                 you earn their loyalty and so you                                 and this user obsessed culture helps us                                 create user advocates                                 so what happens then um you have your                                 users                                 and they love everything you're doing                                 they love how responsive you are they                                 become your fans                                 they become your advocates and then                                 ultimately                                 um the true north they become your user                                 advocates they become                                 the folks that are talking about your                                 product they're sharing it on their

   traditional support paths                                 and there are many many um across                                 organizations that you have and                                 value add by being a community-minded                                 person                                 open source-minded person and what do i                                 mean by that                                 this is the job of everyone and the                                 value proposition                                 affects everyone from sales and because                                 again                                 that can be a huge business                                 differentiator if i                                 am looking for a product where i'm a                                 gigantic company or a startup                                 and i find a product of course this is a                                 personal take                                 that has a really strong community                                 support or leans into an open source                                 project that has a fantastic welcoming                                 community i probably lean more towards                                 using that versus one                                 that is entirely business to business                                 why because i know if there is an issue                                 there will be more eyes than those of                                 the developers who are developing the                                 product                                 so i know i can reach them directly and                                 provide feedback from my particular use                                 cases                                 so for sales you will sell more                                 for uses to sex of course less attrition                                 sometimes we lose customers and users of                                 our products to things that are                                 so just elemental in a simple                                 email a simple message on a forum could                                 help us retain our customers so                                 again it costs a lot more to get a new                                 one so let's invest in retaining the                                 ones that we have                                 let's reduce that churn um and then for                                 product and product people like myself                                 what an incredible opportunity you have                                 to listen to your users gather that                                 feedback                                 and actually put it to action actually                                 do the things that your users are asking                                 for                                 that doesn't mean you're going to take                                 every single suggestion from the                                 community and apply it to your product                                 of course                                 but this will really enhance the scope                                 in which you're looking at your roadmap                                 and the decision-making process and when                                 you are                                 prioritizing so product                                 teams you're also winning with your                                 community in open source minded                                 and finally for marketing i mean this is                                 doing the job                                 of a thousand marker to fry um                                 watermelon                                 is the best advertisement and i                                 you know when you have a recommendation                                 from a peer you take it maybe a bit more                                 too hard than you would if it's                                 something that you just found in a                                 random                                 google search so i want to talk to you a                                 little bit more                                 from the product perspective about                                 adoption                                 and this is a very old debate goodie                                 and it's called um the pirate metric                                 theory                                 it's called that because um if you spell                                 it phonetically it sounds                                 r well this was uh created by a                                 gentleman who's much smarter than i am                                 dave mcclure and basically he wanted to                                 focus the way that                                 young companies and startups were                                 just prioritizing their efforts figuring                                 out what metrics to look at when it came                                 to engagement                                 when it came to adoption when it came to                                 revenue and product                                 um i very much appreciate this as a                                 product person myself                                 and because it leans heavily on data and                                 when you lean on data the numbers don't                                 lie you're able to take a look at your                                 metrics for                                 awareness acquisition activation                                 retention                                 referrals revenue and then you can take                                 all of this quantitative data and apply                                 it to a way that would enhance the                                 experience of your users                                 or would increase your awareness will                                 help you retain                                 folks using your platform etc so                                 please take a look at that even if you                                 are not a product person                                 this is a really really good way to take                                 a look at what metrics matter and what                                 you should be looking at when you're                                 having these interactions                                 it helps you lean into those community                                 um opportunities                                 very well so there's a short link there                                 you have that code                                 forward slash pirate and actually the                                 folks                                 have way did a really cool youtube video                                 explaining                                 these principles they are pirate metrics                                 and um i recommend you watch it so that                                 you can learn a bit more about                                 how to and what measuring matters when                                 it comes to community                                 okay and let's see again                                 cross organizational proposition i think                                 i went forward let's go back                                 um we can also not forget about open                                 source                                 let's not forget about fostering that                                 obsession giving mark                                 back to the open source community um and                                 i like to think about it uh with                                 something that is called the                                 uh servant mind the serbian mindset                                 um you know a lot of companies talked                                 about                                 uh contributing to open source or                                 sustainability of open source or                                 um helping open source projects and it's                                 very talked about it's very promoted                                 lots of buzzwords right um                                 but you need to really take a moment to                                 stop and conscientiously examine exactly                                 what you as an individual                                 or your company uh what are you doing to                                 ensure the supportability of the                                 projects that your                                 product is using or the ones that you're                                 using yourself what are you doing are                                 you contributing                                 if you're not what's keeping you from                                 doing it um                                 let's look at it from the servant's                                 point of view and                                 i love this definition because um it's                                 full of humility                                 it's full of empowerment uplifting                                 servant leadership means that my                                 motivations was important to me                                 yes it matters but it's really not as                                 important                                 as the scale right so                                 not just helping one person but helping                                 thousands                                 and the beauty of open source is that we                                 can all contribute we can all be part of                                 these wonderful communities                                 and we can all help each other get where                                 we need to go                                 so take a moment to reflect on what                                 you're doing                                 and i encourage everyone to get started                                 if they are not                                 and once we do a few of the things that                                 i've mentioned                                 we're gonna hit a point where we start                                 thinking well                                 am i doing this right does that mean now                                 that i have a successful community                                 does that mean now that i am in a modern                                 community                                 and and one of the ways that you can                                 really evaluate this                                 of course the adoption of metrics                                 fantastic you can take a look at                                 the arp theories and pick the evaluation                                 metrics that matter to you that matter                                 to your organization                                 but at a more high level really the                                 simplest way is to take a look at your                                 user success currency and what does that                                 mean                                 you know the currency of your users that                                 you have that you can gain is their                                 trust                                 when someone downloads your platform                                 your app                                 when someone contributes to your project                                 they are setting up their trust in you                                 and your abilities in your product                                 and that trust is absolutely                                 priceless currency if you have                                 uh increased engagement if you have lots                                 of adoption                                 that means you have trust so hey success                                 currency                                 user love of course yes i am telling all                                 my friends i'm telling my colleagues                                 hey come check out this product this is                                 great the community is friendly                                 um there are many ways that i can                                 provide feedback                                 um they are actually engaging in                                 authentic ways                                 it isn't a one-way street they're                                 listening they're giving back                                 and all of this is going to lead to that                                 fierce loyalty that we all                                 want and i think anyone that takes pride                                 in the work                                 really finds that rewarding when they                                 feel like their product                                 is beloved and that you have people who                                 really depend on it because they                                 they understand that um it is the best                                 solution for them right so                                 um keep in mind this uh currencies which                                 might not be tied to metrics                                 um there might be a bit more high level                                 altruistic but i think that they can                                 work for you as well                                 so let's go ahead and start wrapping it                                 up and i apologize i went a bit                                 over time here to get to the point of                                 the new community                                 just some key points to remember um i                                 want you to be                                 a little bit like that um fella in the                                 graphic who's kind of holding                                 up the open source or logo and just this                                 is where a bit of the heavy lifting                                 happens right this is when you need to                                 really reflect on the things that matter                                 what's important                                 so remember each person you're watching                                 you have the power to nurture you have

surprise and                                 delight your users                                 um i constantly tell folks when                                 i either attend the meet up or uh i'm                                 invited to a                                 speaking event for the engagement that                                 whether there is one person

             really delight                                 users to really have those personal                                 connections                                 and it's not um a one-way street it's                                 not for them                                 only i also gained so much knowledge                                 um and just so many incredible
