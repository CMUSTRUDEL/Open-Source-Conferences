Title: Lucian Precup – Beyond Artificial Intelligence for Search
Publication date: 2021-06-24
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	It is proven that for relatively well-structured data, like in e-commerce for example, a hand tailored search configuration can easily outperform machine learning approaches for relevance. The search configuration considers the different searchable fields, a business taxonomy and ontology, some domain related synonyms, a few specific landing pages, boosts and some business numerical criteria.

In the same way, we describe an approach for relevance in the case of large-scale search engines which is not based on classical "PageRank" and machine learning approaches. We propose a model based on social interactions between communities and individuals that are using or configuring the search engine. We then compare this model with machine learning powered approaches.

	                              hello berlin buzzwords thanks for the                               great introduction                               and uh thank you for for organizing this                               conference so                               so well for the second time in in                               virtually thanks for bringing the                               community together again                               and i hope to just to see you in person                               sometime                                soon so uh you expect to talk about                                artificial intelligence in this talk it                                would be quick because we'd only have                                five minutes                                so first what is ai is machine learning                                ai is this cubic polynomial regression                                ai                                some might say that this linear                                regression is a i                                or maybe is powerpoint ai                                well um let's go to search engines                                because yeah this is what we do                                all search engines work in a similar way                                they perform                                three basic tasks they examine the                                content they have permission to see                                that's the crawling they examine each                                piece                                of of content that's indexing                                and they decide which content is more                                useful to the searchers                                that's ranking um                                well when it comes to ranking this is                                where we plug the                                all the ai stuff there and yeah                                everybody says that this ranking is our                                secret sauce it's                                top secret uh you have a lot of                                buzzwords there you have ai powered                                search you have a                                neural source you have machine learning                                deep learning data science                                well something that trey granger's uh                                trade ranger used to call                                buzzword salad okay no offense buzzwords                                but yeah                                this is what it is um let's take this                                from another perspective from the                                perspective of a                                business user of a search engine                                administrator                                we actually helped we built and we                                helped building a lot of e-commerce uh                                search search engines and                                we came to a conclusion when it comes to                                relevance uh                                you have if you have an option between a                                fine relevance tuning                                and automatic automated relevance tuning                                well when you talk about e-commerce data                                which is                                highly structured you have a lot of                                tools at your disposal you have boost                                you                                have function scores you have synonyms                                you have redirections you have courier                                writing                                you can work on user experience you can                                plug                                business rules or business needs in                                there                                how about learning to rank uh so yeah ai                                machine learning                                you have the ranking model you have the                                learning algorithm and you have the                                training data                                but actually our conclusion is that this                                is very expensive to implement properly                                you have you need a lot of maintenance                                there and you have a lot of technical                                depth                                and if your model is not properly                                trained that's                                worth and                                last but not least you have a black box                                there                                and you cannot explain easily explain to                                the business                                why do you have this result why this                                first and this                                this this one second um                                yes um so yeah what what do do others do                                so you certainly have heard about both                                which is google's                                new ai algorithm that that that powers                                google                                well actually board helps only                                       in                                                                     do not use board                                do not need board do not need ai                                 um of course ten percent it's a lot                                 but yeah you have to have the                                 time and the money to optimize this                                    percent there                                 it's only                                                             the e-commerce space algolia that                                 released a new ai platform                                 when you look into it actually besides                                 nlp and llu which i do not discuss here                                 we'll see later uh it resumes to dynamic                                 synonyms personalization and                                 bring your own ai okay so plug your own                                 model                                 and hope for the best it's actually                                 amazon that understood this                                 better uh they created this mechanical                                 turk                                 which is a an automaton uh                                 which is a human-powered                                 robot actually yes so                                 don't get us wrong we do                                 use ai and we do think ai                                 is useful but we mostly use it in these                                 parts crawling and indexing so you can                                 use it for                                 it's it fits for automatic document                                 classification from document clustering                                 for dynamic synonym suggestion                                 for data cleaning because if you have                                 garbage in you have garbage out so yeah                                 everything which is the                                 noise in the data like like ocr for                                 example                                 uh machine learning is fits                                 well to to clean that of course                                 everything that's around nlp and                                 you in a natural language like a voice                                 search chat bots                                 question answering yeah ai fits best and                                 also to some extent in ranking when you                                 deal with highly unstructured data                                 now if we see how the current models                                 work                                 um so uh this one is from google                                 it's powered by advertising a lot                                 by seo money to some extent a lot also                                 uh you have some ai there in the                                 questions part                                 uh so uh you cannot see it well but if                                 if you                                 go to this url you you will see that                                 it's also powered by compliance that                                 means that                                 if you comply to the rules imposed by                                 by google then you will get to the first                                 page                                 and it has a lot of personalization                                 probably if you go to this page you will                                 have some                                 different display than than i                                 i have and in e-commerce                                 this one is for amazon from amazon you                                 kind of have the same thing                                 you have advertising to some extent you                                 have partnerships that appear on the                                 first                                 first page are not boosted you have                                 compliance those that                                 comply with the rules of the marketplace                                 and they have                                 they are well noted and all that you                                 have also personalization                                 now if we go to something new                                 that's beyond artificial intelligence we                                 kind of                                 observed that social networks have a                                 quite interesting model so of course you                                 have to                                 some some kind of ai there because in                                 your twitter feed in your youtube field                                 you have some data that's displayed                                 there for a reason                                 so yeah you have maybe some machine                                 learning you have some advertising of                                 course                                 but especially you have content                                 that's there because people you follow                                 find find find that interesting                                 you also have some content that comes                                 from people around you                                 but mainly uh your relevance model is                                 influenced by the people you follow                                 and this brings us to what we have tried                                 to implement                                 in our collaborative search engine that                                 you can find at                                 all that site which is                                 it kind of brings all these together so                                 yeah all                                 have that you have seen um you get                                 results that should                                 just as you have you get in google they
