               in the questions window i think it will                                be the easiest way to do this                                also feel free to uh bring your ideas                                your comments your suggestions                                and i'm going to start off with some                                questions of my own for lars                                we'll take more of your questions toward                                the end we may interrupt part way                                through                                let's just see where this whole thing                                takes us now i want to do                                a little more of a a formal introduction                                uh to lars and i realized one of the                                questions i should have asked him ahead                                of time                                is how to pronounce uh the name of his                                company                                oh i should introduce myself for a                                moment of                                my role as principal technologists at                                hewlett-packard working with                                hpe esmerald data fabric some of you                                will have known that technology                                was built on what was formerly the map                                our                                data platform before map r was acquired                                by hpe                                so i tend to focus more on the data side                                of things i think lars                                looks not only at the data but                                especially at computation but mainly                                he's got that                                huge amount of real world experience so                                lars my first questions for you                                are how do you pronounce your company                                correctly                                well you are the founder i believe in                                the the ceo of this company                                this is a long question it's got four                                parts                                and tell us a little bit about the work                                that you're doing now but                                also what brought you to this what were                                the                                the journey that got you there yeah um                                 well i shouldn't i shouldn't uh take my                                 my whole life history here but there are                                 a couple of milestones who                                 who took me here and and the company                                 name is                                 skling by the way i realized that every                                 every company name has                                 has some kind of drawback you know it                                 means something dirty in some language                                 or something in my case it's or in our                                 case it's                                 people don't know to pronounce whether                                 you pronounce it with a soft c or the                                 hard seed but it's a hard scene                                 it's clean um and what brought me here                                 uh there are a couple of milestones in                                 my career that like                                 brought me here uh the first one was was                                 in                                      uh when i got lucky and was able to join                                 google as one of the first engineers in                                 stockholm                                 and we built uh was called google talk                                 video at the time                                 for the first video conferencing at                                 google we're now in the third generation                                 i think which is meat                                 and uh that was revolutionary                                 or they became a realized                                 or an eye opener for me and not because                                 of video conferencing but because i                                 realized how much value you can get out                                 of the                                 data google sort of invented big data                                 and they were the only ones doing it at                                 the time                                 um so as when i left google i tried to                                 gravitate towards data as much as                                 possible and what i didn't know when i                                 was at google was that                                 was that spotify had just installed                                 their first hadoop cluster back in                                       uh it was just five machines beneath the                                 window                                 and uh so i joined a few spotify a few                                 years later and                                 built uh sort of one of the generations                                 of the spotify                                 internal data platform the the one where                                 we managed to go from just a few teams                                 being able to use hadoop and use data to                                 democratizing                                 in it in the in the whole company and                                 the use of data                                 completely exploded at spotify                                 afterwards and they're still                                 sort of the the leader in terms of data                                 maturity and data usage in                                 scandinavia um                                 i my mission ever since has been to                                 spread                                 the value the superpowers that that like                                 data and ai brings                                 to to uh to companies to as                                 swedish or unscandinavian companies that                                 that i like                                 whose values i sympathize with and that                                 good things uh for for for the society                                 at large or for the environment uh                                 not necessarily non-profit but just have                                 good values that i that i                                 sort of agree with and i for for a                                 number of years i tried to do that as a                                 freelance consultant                                 and i realized there is so much only so                                 much you can do because success with                                 data                                 is not about the the technology or the                                 tools of the machinery and usually i was                                 brought in to build machinery uh                                 basically and build a data platform for                                 us uh                                 and so forth but it lies in the in the                                 ways that you work with data in how you                                 collaborate and and how you extract                                 value and so forth so so i                                 was often accompanist and saying well i                                 can build things for you but you                                 actually need                                 you know an organizational culture an                                 agile culture someone to transform the                                 way that you work and you and that's                                 what                                 effectively limits you                                 so uh we are now trying a different                                 approach                                 where we uh collaborate uh with                                 companies                                 but in a different form so we're                                 providing what we call data value as a                                 service and it's                                 it's essentially a jointly operated                                 data factory uh where we                                 help clients extract value from their                                 data                                 uh by uh channeling their data to our                                 platform and we build the                                 pipelines and refine it and if the                                 domain is                                 is complex uh then we uh we collaborate                                 very closely with the domain experts                                 and then we we have this uh we run this                                 factory as a sort of a refinery                                 uh so you can view it as the uh the                                 externalized uh or                                 outsourced data team or data department                                 and then we channel back refined data so                                 from from raw events we channel back                                 like recommendation indexes or a fraud                                 detection service or                                 reports or anything from mundane simple                                 things like reports to to machine                                 learning so it's it's a bit of a hybrid                                 between a consultant because we do                                 customize things and a a product company                                 because we have our platform and we run                                 everything                                 internally on that platform but we don't                                 actually sell it                                 and so making this more generalized for                                 the audience                                 is so that they can see themselves in                                 this                                 the kinds of challenges that people                                 might have with data                                 that they would either have to saw                                 themselves or they might go to                                 to you and your company for those                                 services                                 what would be the the motivations what                                 would be the moment that that                                 a company says we need to do this                                 whether they do it with you or you know                                 figure out a way to do it themselves                                 yes uh so the uh                                 one of the challenges for us is to find                                 some humble companies                                 because this is so popular nowadays                                 right                                 and and people think how hard can it be                                 and then they apply a couple of data                                 scientists or or                                 a couple years ago we used to have this                                 giant hadoop or data lake project                                 and they became reasonable failures now                                 people have ai projects instead                                 and uh so um lots of companies tend                                 tend to think that this is not so hard                                 uh                                 and and we can easily build some some                                 technology and do it but it turns out                                 like for example                                 lean transformations it's not very                                 easy to do and most people fail so                                 quite often the companies that come to                                 us are the ones                                 that know that they cannot compete                                 for data engineers data scientists and                                 so forth                                 on the market so what uh our first                                 customer was it was a big retail chain                                 their i.t department was like                                           or something and they                                 didn't really have a they had an analyst                                 or two                                 so they had nothing to compete with                                 against the banks and insurance                                 companies and so forth they were                                 screening for the same talent so then we                                 were a suitable solution                                 and now we have um                                 we have care one client in                                 in the elderly care business also uh                                 quite humble with their capability and                                 and i just spoke uh earlier today with a                                 with a mining company                                 also not data as their their core                                 business so so                                 it's it's that's typically a divider                                 if you're a bank or a telco your data is                                 your core business and then they tend to                                 have the ambition to                                 to do it themselves uh and but                                 that also means that they realize that                                 maybe they don't know the way                                 forward uh right so they often come                                 uh with an idea that we have data and it                                 has potential                                 but first they need help in                                 uh you know workshopping their way                                 forward to the most                                 useful ideas and so forth and                                 uh that's when you know we contribute                                 with it with the                                 the way of working is important because                                 i've seen so many data projects fail                                 because                                 they are driven by you know poor the                                 data in the data lake and then we hope                                 so that some magic happens and so forth                                 uh but what i've learned in working with                                 the successful data companies is that                                 uh success comes from being driven by                                 use case and being driven by business                                 while                                 now you're working your way backwards so                                 the                                 uh so it's usu it's often as much                                 that they need help with with these ways                                 of working and how to                                 fix how to think about business value                                 and data as it is                                 uh with the technology and the actual                                 execution                                 so given what you just described and                                 i've uh by the way                                 audience i've just tried sticking a                                 question in the                                 in the chat or the the question window                                 myself                                 to see if i know how to do this and make                                 sure i see your questions                                 um so i've made a note to self here                                 let's ask lars                                 the issues that you're describing and by                                 the way i love your                                 comment about your in search of the the                                 humble company the humble person                                 uh but they they may be they may be                                 humble or they                                 may need to be humble regardless of the                                 size of the company or the particular                                 sector                                 i would think the kind of issues that                                 you're talking about                                 really come across for anyone who's                                 trying to extract                                 value from data and either haven't built                                 their own team yet                                 aren't prepared to build their own team                                 you know have tried it but haven't been                                 really as successful as they wanted or                                 have a huge team but know that they                                 there are approaches that can make them                                 much more efficient                                 and so am i right thinking it's not a                                 particular size                                 company it's a a situation that can                                 pull closer it's a situation yes uh                                 i i i also had conversation with very                                 large companies                                 where they where product managers                                 are uh aware that they could do more                                 right then they want to build                                 data-driven products maybe they come                                 from a more data mature company earlier                                 but they and they have a you know a lake                                 in the entertainment and                                 might not be delivering what they need                                 uh so                                 and and that makes them reach out                                 externally for help just as they might                                 take in                                 a a niche consultant they might partner                                 with us                                 for the medium companies partnering with                                 us is a                                 sort of a strategic uh decision right we                                 become the team that builds the data                                 platform                                 and the daily link and so forth and uh                                 although we do occasionally do smaller                                 you know                                 one-off little things as i say                                 as an early start it you need some kind                                 of size                                 to motivate building up a a                                 lake and a platform yeah and so i would                                 think                                 even for people who do eventually they                                 either want to use a service like this                                 so that they don't have to build                                 themselves or if they are planning to                                 build it                                 it certainly could work better uh to                                 first get some success                                 under the belt you know i i think                                 there's a a great lesson to watch how                                 something is done well                                 uh even if you plan to do it you know                                 yourself later so you can                                 understand what works and what doesn't                                 and it also you know has you                                 uh has you in in motion uh                                 uh kind of absolutely and it's the                                 fastest way to learn right i                                 i have been with so many developers that                                 come into                                 the to the big data world and and they                                 have a background                                 from software engineering or from                                 analytics or or data science or                                 something                                 and then uh the you know the first three                                 months                                 they are confused uh not by necessarily                                 by the complex technology but the new                                 ways of working                                 uh and and then after six months they                                 they are                                 they sort of grasp the concepts and they                                 are ready to teach the next person                                 coming in and there's no if more                                 efficient way to learn that than to work                                 with people who've done it a long time                                 in production                                 in sharp real reality                                 and something that i have very front                                 very front of mine because i've been                                 working with this a lot working with the                                 the people who                                 are using our hp data fabric ezreal data                                 fabric                                 also ted dunning and i just finished                                 another of these short books                                 called ai and analytics at scale and one                                 of the issues that we bring up                                 and i i think this underlies what you're                                 saying                                 is that some people aren't necessarily                                 looking for a solution because they                                 don't even think a better way to do                                 something is possible                                 or a different way to put it is just                                 because they've                                 put something together and it's working                                 today doesn't mean it's working well                                 and more importantly it doesn't mean it                                 will                                 scale and scale with not just larger                                 amounts of data but different                                 applications                                 uh have the flexibility to do new things                                 without                                 interruption or without having to                                 re-architect and then that leads                                 uh companies especially i t to just say                                 no                                 every time a new idea comes so sometimes                                 it kind of looks like things are working                                 but it's really missed opportunities                                 i think you're talking about either                                 using                                 services like your company or building                                 services like that into                                 a company so that that greater                                 efficiency and                                 and being scale efficient and making use                                 of things like data ops                                 um can actually make it possible not                                 only do what you're doing                                 today better but say yes to to new                                 things does that does that fit with your                                 experience                                 absolutely um and when you look at it                                 it's usually                                 the uh it's usually conway's law it's                                 sort of the                                 organization of the of the company                                 that's                                 reflecting in the products and                                 reflecting in the flow of data so                                 i um i wrote the blog post i think it                                 was two years ago i was going to shop                                 something at ikea                                 i'm in sweden i shop furniture at ikea                                 uh and uh and i went through the website                                 you know and search for the thing                                 results if they had just ranked by                                 popularity i would have been much faster                                 and                                 i when i clicked on the thing there was                                 no cross links to the                                 to the relevant information so forth and                                 you could see                                 in this experience right with in every                                 single step                                 they sort of failed to match my                                 expectations of them showing the right                                 data not because they were not                                 able to or because it wasn't there but                                 because i could see                                 a a a boundary between teams inside the                                 organization right here was a search                                 team and here was                                 the catalog team and how was the                                 checkout team and so forth                                 uh and you could see that there's so                                 much potential                                 in in cutting down the friction to to                                 more revenue                                 if you just focus on not acting so                                 no artificial intelligence i call the                                 blog post uh that i wrote i wore the                                 official                                 stupidity because that was what it's all                                 about you already have the information                                 about my address just put it in the                                 field right i don't know i don't want to                                 type it                                 and and then six months passed                                 and then i checked it went there again                                 and they had redesigned the whole thing                                 and made this really smooth                                 transition and that was user customer                                 oriented and i was like yes                                 you grasped it now i love this                                 comment that you just made i haven't                                 heard anybody say it that way but it's                                 just beautiful the sense that                                 you have that in this case the first                                 experience a frustrating                                 uh user experience but you can see                                 in there you can see those barriers                                 between teams                                 uh because you have the experience to                                 know the difference of                                 it's kind of working or it's working                                 well so let's take that moment and sort                                 of pivot here and                                 and let's jump in more deeply into                                 uh talking about what what data ops                                 actually is and what i mean by it may be                                 a little different than what you mean by                                 it and it hasn't become a kind of a                                 buzzy term                                 so i'm just going to throw this out for                                 the audience you'll hear data ops                                 devops mlaps i loved a term that lars                                 did in a comment back to me the                                 the everything ops all the other ops                                 and i just have two two suggestions as                                 we                                 have lars jump more deeply into this uh                                 but for the audience                                 don't be overly distracted by the exact                                 definition                                 let's take data outs exact different                                 what i mean by it what he means by maybe                                 slightly different                                 don't get lost in fine point you know                                 we're not a third grade teacher here                                 we don't have to have kids right out of                                 definition uh                                 so don't get lost in the definition but                                 the same time because these words have                                 gotten kind of latched on to my                                 marketing departments and so forth and                                 they're very buzzy                                 excuse me buzz words                                 it also don't discount them                                 because there is enormous value in these                                 approaches                                 the kind of overlapping approaches of                                 data ops                                 in particular and all the the different                                 ops the ideas behind them and                                 executed well can make a tremendous                                 difference in organizations and how they                                 work in the productivity                                 in the user experience as large as just                                 described as you begin to see a                                 transition in how things work                                 so uh with that in mind                                 launch us into what is data ops                                 uh what kind of problems do they solve                                 now you gotta be curious can i hear your                                 definition                                 well mine is much more simplistic and                                 remember i'm the one that communicates                                 with people about these things you're                                 the one who actually goes in there in                                 the real world                                 rolls up your sleeves put your hands in                                 and helps people build the systems                                 uh and also i have a very data centric                                 point of view because i've worked four                                 years                                 with the the data fabric technology and                                 people who are trying to bring data                                 together on that                                 so with that in mind data ops to me                                 is an approach that is i look at kind of                                 the human cultural side of it                                 and the specifically with regard to data                                 but very much what you said of that                                 breaking down these walls between teams                                 and i have a little figure i've used in                                 a couple of books and things i've                                 written so you have to imagine i'm                                 drawing it here in the air                                 you have the different departments uh                                 within a company                                 and things tend to get compartmentalized                                 you know are you the the database person                                 are you the machine learning person or                                 you know or you and i t                                 whatever um but with the data ops                                 approach you kind of think of a team                                 cross cutting with cross functional                                 skills                                 and not just touchy feely words but                                 literally the person sitting in the seat                                 who who engineers the data collects the                                 data who                                 uh processes it who finds it who stores                                 it who handles it for                                 data versioning if you're doing machine                                 learning the person who's actually                                 building the model hopefully the people                                 who are talking to                                 the domain experts so all this is done                                 set into appropriate context                                 the people who are going to deploy                                 things or it doesn't have to be machine                                 learning and data ops anybody's                                 working analytics whatever they're doing                                 with data extracting value                                 who's who's determining how people share                                 data all of that                                 everybody's got a role and they can be                                 expert in the thing that they do                                 but if you build that cross-functional                                 team they're focused on a shared goal                                 and at the human level it can mean                                 things as simple as                                 i have my role to play you have your                                 role to play but if you ask me to do                                 something it's not like you're asking a                                 favor of me to process or get this data                                 for you                                 is we're all you know rowing in the same                                 boat and going the same direction                                 and i think that changes how people feel                                 about certainly changes the                                 communication lines                                 that go across the team toward the goal                                 as opposed to constantly up to                                 you know some other manager and that can                                 really slow things down so that's a                                 i think a very small aspect of it but                                 that's kind of my                                 slice through it yeah we are in                                 essentially in complete agreement i i i                                 think                                 the the uh important aspect of data ops                                 is the human side                                 i'd like to take a like a historical                                 perspective on it and that goes back to                                 the                                                               roy and roy the the water                                 fault paper uh back i think it was                                      um and uh                                 he wrote this paper and which was an                                 observation of how people were were                                 working at the time and it's                                 he said it seems to follow this uh this                                 like linear engineering process that we                                 all know                                 with you know design uh requirements and                                 design and coding and                                 uh quality assurance and deployment and                                 so forth                                 and then and at the end of the paper he                                 he like                                 he said this is probably not a good idea                                 and i have some suggestions here for                                 improvements and this                                 started scratching on agile but people                                 read this paper and says yes that's what                                 we do                                 we we now have a method let's call it                                 waterfall                                 and there we were and                                 that was a completely compartment                                 compartmentalized right you threw things                                 over the wall to the next stage                                 all of the time and eventually somebody                                 figured out that hey maybe we shouldn't                                 throw things over the wall to the qa                                 people let's work together with them                                 right and that was called extreme                                 programming because it was such an                                 extreme idea                                 and then people realized maybe we should                                 like uh                                 you know have the design and coding be                                 intermingled and iterative and figure                                 out what people want and and that was                                 called agile                                 it's not another set of people that are                                 working together and then eventually                                 when we reached operations it was called                                 devops                                 because we were the developers were                                 working with operations                                 and now uh when when sort of big data                                 entered the                                 this scene uh we started working                                 uh we started throwing things out and                                 then measuring and bringing back the                                 measurements to affect the design right                                 and so big data is not about technology                                 it's about a new way of                                 working together towards multiple                                 disciplines towards the same goal                                 and then when that that reached out to                                 operations as well we got data ops and                                 then we                                 threw in the data scientists and then we                                 got envelopes so                                 all of these like shifting left                                 uh things are all all about getting                                 people                                 with different skill sets and different                                 mindsets to work together towards the                                 same goal and explicitly be very                                 explicit about this                                 same goal uh it used to be like                                 development and qa had completely                                 different goals right                                 one was to produce bikes the other was                                 it was to squash or find the bags and                                 the operations also                                 they didn't want any deployments because                                 they would risk their stability and                                 their bonuses                                 and and so forth uh and late very late                                 to the game we have security who who's                                 been uh                                 detached forever like but now we're                                 seeing some dev set props and                                 and things are are shifting left there                                 as well so                                 it's really on the human side and then                                 uh if you if you start                                 there and work towards the same goal                                 then there are things                                 that you need to do that you perhaps                                 didn't think about                                 doing before like measuring quality of                                 things measuring data quality for the                                 benefits of                                 of of the people doing quality assurance                                 or or the people who care about the                                 the machine learning models working in                                 production and so forth so it affects                                 the                                 activities and processes and tooling but                                 it's really this                                 this align goal that that sort of the                                 the gist of                                 of their knobs and i think                                 i really like the way you put that this                                 early starting with the the waterfall                                 stage this idea of throwing things over                                 the wall                                 uh and and you're really saying stop you                                 know pull pull down the wall and                                 hand things because it's not a throw it                                 over the wall and you know hope a                                 miracle happens                                 and there's no no feedback about you                                 know the these things are or                                 should be fluid i think from what you're                                 supposed to be it has been like that for                                 when data science first came in right                                 they were writing their models in python                                 throwing them over the wall got                                 translated to java throwing all the                                 walter operations and so forth and                                 that creates very slow cycles so so                                 a data ops and amalaps is really                                 a key success factor to to succeeding                                 with data or succeeding with machine                                 learning it's absolutely necessary to                                 have                                 in order to have sustained success with                                 data machine learning                                 so uh you saw me just move a piece of                                 paper here i had a little note                                 uh to remind myself in some of our                                 conversations                                 uh and i want to make sure we have time                                 to hit all of this but                                 uh you've reminded people that in uh                                 google had defined in mlaps kind of                                 three levels of maturity                                 uh zero if you're doing it with a a                                 stick and a                                 and a and a rock no i'm sorry that's                                 level one is you're beginning to build                                 an ml pipeline level two                                 uh cid cd you're doing continuous                                 integration continuous deployment                                 for pipeline automation and i think that                                 that style it's not exactly that same                                 thing but that level two                                 uh kind of approach or mindset uh                                 sounds a lot like with things that i've                                 heard you say or seen                                 seen you write about the kinds of                                 services that you're bringing to people                                 but to do this within                                 the the data ops world uh to get into                                 that style do                                 am i understanding that correctly uh yes                                 um absolutely we i                                 have realized that we come from a when i                                 say                                 we here the our company and and you know                                 the                                 the general uh sphere of                                 people in stockholm the that uh i've                                 worked with so far we come from a                                 fairly different                                 direction with a different angle on                                 working with data and data engineering                                 than most of the people that i meet                                 because when uh                                 we adopted hadoop very early and hadoop                                 was really primitive at the time it                                 could only do a few things like                                 mapreduce and store lots of data                                 and and a no and so forth                                 and that really forced us into                                 regarding these data problems as                                 software engineering problems right                                 and towards a very high degree of                                 automation                                 and it enforced the                                 functional parenting but on their                                 architecture level the                                 data sets are immutable because there is                                 no way to to                                 edit them anyway so you have to do                                 express things in functional                                 transformations that                                 which is the only thing you can do with                                 mapreduce right                                 and um that was                                 lucky because we were these are some of                                 the key points in                                 in successful data is to adopt these                                 these                                 principles of functional paradigms of                                 um immutability functional                                 transformations workflow orchestration                                 to keep the whole thing                                 together and uh retrying everything                                 would pull                                 so that it's naturally stable and so                                 forth and we got a few things right by                                 uh creating luigi the first uh first                                 sort of modern                                 workflow orchestration which has                                 made which was the key thing that made                                 us a scale                                 to to thousands of pipelines                                 and uh nowadays there are so many things                                 right that you can choose from and uh                                 they are not pushing you                                 as an adopter today they are not pushing                                 you towards the                                 the seeing the whole problem of software                                 engineering and                                 and uh towards high degrees of                                 automation                                 because there is no money there the                                 vendors all go to meet you                                 where you are right                                 what's your process uh okay you are you                                 you're used to sql                                 databases and mutable tables and so                                 forth okay we'll we'll tack this thing                                 on to hadoop or to the cloud so that you                                 can keep your workflows but you can                                 still buy                                 our thing and thereby they're eroding                                 the whole value because the whole value                                 wasn't changing your workflows                                 yeah yeah um so now i went on a                                 little round here but this is some of                                 the the sort of misconceptions that that                                 i see                                 and this is i i believe uh                                 this we came from from a highly                                 automated                                 environment and this makes us view data                                 working with data very differently from                                 the                                 from their doctors today so                                 by the way i liked your rant so                                 i've a few notes here of some questions                                 i want to ask and i just start                                 reshuffling the cards                                 because i want to take take us where you                                 took us just now                                 with this little this little rant and                                 two two ideas so                                 um i think a key idea for people to take                                 away from this                                 is the sense of yes the shared goal yes                                 the cross-functional team                                 but also what you just touched on this                                 sense of                                 uh why it matters to automate some of                                 these processes                                 and to and and how to automate them and                                 how to automate them well                                 the immutable input immutable output why                                 those kinds of approaches                                 are good and at first glance it can                                 sound like that                                 then gives people less flexibility but                                 it actually gives them more flexibility                                 i think because if you                                 build the basic logistics more                                 effectively                                 then it's easier to to make changes to                                 add new things in because not                                 everything is having to be done one step                                 at a time is that                                 is that it's basically about pushing the                                 cost down of your operations and your                                 toil                                 and of the the cost of running new                                 experiments because you need to run                                 experiments and                                 sometimes succeed sometimes failing or                                 in order to to get forward that                                 that's uh one of the things that that uh                                 jeff bezos uh brings out when it when                                 asked about amazon success we were able                                 to do a thousand experiments                                 in instead of a hundred experiments and                                 that made makes a lot of difference                                 um so one way to look at it here is is                                 uh                                 what i the three phases that i call                                 of any human activity that i call like                                 muscle powered and mechanized and                                 industrialized                                 uh so if you look like forestry you can                                 have a handsaw                                 or an axe to cut your tree down and then                                 you get a chainsaw                                 and it's you still you you as a human                                 but you know you have a power tool and                                 then the next step is is forestry                                 machines where there's                                 quite not so much human involvement but                                 the machine sort of does                                 all of the work uh and in every activity                                 that you can find like transportation                                 food                                 there's a equivalent three phases of                                 evolution and uh the the                                 corresponding for data is spreadsheet is                                 the muscle powered thing right                                 that the human essentially does all of                                 the things and the data warehouse era is                                 the                                 is the epitome of                                 uh or the crest of all the uh power                                 tools era where it's                                 where it's everything is controlled by                                 humans                                 uh and with little automation                                 uh but it's it's sort of steered by the                                 analyst usually for                                 for bi purposes so what what uh                                 and google uh in the early to notice                                 took us into the into this                                 industrialized era                                 where uh where humans no longer work                                 with the actual data                                 they work with a process that that                                 transforms the data                                 just like the you know in the toyota                                  factory there's                                  there's very little humans that actually                                  touch the car primarily it's it's                                  machines that                                  touch the car with some exceptions of                                  course right                                  and but the majority of companies                                  are remain in this mechanized                                  stage and only the big tech companies                                  like we in scandinavia                                  one of like four or five companies                                  perhaps that are                                  mature in this industrialized stage i                                  know there's a lot more                                  silicon valley is is a number of years                                  ahead of us                                  here um but the majority of companies                                  are are in the uh in the power tools                                  stage                                  and that's where the the the revenue                                  and and the money is so that's what what                                  the                                  what the vendors sort of go for but                                  the or the cost of running things                                  is is several orders of magnitude                                  between the muscle powered and the uh                                  and the mechanized and between the                                  mechanized and the                                  uh and the industrialized and people                                  don't realize how big these differences                                  are but if                                  you i've talked to lots of like bank                                  telcos and so forth                                  here in sweden and and when i asked them                                  so so your analytics department or                                  your data warehouse like how how many                                  data sets                                  does it produce each day and they they                                  might have you know                                                    with                                  with bi or analytics and they say well                                  we produce like                                      uh different reports or things for                                  dashboards or whatever each day                                  right and then go to spotify and and                                  they are producing                                  a few hundred thousand data sets per day                                  right so so it's it's like three orders                                  of magnitude                                  uh and then you go to google and then                                  they're not they're rarely official with                                  these                                  things but five years ago they said they                                  were producing                                                        per day right so so people think that oh                                  well maybe                                     times more with like thousands of times                                  more right and                                  then the cost goes down for right                                  obviously they don't have like tens of                                  thousands or more people but the cost                                  of running a thing goes down and you                                  spread the the knowledge and the ability                                  in the organization                                  and then people can do new things right                                  so                                  so if the cost is very high you can only                                  do the most valuable things like like                                  counting your revenue or or your uh                                  marketing                                  steering your marketing decisions and so                                  forth uh but then it goes down and then                                  you can do things like a b                                  testing and uh and the product uh                                  insights and so forth and if it goes                                  further down you get to the machine                                  learning that that's usually the                                  part with the lowest return of                                  investment so you really have to push                                  things further down in order for that to                                  be                                  like available to you to get to get                                  sustainable ride for machine learning i                                  love to hear you say this i i                                  wrote i don't know a year ago six months                                  ago an article for cio.com called can                                  you afford innovation                                  exactly and and also with the the things                                  that you know i've                                  written or said with uh with uh ted                                  dunning who's the                                  cto for data fabric here at hpe uh                                  so many times uh looking at this                                  question                                  exactly what you just said of when by                                  the time you are looking at machine                                  learning and ai                                  these are um                                  exploratory approaches they're                                  speculative and the potential payoff                                  for those approaches that happen to hit                                  right and work                                  are enormous and um enormous not just in                                  terms of                                  money revenue changes you can do                                  different things move at a different                                  speed but also                                  enormous in terms of literal literal                                  payback                                  but it's not you start a project and you                                  just guarantee on this date                                  you know it's it's paying back they are                                  uh speculative and so if you lower that                                  uh entry cost because for example you're                                  sharing data or because your overall                                  operation costs are less or you have                                  that ability                                  uh to innovate uh it costs the                                  the the cost of trying it is so much                                  less you can try more things and the                                  likelihood of                                  hitting the one that's going to pay off                                  goes up i think that's a real key to                                  people who say                                  you know does ai bring real value or or                                  does it not well it very much depends on                                  those kinds of approaches and if you                                  have built in a way to take action                                  you know again these things are not                                  magic and so i think your                                  your kind of operations extend not just                                  to the                                  the goes-ins but what happens to the                                  goes-outs how do you                                  how do you deliver insights from data                                  but then is that                                  tied again those those walls between                                  teams is it tied to                                  either a human action or an automated a                                  machine action but something that                                  actually                                  you know it carries that into uh into                                  the real world so i'm just                                  thrilled to hear you say that well we're                                  nearing the end of our time so i want to                                  jump in and just ask you                                  completely for well first of all this is                                  if there's something you want to tell us                                  or a question you want to                                  ask ask your own question but here's my                                  question for you                                  you know so i'll i'll give you a plug i                                  think the                                  one of the best advice people can do if                                  they want to try these approaches is                                  contact you                                  and talk about it but say they're doing                                  it for themselves                                  what advice do you give                                  and let's say if you're the uh the                                  developer                                  the the the engineer the data engineer                                  hearing this                                  um or any other persona you want to                                  advise                                  but what is the practical advice uh                                  first of all to be able to tell                                  whether is is your organization already                                  doing this                                  or are they kind of look like they're                                  doing it but you know what are the hints                                  that it's not                                  they're not they haven't really tapped                                  in and then if                                  if they do feel like they want to make                                  these changes how do they                                  you know what steps what are the                                  practical start today steps for people                                  to take                                  yeah so uh the question are you are you                                  doing it                                  you can you can find an answer to that                                  by by measuring agility right the                                  uh i'm sure you and some of the                                  listeners are                                  aware of the dora report the devops                                  reports and                                  the accelerate book which i recommend                                  everyone to read                                  um they they measure agility in terms of                                  operations and devops right and one of                                  the                                  and and they measured reliability and a                                  whole bunch of other things but one of                                  the measurements of                                  agility is how long does it take you to                                  get an id out into production right or                                  line of code out into production                                  and the uh the elite uh minutes                                  and uh the the training trailers                                  you know six months which is what it                                  used to be like                                  uh and uh you can measure similarly in                                  data agility like if i have an idea of                                  how to use                                  these three pieces of data that are                                  spread uh throughout the company for                                  for uh protection or whatever how long                                  does it take me to get that                                  idea out into production well that's                                  that's at least                                  six months in most companies uh and                                  uh what is blocking you right is for is                                  uh are questions that you can ask                                  in order to to figure out how to bring                                  that agility down or if you have data                                  flows                                  uh and as sort of have                                  gotten to some kind of level of maturity                                  what does it take to                                  uh change these data flows uh so i threw                                  out a                                  poll on twitter today right if you were                                  to change the meaning of one field how                                  does                                  from uh early up upstream in your data                                  pipelines how long does it take until                                  that                                  change has propagated a very trivial                                  change                                  and the majority of answers was it was                                  more than six months                                  and that's nothing to be ashamed of we                                  had these fields at spotify that we can                                  get rid of for years                                  uh but that is those things are                                  are slowing you down right and and those                                  they uh slow down innovation they the                                  things you can't get rid of accumulate                                  technique and so on but                                  the ability to innovate is more                                  important than the                                  ability to clean up your debt so how                                  so if you are in an organization and you                                  say this sounds good to me                                  and yeah i want to you know i want to                                  take that step what are some                                  yeah that was a great description of how                                  can you tell                                  are you already there uh and some of                                  this you know people may say it sounds                                  good but they're not the ones                                  you know pulling the strings to say now                                  we're going to go in this                                  in this new direction so how can people                                  begin to                                  um get either either take initial steps                                  themselves or                                  are trying other people's organization                                  to                                  to say yeah they're really there's a                                  valuable other approach or what you said                                  earlier                                  that that uh motivate people toward this                                  desire for                                  for automation for a data ops type                                  approach and                                  this is where when we get to you don't                                  need me to build technology you need an                                  organizational coach                                  and so so uh what i would                                  say these days if you ask me if five                                  years ago i would decide well                                  you know build these things on in the                                  cloud build the spot cluster or whatever                                  that that                                  doesn't matter at all uh what you need                                  to do                                  is to figure out what what would the end                                  goal look like right                                  what what what would a piece of success                                  look like                                  and then and then you go backwards from                                  there and say we have these data sources                                  and and                                  what does it take to bring them and bri                                  and get our computation                                  in production to to fulfill the end goal                                  and then you bring in tools such as like                                  value stream mapping                                  uh which is a way to figure out where                                  you spend your time when when you're                                  developing a                                  product right and and in most value                                  stream maps you you                                  the the result is that you realize that                                  you spend one percent of your time                                  doing the real work the coding or the                                  testing or whatever and then you spend                                                                              of your time waiting for people waiting                                  for an approval                                  waiting for for somebody else to put in                                  the backlog in your private and so forth                                  and if you get to                                     then your your elite awesome right so                                  most organizations                                  don't go beyond the same single digits                                  and then you have to                                  find someone who can actually change                                  real things like change the shape of                                  your teams in the shape of your                                  organization                                  so it's really a the challenges are                                  our leadership and organization all the                                  way work more than anything else                                  i have the impression i wonder if this                                  fits your experience                                  that one problem is that                                  people trying to think of a                                  a polite way to say this                                  oh go ahead with you know                                  we're not so polite here in scandinavia                                  american way i'll just blurp it out                                  there                                  is that sometimes and maybe i don't know                                  if it's the individual engineer or the                                  team lead or the                                  people higher up in the organization but                                  they                                  hear about a new approach and they want                                  they were                                  they don't want to miss an opportunity                                  they don't want to miss you know they                                  don't want to be behind the curve                                  they're trying to be competitive                                  um but they sometimes approach this i                                  mean even subconsciously                                  by they want to keep their old                                  assumptions                                  so they're they don't because not that                                  they're defending them they it's not                                  even a question                                  i mean they haven't realized that that's                                  that's framing what they do and they say                                  give me that new technology i'll buy                                  that new technology                                  and you know i work for a company that's                                  selling                                  software technology so you know yay but                                  yeah i'm sorry i i know i'm                                  contradicting your                                  your agenda here but i would say don't                                  buy any new technology                                  because that's the thing that makes a                                  difference                                  well i do think the people who you                                  even who who buy our wonderful                                  technology                                  we really see a difference in people and                                  with this part of                                  the the book that ted and i just did                                  it's got like our                                                     talking about people who um                                  don't just get this technologies because                                  you do need some fundamental                                  tools that give you the opportunity to                                  democratize                                  data and share and i mean then that's                                  fundamentally what this                                  this data fabric does but that people                                  who                                  the innovation needs to be not just the                                  people who build the innovative                                  technology                                  innovation to work has to be do the                                  people who                                  use it do the users have vision and so                                  do they see the possibilities do they                                  change that style do they step back and                                  say                                  you know i've been accepting trade-offs                                  that i'd you know i'm limited by my                                  technology but i'm also limited by my                                  worldview i'm not trying to build a                                  uh what i call a comprehensive data                                  strategy i think you've talked about a a                                  a a data ops manifesto you know                                  that people have to say                                  i'm going to use this in a new way it's                                  not just                                  buy the tool and plug it in i mean they                                  buy the tool plug it in they may get a                                  little advantage but they're missing a                                  huge opportunity                                  if they haven't you know plugged                                  themselves in                                  and and basically said this                                  there's a different way to do things i'm                                  sorry now i ranted on my that was my                                  soapbox about it                                  it makes sense the this is very                                  subconscious uh                                  uh i find it's it's it's very rarely                                  conscious decisions by the way i should                                  give credit for the                                  date ops manifesto is is written by the                                  a company called data kitchen                                  in boston who's they provide great                                  resources on on date obviously                                  thank you everybody's interested in                                  reading more um                                  so it's it's really subconsciously uh                                  and i i'd like to correct my                                  my statement earlier that that                                  technology does matter                                  in the sense that some technology                                  affects the way that you work                                  right it changes the way that you work                                  and                                  i brought up hadoop as an earlier                                  example or something that transformed                                  the way that we work                                  but we weren't aware of it right it was                                  completely subconscious                                  and accidental so it was pure luck that                                  somebody                                  thought it would be fun to install a                                  hadoop cluster in                                                        any business                                  idea what's uh or reason whatsoever well                                  i just                                  insert or technology may be limiting the                                  way you                                  i mean you do need the technology                                  doesn't solve the problem                                  but you do need to know if it's imposing                                  limits that wouldn't let you do the                                  kinds of approaches that you're                                  you're going for and everything                                  of this happens subconsciously right uh                                  as one another enabling technology                                  changes the way you work is the cloud of                                  course because you don't have to go                                  go and ask for machines and so forth                                  anymore and that really changes the way                                  you work                                  and and in some ways it it does                                  it's in a destructive way or maybe not                                  appropriate for you like                                  for example git and github has the                                  popularization                                  has made every company or lots of                                  companies work                                  like they were an open source project                                  but the difference is that in an open                                  source project you don't have trust                                  between people                                  so so suddenly companies work as if                                  there were no trust between the                                  different                                  teams right and that's not necessarily a                                  good thing                                  no no so uh                                  we have just a few minutes left i think                                  a closing question for you                                  is are there uh particular resources                                  that you want to share                                  or point people to uh i                                  i'll make an offer on your behalf i'll

you'd like to uh                                  leave people with today so there are a                                  couple of pointers first of all uh                                  our marketing strategy is very simple we                                  give                                  away the knowledge and information for                                  free and hope that

                      i know that reading list is is fairly                                  popular and appreciated                                  um there are a couple of uh

                like to highlight i already mentioned                                  data kitchen who                                  is providing great resources uh                                  there is a book by harwinger atwal i                                  hope i got his name                                  right on date ops and that is the best                                  data ops                                  book out there um there is                                  also a great book by jesse anderson                                  called                                  data teams and if you're a leader and                                  are interested                                  in team formations and so forth jesse                                  anderson who runs the big data institute                                  is is the best resource on on those                                  topics                                  so i think those are the resources that                                  come off the top of my head                                  but if and if you forget them just reach                                  out to me

               for some reason it's not letting me                                  add it to chat so i just stuck it in the                                  questions i don't know if everyone can
