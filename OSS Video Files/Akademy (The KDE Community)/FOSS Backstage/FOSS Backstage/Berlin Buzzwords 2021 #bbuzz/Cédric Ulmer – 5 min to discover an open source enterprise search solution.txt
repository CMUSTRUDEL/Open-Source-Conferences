	                              uh hello so                               cedric i have now less than five minutes                               to tell you about data file and operates                               enterprise search what you can and                               cannot do with the open source edition                               so                               i'm the ceo co-founder of france labs we                               are the software maker behind                               the tafari so first because i had a                                question on linkedin what is enterprise                                search in the context of our talk here                                it's an enterprise search application                                that enables employees to find all the                                information that the company possesses                                without the need to know where the                                information is                                stored and i added to this definition                                securely and the definition comes from                                the book of martin white called                                enterprise search                                so about translabs we'll skip that one                                because we don't have time enterprise                                how does that work lucian talked about                                it a bit uh in his lighting tool so                                i gained some time so before i go into                                the canon cannot                                let me to show you how you can if                                it's easy to install that actually                                community edition so you have your                                linux console you type docker pool data                                fairies slash data fairy                                ce data free you enter well i cheated                                because i already                                downloaded it because it takes two                                minutes and we have just five                                and then you just have to execute the                                commands uh which is documented on our                                docker hub                                let me copy paste you do that um                                okay and then it goes on but it takes                                five to seven minutes so you have to                                trust me that it works                                and once it is deployed you access to                                your user interface                                on the web which is similar to this one                                obviously there is nothing                                so you log in to manage your system                                okay now you go to domain and we will                                add some data to your data very                                community edition so this is part of the                                things you can do                                so it's a simplified mode uh let's index                                our webpage                                our website uh quickly seconds are                                flying                                so this is for vanity cat let's say it's                                our website                                i don't care and we start right away                                okay and                                while this is going on let's go back to                                the presentation                                so and i wanted full screen uh wait a                                minute                                shook and i click here yeah so                                uh what you can do so you can you can                                crawl multiple sources and multiple                                formats because this is enterprise                                search many systems to create so                                this is do it feasible thanks to apache                                manifold cf this is                                led by cal wright where you can do your                                indexing pipeline manage your time                                windows the bandwidth of coding et                                cetera                                and also thanks to apache tikka led by                                tim alison and this is about indexing as                                many formats                                as you can dream of and manage out of                                memories for                                strange figures for instance then it's                                about searching um                                mostly with bm                                                   default search algorithm provided by                                apache solar which we embed                                we provide the front end which is                                adjacent slabs and soon data for ui in                                beta version                                we provide internationalization you can                                analyze because we embed also open                                distro and soon open search we also                                provide lots of logs that you can                                dig into and also it's about management                                so we provide user interface to manage                                graphically your data ferry but you also                                have the manifold cf admin ui and the                                solar                                min ui what does it not allow you to do                                because it's important to know what you                                cannot do and again this is about not                                 easily managing because                                 we don't prevent you to do all the                                 things i'm going to mention it's just                                 that                                 we provide it as the enterprise edition                                 that has a license cost because yeah we                                 need to convince you to pay for                                 something                                 so that we can survive and so what i'm                                 going to list here is not forbidden it's                                 just that you need to do build it by                                 yourself so security                                 you have to build yourself the system to                                 manage the acl access control list                                 retrieval at indexing time                                 and how to connect to active directory                                 ldap for authorization authentication                                 sso et cetera                                 when about managing big data so we                                 provide                                 the enterprise edition install scripts                                 to manage your clusters solar cloud                                 also to externalize components not such                                 many fold cf this you have to do by                                 yourself                                 restarting graphically data free                                 backuping data ferry this kind of                                 systems also                                 you have to do by yourself so much                                 mostly the production part many more but                                 i don't have time but again we don't                                 prevent you to do it                                 we don't compile some components that we                                 hide how it works everything is very                                 transparent                                 so now if i go back to the demonstration                                 uh which is somewhere somewhere here                                 and i go back to the search interface                                 and it works so we have indexed things                                 and you can see typically this is you                                 have default facets you have the search                                 results you have preview mechanisms                                 you have advanced search you can save                                 your searches you have favorites etc all                                 this is provided                                 in the open source edition okay and in                                 the admin ui                                 you can do many things uh you can manage                                 uh promo links which are google like                                 google alerts you can protect your                                 single names                                 the field weights of bm                                             things are graphical and                                 here is a quick look of the next uh ui                                 so this will this is based on react and                                 you can embed it as a div                                 in in any framework you have as long as                                 you know how to use react we have                                 documented that                                 so that's it                                                             time i'm really proud of myself uh                                 i'm sure i can have some uploads so to                                 summarize to do everything start from                                 datafile.com.html                                 user container it's easier if you're on                                 windows maybe you should use the vm                                 appliance but really containers for gigs                                 my time is over but i will take a few                                 seconds more                                 lots of documentation is under                                 confidence that we provide like we have                                                                                                        and with a mirror on github                                 we have a twitter account a twitter tag                                 and with it                                 i'm done with just                                                     thank you                                 that's great thanks cedric uh yeah so i                                 was wondering if there's a flagship                                 deployment of data fari with a                                 particular use case that you could                                 briefly summarize                                 black sheep yeah i mean we we're moving                                 it's a three years project but we're                                 finalizing the                                 the move into production for the the dga                                 which is a one                                 one one one element of the french army                                 so that's pretty                                 cool but it's the enterprise edition                                 it's not a community edition                                 uh so yes sorry for the answer they kind                                 of wanted the part about security uh                                 surprisingly so yeah oh i see so you                                 can't talk about it you can't talk about                                 how great the product is for them                                 understood understood but um is there                                 perhaps another um                                 use case uh deployment that you're                                 particularly proud of that you could                                 share with us either of the enterprise                                 or the open source edition                                 it's mostly an enterprise because                                 surprisingly many of the open source                                 users don't say that they use it i don't                                 know why they are shy or something like                                 that but                                 i'm familiar with that problem sometimes                                 you've got to bribe them you know                                 t-shirts and hats seem to work for me                                 we tried the t-shirts but you know the                                 um                                 we are in production used at a free                                 enterprise edition in                                 in nuclear power plants in                                 belgium it's a company called tractabel                                 they use it                                 to assist the maintenance operators to                                 quickly find the documentation they need                                 to to work on the on the nuclear                                 equipment so this one's quite nice all                                 kinds of                                 deployments interesting                                 you
