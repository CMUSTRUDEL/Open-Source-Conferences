Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	An overview of the commercialisation of open source and a review of the potential revenue models and their interface with open source, from the first study into this in 2008 to the recent shift by Elastic away from open source to the SSPL licence. Amanda is the editor of Open Source, Law, Policy and Practise with over 20 authors, to be published in September and as the author of the chapter on commercial models and open has spent some time researching this area.

	                              what is                               open source software it's software                               where the source code is freely                               available and where it's distributed                               under an open source initiative or osi                               approved license                               that complies with the open source                               definition or osd                               and that's something that i bet very few                                people listening today could actually                                recite to me                                it's also a licensing model a                                socio-political movement and a                                development methodology                                and it's definitely absolutely the                                development methodology that's preferred                                by young developers today                                it allows innovation and it runs our                                internet our clients our databases and                                ai                                and according to titleist                                            over                                                              include open source software and over                                   of them                                is open source as someone said to me                                when i was working on open uk's state of                                open report                                phase one was published back in march                                it's like                                gravity it's all around us it's                                everywhere there's no escaping it                                marc andreessen of andreessen horowitz                                famously said that software is eating                                the world back in                                     and jim zemlin of the linux foundation                                retorted                                with uh open source's eating software's                                lunch                                people see open source in the way that                                they've experienced it                                so if you've experienced it as a couple                                of people setting up a project                                building a community building a company                                on top of that                                maybe hiring the community along the way                                maybe like a hashicorp or a mongodb                                that's how you think of it if you're an                                individual developer who scratched a                                niche created something like the linux                                kernel attracted over                                       contributors in the last                                         created uh software that's changed                                society                                that's how you view it if you've been                                part of a company's                                non-differentiating non-permanent                                collaboration through something like                                openstack the linux foundation or                                eclipse or one of their projects                                that's how you view it                                whichever model you've experienced will                                impact your view and open source                                and how it works open source today                                is part of technology and everything                                that it's trying to achieve                                back in                                                                 was my experience my first experience of                                open source                                and i joined as the head lawyer i was                                general counsel                                and i spent five years there working on                                the commercialization and business                                models around open source                                i was a point of escalation and most of                                the deals                                i want to think a little bit about that                                right now of course                                in that five years things changed and it                                changed dramatically where we moved from                                a world where software was generally                                distributed                                and worked on prem to a world where                                most software was utilized in the cloud                                or the platform economy                                now i'm going to introduce you to open                                source underdogs which is my favorite                                podcast                                and let's start by seeing canonical's                                founder mark shuttleworth                                and hearing what he has to say there's a                                real sort of double challenge                                in starting a tech operation that is                                open source                                starting a tech operation is always hard                                because you want to do something new and                                that's                                surprisingly difficult you genuinely                                have to do something different                                if you want to be successful you know                                 from a technology point of view and most                                 of the people                                 who would have that kind of open source                                 view there's there's a technology angle                                 to it right there there's something new                                 that they want to do                                 and it's hard enough getting that right                                 with open source you need to think about                                 the fact that you're enabling                                 your own competition it's the blunt                                 truth of it you're enabling people to                                 compete with you                                 with the benefit of all the things that                                 you've done and that can be both                                 financially                                 and emotionally very daunting but at the                                 end of the day                                 i don't see any other model for software                                 which is spreading as fast across all of                                 the kind of categories                                 of software out there today if you're                                 not going to be open source                                 you're almost certainly going to be                                 niche now that may be satisfying                                 for you but i doubt it                                 what mark clearly sets out there is the                                 business consequence of open sourcing                                 your code                                 and that's a combination of licensing                                 and enabling                                 your competitors with your own                                 innovation and that's the business pain                                 of using open source                                 now i've seen lawyers who've suggested                                 that you can exclude that you can stop                                 others from using your code commercially                                 in open source                                 and that's just simply not the case i                                 often think that confusion comes from                                 creative commons which is designed for                                 documentation and which does allow that                                 there is a non-commercial usage license                                 there                                 and the reason open source cannot have                                 that exclusion                                 is the open source definition and                                 definition six which requires                                 that there is no discrimination across                                 fields of endeavor                                 you may not restrict the program from                                 being used in business                                 now there's no restriction on making                                 money from open source                                 and of course you can choose to exclude                                 other people from using your social code                                 but if you do that your code is                                 proprietary and it's not                                 open source and that fact is really                                 rather binary                                 when i left canonical i worked for a                                 while advising startups                                 and they would come to me understandably                                 to talk about open source                                 and i came up with a little theory a                                 very simple theory a very simple three                                 questions                                 and that's the what-if theory what if                                 someone else takes your code and uses it                                 well most people are okay with that                                 that's kind of what they're expecting                                 with open source                                 what if they take your code and they                                 make money from it                                 less keen what if they use your code and                                 they make a lot of money from that                                 and you make nothing or very little or                                 significantly less                                 and at that point i would often not hear                                 from them again commercializing open                                 source                                 requires balance it requires the balance                                 between the the scale that can be                                 created                                 and the adoption that comes from open                                 source                                 and you know you're developing code                                 that's not niche and that has to be                                 balanced against the price of                                 non-discrimination                                 which must be allowed by all i repeat                                 that all                                 open source licenses now at this point i                                 could show you a variety of snippets of                                 founders who've clearly not understood                                 that when they've open sourced the code                                 but i don't really see any benefit in                                 calling them out in that way                                 instead let's focus on the advantages                                 and the business models                                 and i think we should go to shannon                                 williams founder of rancher co-founder                                 of rancher                                 which was sold

enabled                                 you know a startup with relatively you                                 know with no name recognition obviously                                 to come into in a lot of ways what's a                                 very crowded market                                 we made rancher fully open source and                                 free because                                 we felt that it was the best way to get                                 adoption to plant seeds and                                 organizations that would need this                                 technology                                 shannon's not alone in recognizing that                                 rapid adoption of open source                                 and i'd like now to go to james waters                                 co-founder of pivotal                                 which was sold for                                             to vmware also in                                                   enjoy working on open source projects                                 because                                 they can have a breadth of impact                                 that's pretty unimaginable to something                                 that you have to commit a sales                                 transaction and for software before                                 someone can use it                                 these are the kind of impacts that open                                 source can have                                 worldwide deep into developer                                 developer impact that you could never do                                 with a you know closed source only                                 enterprise sale only product i think                                 just the unimaginable breadth that open                                 source can get to you and the ubiquity                                 that it can get to in the modern world                                 is                                 is is stunning so that's humbling to                                 work on                                 i think the challenge then is like well                                 how do you make sure that the largest                                 you know                                                            world are contributing to that                                 and that's where i do have a passion for                                 enterprise monetization of open source                                 and finding ways of partnering with                                 those organizations and packaging and                                 pricing things                                 such that they feel that there's good                                 value in partnering with these open                                 source companies                                 and making them their most meaningful                                 platform                                 so that marketing and growth advantage                                 which is the developer's ability in                                      to go to github gitlab or any other                                 public repo                                 and to take open source code introduce                                 it to their business                                 and avoid a procurement process that's                                 an ability to scale your code your                                 your open source that proprietary just                                 cannot compete with                                 and it works really well in a                                 developer-focused business model                                 okay business models so back in                                      matt asley under the auspices of                                     created what's the                                 probably if not definitely the first                                 report on open source business models                                 and one of the key findings then was                                 that vendors must choose                                 complementary development licensing                                 and revenue strategies in order to                                 maximize revenue generation                                 opportunities                                 and he identified the bottom line and                                 the bottom line was that open                                 source is not a business model it's a                                 development and distribution model that                                 is enabled by a licensing tactic now                                 matt wrote that                                                       things                                 haven't changed much the list of revenue                                 generation models he gave isn't very                                 different today                                 and he started with support and we see                                 support as one of the least popular                                 models today because it's hard to scale                                 at the same time we see successful                                 businesses like rancher and percona                                 using that                                 another is subscription a little like                                 support often including support but with                                 other services bundled around it maybe                                 indemnity                                 maybe updates and that's red hat's model                                 which we saw lead in                                                     tech                                 transaction in history red hat sale for                                                                                    now whether that is something that's                                 replicable really remains to be seen                                 and i think you need to be close to the                                 key technology for it to work and in                                 red hat's case they're very close to the                                 linux kernel                                 we will see whether it's repeatable                                 because suse which                                 uses the same model and which describes                                 itself as the biggest independent vendor                                 of open source today                                 is going to ipo in june so watch this                                 space                                 another is open core you're probably                                 surprised to find that                                      asla identified that most companies were                                 using both proprietary and open source                                 in their businesses                                 and they were doing that he said to                                 balance a higher cost of development and                                 marketing                                 now that when aslet wrote that that was                                                                                        gate before we had a github economy and                                 this marketing advantage didn't exist at                                 that time so these costs today are much                                 more balanced and there's less need to                                 balance that                                 yet we still see open core particularly                                 for the vc-backed                                 bay area companies as a popular model                                 and we have others like                                 systems integrators and managed services                                 providers who will                                 generally provide services across a                                 multitude                                 of products whether those are all open                                 source or a mixture of open and                                 proprietary                                 and the key issue that we're seeing                                 today seems to be                                 single product companies single product                                 vendors                                 companies which work with a single                                 product are obviously putting all their                                 eggs in one basket                                 and this seems to be much more difficult                                 and much more susceptible to the                                 problems in the cloud environment                                 we see something different with                                 multi-product vendors                                 and whether or not that a single product                                 vendor will survive as a model                                 remains to be seen if you think about                                 you know how many projects you want to                                 take on like say mongodb is a fairly                                 focused company you know one core thing                                 elastic a fairly focused company                                 but you get into the platform world                                 companies like hashicorp                                 are very successful doing multiple                                 projects                                 i think pivotal is probably one of the                                 broader                                 breadth open source companies out there                                 certainly red hat has a pretty broad                                 breadth                                 you hit a point where you become the                                 platform provider of choice                                 for their next generation of design and                                 actually the pressure comes to do more                                 and more and more                                 one of the biggest pressure points for                                 us was always like okay we love this as                                 an application platform now provide us                                 the whole universe of data services on                                 the platform                                 and so you have to achieve a certain                                 critical mass to to have the scale to                                 invest like that but i do think that in                                 enterprise segmentation it's powerful                                 when you can start to have people accept                                 the offerings you do have                                 and then the biggest pressure is and now                                 add this so i can have one coherent                                 approach and i think that that's                                 something that's really important for                                 open source companies to think about it                                 like if you look at how amazon operates                                 they are not a federation of hundreds of                                 little hosting providers all coming                                 together                                 they really have that sort of single                                 point of interface to all of their                                 abstractions                                 so i think that's the interesting                                 dynamic in the world right now of open                                 source                                 is like how broad you should go in your                                 portfolio do enterprise                                 buyers favor that is it better to be                                 lower end single product                                 interestingly both pivotal and rancher                                 like many successful open source                                 companies                                 are in the kubernetes the cloud space                                 but success doesn't just come in that                                 space                                 we've also seen success success in the                                 database space with companies like                                 bracona                                 and precon is quite famous for not                                 having vc backing or funding                                 so let's hear from founder peter                                 zeisteff                                 so if you look at where we started                                 we started with essentia consultant and                                 especially consultant focused on                                 the high performance applications for                                 mysql and                                 and mysql alone and this gradually                                 extended                                 both in terms of the services we offer                                 so right now we have support management                                 services and                                 professional services such as consulting                                 and training                                 and in terms of technologies we cover                                 right so right now we also cover                                 mysql postgresql mongodb and                                 and marietv right so really the value                                 proposition changed from essentially hey                                 you know what we can optimize your mysql                                 performance to                                 what percona helps you to run mysql                                 postgresql                                 one could be best as it warned us in                                                                      that increased use of commercial                                 licensing                                 could create tension between the                                 expectations                                 of potential customers and commercial                                 reality now asleep could not have                                 understood                                 how or why in                                                         fruition in the way that it has                                 and in the last few years we've seen a                                 small number of apparently successful                                 companies based on open source with                                 communities                                 moving away from their open source                                 licenses to                                 proprietary alternatives and this has                                 sometimes been called a bait and switch                                 tactic and one of those companies has                                 gone so far to say that it viewed open                                 source as nothing more than a marketing                                 tool                                 and this included companies like redis                                 mongodb inelastic                                 and we've seen a move to licensing like                                 the commons clause and sspl licenses                                 so back in                                                             commons clause                                 and it was drafted by lawyer heather                                 meeker and the commons clause is an                                 add-on clause which is added to an open                                 source                                 license to exclude others from                                 commercial usage to exclude the                                 competitors                                 and as soon as you add a clause to an                                 open source license an additional clause                                 to an approved open source license                                 that license is invalidated because it's                                 no longer an improved license                                 and uh we saw redis move to it the open                                 source community greeted it with nothing                                 short of horror                                 and then in                                                              this time they moved to a new                                 proprietary license called the reddest                                 source available license                                 so let's hear from redis although                                 agpl provides a little better protection                                 than bsd because you need to contribute                                 back                                 basically any enhancement that you do to                                 the software                                 we didn't feel that this is a show                                 stopper for                                 our cloud providers to adopt a                                 successful open source projects and i'll                                 explain                                 so what happened in recent years is as                                 the cloud business grew                                 cloud providers such as aws are adopting                                 any successful open source project                                 making it                                 a fully managed service and selling it                                 for                                 tens of millions in the case of reddis                                 hundreds of millions of dollars                                 per year so what is                                 redis talking about well strip mining                                 strip mining is a very us-centric                                 term and it's an analogy from a federal                                 law created in the mid-                                      which was designed to stop abuses of the                                 land with companies strip mining coal                                 from the land                                 and this alleged strip mining came to                                 public attention in                                      in a new york times article where it was                                 reported that a number of open source                                 founders companies that were running                                 open source and distributing their code                                 open source                                 had gotten together to complain about                                 some of the hyperscalers some of the                                 cloud companies including aws who made                                 the headline                                 unsurprisingly amazon was equally                                 vociferous                                 in its response to this and while strip                                 mining call might be illegal                                 under federal law at least using code                                 which                                 the originator has freely chosen to                                 license under an open source license is                                 entirely                                 legal and that was clearly pointed out                                 by aws                                 as andy gutmann elastic actually took                                 matters                                 further by instigating litigation on a                                 trademark infringement basis against aws                                 that that seems to have disappeared                                 nobody can quite tell me what's going on                                 with that one                                 but on january                                                      founder of elastic made headlines by                                 announcing they were doubling down on                                 open                                 confusingly doubling down on open by                                 moving from an open source apache                                     license to the sspl                                 open source and business using open                                 source has                                 clearly because of all of this been in                                 the eye of a storm                                 for the last few years and some in the                                 open source community would describe                                 this as font                                 deliberately confusing and the sspl                                 is clearly not an open source license                                 but the confusion caused                                 has meant that the open source                                 initiative the osi has felt the need to                                 come out and state this publicly                                 and new terms emerged and that's faux                                 pen                                 where non-open source software tries to                                 pass itself off as open                                 when it's licensed under something like                                 the sspl                                 and mongodb commissioned heather miko to                                 draft the sspl a few years ago                                 but when they did that they took it to                                 the osi they went through the approval                                 process but before it could be rejected                                 i think they might have seen the writing                                 on the wall                                 they withdrew it from the process now an                                 interesting                                 structural fact about open source's                                 shared nature and its licensing                                 is that a community always has the                                 opportunity                                 to lift the code and move away in a fork                                 and that's exactly what's happened to                                 elastic a little bit confusing because                                 elastics moved to a proprietary                                 model it appears that elastic is the one                                 that's managing a proprietary fork and                                 the original code                                 under the open source license is now                                 being maintained by others including                                 ivan                                 it's often where it's really struggled                                 and we've seen a struggle is when                                 organizations haven't had a great                                 business plan or route to market or they                                 haven't been able to commercialize their                                 own product                                 and then all of a sudden it gets                                 embedded into something larger and then                                 the only monetization of it happens in                                 the cloud to me that's business right                                 that's something that's going to happen                                 in any space whether it's open source or                                 not and yes in our world people can take                                 and                                 build on it very easily but that's what                                 you you know you know what you're                                 getting into when you start an open                                 source software business and if you                                 don't                                 you really should research it a little                                 bit more this is the knife that cuts                                 in many ways from a business perspective                                 and i certainly would look at the world                                 and i certainly wouldn't call foul                                 if that happened to an open source                                 project                                 so how do we transition through this                                 difficult cloud-based time well                                 i would suggest that we do it with great                                 care because                                 carelessness and this world of open                                 source a lack of understanding of                                 licensing in the osd                                 could so easily break this beautiful                                 thing that we've created                                 and leave us back in a world where open                                 source may be                                 regurgitating the proprietary code and a                                 nasty mess of binary and we lose                                 what we've created now some have                                 suggested there's a third way                                 and you you'll have noticed that i've                                 explained very clearly the difference                                 between open source and proprietary code                                 and they've suggested that there's a                                 third way an alternative that could be                                 created                                 and that that third way might be public                                 or shared source                                 where source code is shared but the code                                 distribution doesn't have an open source                                 license and it doesn't meet the                                 standards of the osd potentially                                 allowing it to                                 exclude innovation being used by one's                                 competitors                                 personally that i don't think that's the                                 solution and i don't think it's the                                 solution because i don't think there's                                 the appetite for it because to create it                                 would require                                 three things and it would require energy                                 it would require funding and it would                                 require engagement                                 and having seen heather meeker try to                                 defend the                                 commons clause to a room full of open                                 source lawyers in                                      there might be one or two who'll support                                 it but i think there are very very few                                 there was no real appetite for this                                 personally i think there's a fourth way                                 now currently emotions run really high                                 there's a lot of money at stake as there                                 was i have to say                                                     first came across this problem at                                 canonical                                 and in time to come we will see                                 different problems we will see                                 further issues with different business                                 models whether it's in the internet or                                 ai                                 and we'll see more disruption coming                                 from open source and                                 incumbents never loved disruption in                                 fact if we think back                                                                                                      around operating systems and those were                                 solved by antitrust cases and                                 regulation so how do we get over this                                 strip mining how do we get over this                                 current problem                                 we look with the lens of the future and                                 the learning of the past                                 already since                                                        doing deals with                                 open source companies to share revenue                                 in                                           companies like grafana aws was also                                 public and starting to do these                                 some even allowed credits from the                                 hyperscalers to be used to buy                                 open source services and i expect that                                 this particular bump in the road                                 i expect that it will be resolved not                                 the regulation although it might be                                 but i think by negotiation                                 remember at the beginning i said open                                 source is all around                                 us it's like gravity you can't escape it                                 well today this problem isn't just open                                 sources it's societies and it applies                                 across                                 all technology across all infrastructure                                 and that means all businesses and                                 government today                                 i started by thinking about what open                                 source is and one thing                                 it is not as a business model and as i                                 come to the end of my time with you                                 today                                 let's look at mark shuttleworth again                                 reflecting on                                             canonical some things really haven't                                 changed it is about                                 enabling people to go faster with open                                 source                                 to drive down the cost of open source                                 drive down the friction                                 of open source i don't see any other                                 way of organizing software that seems                                 poised                                 to beat open source                                 bruce didn't come down from the mountain                                 with the osd                                 carved in stone you know it is no                                    commandments but the whole of society                                 today                                 relies on code that's distributed under                                 software licensing that relies on that                                 definition                                 and we must take great care of it of                                 course we must keep it under review                                 and we must also make sure that the osi                                 its guardian is well funded and well                                 managed                                 but we must also remember that open                                 source works to make the best software                                 when it comes to business we must look                                 to business models and the ever-evolving                                 ever-changing technologies that impact                                 them                                 open source will not bend to this but                                 rather these have to evolve to allow                                 open source to thrive                                 open uk is the industry body

            let me have a look at the chat i think                                 there are no questions right now in the                                 chat maybe they will come                                 they will come but let me say i                                 especially liked                                 what you said that um those um issues                                 with the um                                 new licenses now tried out by some                                 companies will be resolved by                                 yeah simply negotiations in the end                                 i think that's one right i think what                                 we've seen is um                                 it's almost like what we saw                                          ago in the operating system space                                 you know there's going to be constant                                 development evolution and change in tech                                 and we have to move with those business                                 models and adapt with those business                                 models                                 but we can't sort of go back to the                                 fundamental nature of open and reinvent                                 that every time                                 and ultimately the operating system type                                 issues were resolved by a combination                                 of i think regulatory and competition                                 authorities                                 and also um negotiations and contracts                                 and deals                                 and i think that's where we'll get to                                 but i think a lot of the tech sector and                                 the the companies involved in the cloud                                 space                                 will want to avoid if they can having                                 regulation                                 so that's why i think we will see a lot                                 more negotiation and                                 the short term and we've seen                                 since we recorded this actually we've                                 seen grafana also                                 shift and rather than shift to one of                                 these non-open source licenses one of                                 these new type of license that really is                                 proprietary                                 we've seen grafana move with the same                                 goals i've talked to them about it                                 what they've tried to achieve is staying                                 open                                 as they move to something that they hope                                 will force the hyperscalers into deals                                 with them                                 yeah very interesting um we have one um                                 question from marcus egan he asked does                                 open uk                                 pay any of the companies that produce                                 important open source libraries                                 um open uk is a not-for-profit                                 organization                                 which works to represent organizations
