Description: 
	Covid-19 put fuel to rising trends and accelerated changes that would have otherwise taken longer to take place. From remote work, artificial intelligence, and faster shifts to the cloud - businesses were forced to adapt in a tumultuous year. These are having lasting implications for the future of work.

What is this new thing being referred to as “Cloud Engineering” and why is that relevant to the future of work? Jobs requesting AI/ML skills are expected to grow 71% over the next 5 years and is considered one of the most disruptive skill areas of tech (ITCareerfinder/Burning Glass). "since the pandemic struck, investment in AI platforms has skyrocketed, shifting from a 'nice-to-have' initiative to a full-blown business imperative.“ - CIO magazine.

How is AI both good and bad for society? What are the conversations happening on the Future of Work and what will this mean?

      with you guys at this event instead of                               just doing this virtually                               i am grace francisco i am from san                               francisco                               and i'll tell you the joke about this a                               little bit later i did start off                                i care quite some time ago when i was a                                developer                                for lotus approach which is a very                                popular desktop database                                at ibm way back when and this was during                                an era where much of the web was                                actually static                                and what i did there was to actually                                take                                our windows based approach forms and                                reports and to                                make them dynamically available on the                                web not an easy feat                                back then when everything was static and                                we were just in the early days of having                                these connectors                                to things like db                                                  render dynamic data                                but those were fun days in the early                                days of the internet uh we're also                                um we would joke about the idea of ever                                buying anything off the internet                                by the way i progressed to my career i                                went through a variety of startups                                and eventually i landed at microsoft for                                my first                                job in developer relations we were                                called evangelists back then we were                                developer evangelists and i was the                                first                                developer evangelist for microsoft                                enterprise tool suite                                developer tool suite which was called a                                visual studio team system back then                                i went on from microsoft i spent a good                                eight years there learning the ropes of                                developer relations                                and went to lead developer relations at                                a variety of different organizations                                from                                small business uh arenas uh fintech                                consumer gaming uh so i've had the honor                                and privilege of working for some really                                remarkable and amazing companies                                but today i am grace francisco from                                cisco

francisco so                                a little bit of a tongue twister but at                                least it's memorable                                so for those of you who might be                                familiar with the cisco company name                                you're probably thinking this right                                network hardware                                switches routers and i can understand                                that                                that was where we our roots are from                                that's where a lot of our success was                                once upon a time but did you know if i                                can get my slide to go next                                um remote's not cooperating did you know                                that cisco is actually the fifth largest                                software                                software yes software company we are a                                software company                                and we actually are participating                                participating member of the cloud native                                computing foundation and we have hybrid                                cloud                                offerings at cisco and my role is to                                head up to devnet                                which is our developer relations program                                at cisco and we have over                                                                                                         now i love this i actually really truly                                grew up with this thing that some of you                                may have only seen                                in a museum sadly for me i have fond                                memories                                of fighting over this rotary phone with                                my sister because you only really had                                one phone                                in the house and if you had to call                                several numbers                                in a day you got a real workout with                                that finger                                of yours and then also you know if you                                were fighting with your sibling that was                                 another set of things you had to deal                                 with but today my kids they each have                                 their own phones                                 and they're not just calling people in                                 fact they rarely use it                                 to call people right because they're                                 texting they're watching videos                                 they're playing games it does so much                                 more than                                 call someone um and you know                                 there was a challenge only a few years                                 ago where father                                 challenged his son and his son's friend                                 who were i think                                                to figure out how to actually dial out                                 on this kind of phone                                 needless to say after five minutes they                                 weren't able to accomplish this                                 challenge                                 and i promise you you don't really want                                 to have to do this with the rotary form                                 it really is quite a workout with your                                 finger                                 and yet today technology is not just in                                 our phones                                 it's absolutely everywhere it's in our                                 cars it's in our doorbells it's our                                 refrigerators and in fact a friend of                                 mine                                 was giving me a demo of his toast his                                 smart                                 very smart toaster oven where you would                                 put something in                                 and it would identify the thing the                                 piece of meat or the egg wherever you                                 stuck in that oven                                 and it would figure out how to cook it                                 for you automatically                                 i know many of you are also wearing                                 smart watches to track your fitness                                 it's simply everywhere                                 and yet thank goodness for that right                                 because of last year                                 we were i felt like we were living in an                                 alternate dimension                                 didn't it um and for the beginning of                                 that pandemic i still remember i know                                 many people                                 felt this way that it felt like we were                                 like suddenly like                                 pausing and stopping in time with the                                 beginning of this pandemic everything                                 was shutting down                                 the streets were eerily quiet the                                 airport was a ghost town                                 and many of us i will admit um you know                                 resorted to binge watching                                 just to somehow have some familiarity                                 over relating to                                 what was once their society of of you                                 know                                 connecting and meeting coffee shops and                                 going out to restaurants                                 and to you know find some sense of                                 meaning in all the craziness that was                                                                                             binge watching between all the online                                 meetings many of us                                 i know have been doing all morning all                                 day all night long                                 or over walking our dogs yes i'm guilty                                 and baking all the things when we've                                 over stocked on things like                                 flour and toilet paper and top ramen                                 the world has changed really truly                                 forever                                 so while we're starting to come up and                                 out from this pandemic                                 uh it has definitely left an indelible                                 mark                                 on the world um a little over a year and                                 a half ago the pandemic                                 part of the pandemic we were thinking                                 about you know trade wars and tariffs                                 who were talking about the effects of                                 macro economic pressures                                 and geopolitical challenges and yet now                                 looking back in this year and a half of                                 a pandemic                                 it was felt kind of small compared to                                 what we've been through                                 and really truly has touched everything                                 that we do                                 in every part of the world many                                 companies weren't really                                 prepared for their rapid really rapid                                 shift                                 everyone had to move to that was imposed                                 by the pandemic                                 shutting so much down i'm sure you all                                 remember what it must have felt like or                                 when where you were at the very                                 beginning of the pandemic for me i was                                 actually at the very beginning of a                                 massive                                 move for my family just by sheer                                 coincidence                                 and that i will never forget and these                                 are memories that are forever burnt in                                 your brain                                 strangely in tech while things felt like                                 we paused for a bit                                 recruiting really did not slow in fact                                 it was                                 super competitive right in the middle of                                 pandemic to get                                 really great technical talent i suspect                                 a lot of that was the incredible demand                                 um for people who understood how to work                                 in the cloud as                                 so many businesses suddenly had to shift                                 what they were doing in person                                 to a cloud workload um and                                 you think about it that it was to help                                 ensure that we were now in a touchless                                 environment that was accessible by our                                 peers and colleagues who we needed to                                 collaborate with                                 so there are some industries that were                                 just well prepared                                 and really well oriented for this really                                 weird                                 year and a half that we've had with                                 pandemic and if i look back on it                                 telehealth telehealth i barely thought                                 about                                 right i might have used it once in a                                 year                                 at most where you you know call your                                 doctor they call you back and that                                 canada's telehealth well telehealth                                 really came a long way last year it                                 included video in many cases and that                                 was the                                 default that was the default that many                                 of us had to go to so i had many                                 telehealth appointments either for                                 myself or from my children or my husband                                 and gaming gaming thank goodness for                                 gaming thank goodness for my old company                                 that i use for                                 used to work for roblox because there                                 helped                                 there that this rope this roblox                                 community's other gaming platforms                                 helped us to have that social fabric                                 that we so                                 deeply desire to have in person it gave                                 us an                                 entertainment entertainment platform to                                 connect with our friends and family                                 uh in an entertaining way and to have                                 these shared experiences in these                                 virtual worlds                                 uh interestingly enough at the very                                 beginning of the pandemic the thing that                                 was highlighted the most was actually                                 the moocs                                 so these massive open online                                 courses that were offered were slated                                 for near death                                 at the beginning of the pandemic just                                 before it hit and yet that was                                 one of the things that skyrocketed out                                 of control and                                 you know was just scaling back up it was                                 resuscitated because of the pandemic                                 clearly because there was a deep desire                                 by many of us who wanted to reskill                                 and be able to afford the opportunity of                                 the virtual work environment that us                                 those of us who are fortunate to be in                                 tech had                                 uh at the very beginning and then of                                 course                                 we all shifted our shopping practices to                                 online                                 and digital and amazon obviously was one                                 of the                                 the biggest companies that profited from                                 this                                 uh experience and i know i had multiple                                 boxes of amazon deliveries                                 every single week if not every day as we                                 were                                 not going out and not shopping in person                                 but they were prepared and so these are                                 some of the examples of                                 industries and scenarios in which that                                 scale up happened immediately and was                                 able to                                 were able to really uh support this rise                                 and need during the pandemic                                 so now we're in this almost normal                                 year where many of us have gone                                 vaccinated and numbers are coming down                                 but the truth is things will never be                                 truly back to normal                                 as they were in pre-pandemic days the                                 future work is going to remain                                 hybrid for a variety of reasons                                 and in fact you know while we were                                 having we were having early signs of                                 hope last year at the end of last year                                 many companies were surveying their                                 employees to understand their needs and                                 desires of coming back                                 to a real office workspace and to help                                 inform them                                 of that return to real world work but                                 the reality is you know some surveys                                 have shown that                                    of workers will want to be working from                                 home                                 eight or more days each month and that                                                                    of all meetings will actually include                                 participants                                 somewhere joining from home and                                 you know it's i'm sure not a surprise                                 that                                    of really large organizations are                                 increasing that work flexibility                                 especially                                 for those who are global companies and                                 shrinking some of their office sizes                                 recognizing the deep desire for so many                                 employees to continue with that                                 flexibility to work from home                                 and you know one interesting area                                 in the middle of the pandemic was uh                                 seeing that some software teams                                 who are so used to that in-person                                 component of                                 code reviews and looking over a                                 colleague's shoulder to help out with                                 some coding and reviews                                 um it was hard to do in the middle of                                 the pandemic                                 that's the way that you operated with                                 your pull requests and your code reviews                                 and and                                 and pairing together on your insights                                 for                                 you know how to how to build things but                                 you know fortunately with all of the                                 plug-ins and integrations that are                                 available                                 the the messaging tools                                 the version control tools across the                                 board that were so                                 widely available in sas already it                                 really                                 required just a little bit of glue in                                 between to make sure that there was a                                 fabric there to                                 help create that conversation and keep                                 the effect of that conversation through                                 the code that's cited through the pull                                 request                                 that's put in and so interesting uh                                 experiences                                 cropped up that were actually pretty                                 pandemic but i'm sure had a ton of lift                                 and adoptions an open source project                                 called code stream                                 actually creates that flow between these                                 tools and streamlines it                                 so that as you're messaging someone and                                 asking for a code review                                 you can organize the code review with                                 your teammates and then                                 document seamlessly the conversation                                 that's happening                                 so that you have that preserved                                 institutional knowledge                                 as you're working through and encoding                                 and                                 building your applications so there was                                 actually a true                                 benefit and shifting all of this                                 online because that virtual                                 collaboration really captured and                                 documenting                                 documented all of these things that                                 would otherwise be just between two                                 people and you would lose                                 that transparency and the color and                                 context of those changes                                 but now it's there because it was                                 forcibly required                                 in this new virtual world that we've all                                 been operating in                                 and cloud engineering has really                                 significantly accelerated in fact it was                                 front and center                                 in the middle of uh the pandemic                                 and it had was a growing practice prior                                 to that but really                                 um having the this discipline instance                                 during the pandemic                                 was was huge in terms of really shifting                                 some of the ways that we're actually                                 organized and working together between                                 application developers and operations                                 so to support remote work um this                                 dramatic need                                 really caused businesses to scramble and                                 you know in that early part of the                                 pandemic they were looking to enable                                 their entire team                                 to do their work whether it was the ops                                 team and the infrastructure that they                                 were managing                                 or the app developers needing to work                                 together                                 and deploy their code so you know                                 of course the focus was minimizing as                                 much as that on-prem scenario                                 and the touching in the environment on                                 an on-prem situation                                 and really enabling that collaboration                                 from a really virtual perspective                                 so in                                                               of enterprises worldwide will be relying                                 on a mix of on-prem                                 dedicated private clouds and multi-cloud                                 environments                                 uh to meet those infrastructure needs                                 not well beyond                                 this pandemic                                 so we i introduced the concept of cloud                                 engineer but what do i what do i really                                 mean by this thing called                                 cloud engineering and it shouldn't mean                                 devops                                                              really                                 developers throwing things over the wall                                 to ops and ops still having to                                 to manage things from there but cloud                                 engineering truly in this new net world                                 that we've had to work in                                 in this virtual collaboration is really                                 the application of software develop                                 development                                 across all of these teams and all of                                 these motions from app development all                                 the way through                                 the infrastructure component                                 it also means that we need to                                 fundamentally                                 integrate these teams as one and that                                 we need to find the common language to                                 speak                                 across what app developers really need                                 and how infrastructure and all people                                 really need                                 to work so all of these three areas of                                 infrastructure                                 sras and aptv really need to be one                                 unified system to                                 to be optimized and working particularly                                 in this new hybrid environment will                                 continue to work in                                 so this hybrid multi-cloud app-centric                                 infrastructure                                 it was trending prior to the pandemic                                 it's                                 certainly on the rise now uh post                                 pandemic                                 and you know really you know                                 understanding that                                 you you need to be able to have some                                 consistency                                 in how you manage in mixed mode where                                 you are likely going to have                                 uh on-prem as well as cloud                                 and being able to go in between those                                 two modes in a seamless and secure and                                 performant way                                 a quick stat for you in                                         of network operations teams will be                                 required                                 to re-architect their network buying                                 stock due to                                 the impact of hybrid networking which                                 will significantly increase about                                    percent                                 uh and so there's just a huge                                 growth and trend around this multi-cloud                                 and app-centric and hybrid world that we                                 live in                                 and again going back to that this                                 concept of cloud engineering                                 you should really think about cloud                                 engineering as a practice for future                                 proofing                                 what you do today it often makes sense                                 for particularly small startups and                                 small projects to start in the cloud is                                 the most cost effective                                 way to get going because you don't have                                 to you know build anything on-prem you                                 don't have to think about the ongoing                                 cost                                 of owning hardware yourself but you know                                 as your business picks up and grows and                                 has                                 much more complex needs around                                 international presence                                 you know required to scale having                                 geo-specific needs                                 you may need to really prepare for that                                 mixed model of both cloud and on-prem                                 or perhaps you did start on-prem from                                 way back one and you need                                 the flexibility of being able to do                                 multi-cloud as well                                 having that optionality and that                                 flexibility to do that is super                                 important                                 but as developers and as cloud engineers                                 specifically in that practice                                 we need to think about that as early as                                 possible and for those who are starting                                 new projects that means from day one                                 of that project because you don't want                                 to end up wasting time in the middle of                                 peak such as the pandemic                                 having to re-architect things to fit                                 that scale and need                                 and we'll talk a little bit about some                                 scenarios around that                                 so we've seen some businesses that were                                 really set up                                 for success and the ones that use                                 informative infrastructure as code                                 to deploy the infrastructure had the                                 best setup because they could quickly                                 pivot between public private                                 cloud and on-premise deployments so what                                 is this infrastructure is code thing                                 it's really using machine readable                                 definition files for managing                                 provisioning data centers and cloud                                 deployments instead of using                                 physical hardware configuration this was                                 especially important last year                                 when teams needed to reduce high-touch                                 environment interactions                                 great open source examples of this are                                 terraform and polonie                                 so let's look at an example where                                 infrastructure as code was used                                 to help higher education the oscillation                                 between                                 on-site particularly remote and fully                                 remote education has created a                                 particularly                                 challenging scenario for colleges and                                 universities and i'd say also high                                 schools                                 and middle schools and let's say we have                                 this university that needs to go fully                                 remote learning                                 they have already used automation to                                 expand the scale as far as they could                                 with their on-prem resources now they                                 need to move some of those workloads                                 to public cloud to scale their offerings                                 virtually                                 you know the university infrastructure                                 as code solution like terraform                                 like terraform to automate the                                 deployment of their applications                                 both on-prem with intersight kubernetes                                 service                                 and in public cloud so they can easily                                 customize their automation to shift the                                 workloads                                 and here i asked a colleague of mine to                                 do a quick screencast recording for                                 kareem to walk you through this example                                 as we move to cloud environment whether                                 that's private or public cloud                                 we are predominantly dealing with api                                 driven infrastructure                                 which means we can treat our                                 infrastructure as code                                 what i'm about to show you is how easy                                 it is when treating your infrastructure                                 as code                                 to deploy and configure a kubernetes                                 cluster                                 in aws using terraform a couple of key                                 components before we get started                                 first of all versions this terraform                                 file essentially defines the providers                                 that are needed                                 for us to deploy that kubernetes cluster                                 next is our defining our eks                                 cluster itself and this is where we                                 give our cluster a name we                                 go in and look at the different                                 worker groups and the desired capacity                                 for each in this case we have two worker                                 groups                                 one with three capacity and one with uh                                 two capacity next is our vpc and this is                                 where we define                                 our underlying network for our                                 kubernetes                                 cluster in this case we're defining our                                 private subnets                                 our public subnets and what we're going                                 to leverage from a networking underlay                                 security group is next and this is where                                 we're basically saying                                 this traffic is allowed to come in on                                 port                                    on this ip address or this ip range and                                 or out                                 on these ports right so allowing that                                 security                                 group management for it to be deployed                                 in aws                                 and finally defining our actual                                 kubernetes cluster                                 what is it going to be called and                                 basically putting it all together okay                                 so                                 now that we have this we have all the                                 puzzle pieces let's all let's put it                                 together                                 so we're going to initialize this to                                 make sure that we have all of our                                 libraries in place before we get to                                 deploy so we're going to type in                                 terraform init                                 let's make sure makes sure that we have                                 all the dependencies                                 uh ready all the providers are ready and                                 then let's look at our plan                                 so terraform plan this is essentially                                 gonna                                 give us the plan that we're gonna ex                                 we're about to execute just gives you an                                 idea of what the end points are                                 what we've defined essentially in our                                 entire different pieces that we've                                 covered                                 and then let's initialize this all right                                 let's run this                                 apply and just like that                                 it's going to go out build out my                                 kubernetes cluster based on what i've                                 defined and it's going to take a couple                                 minutes and we'll come back and see it                                 and just like that we have a kubernetes                                 cluster which we can leverage                                 to essentially containerize our                                 application and deploy our application                                 in cloud                                 let's look at what we have first of all                                 let's                                 have let's update our cubeconfig file                                 with the latest instance here                                 and let's go ahead and look at                                 what we've created                                 so these are the notes that were created                                 and let's look at everything under we're                                 leveraging                                 cubectl here to to talk to the instance                                 in aws                                 and just like that we will have all of                                 the information here is my cluster ip i                                 can start accessing that cluster                                 i can start containerizing my                                 application and deploy my application                                 in cloud thank you for joining me and                                 thanks to kareem on that                                 so we talked a little bit about                                 infrastructure as code i'd encourage you                                 to explore this                                 some more because this is really part of                                 the modern world of application                                 development in a hybrid                                 cloud scenario                                 so                                                                    this catch phrase which was                                 software is eating the world and this is                                 where                                 businesses of all kinds became software                                 companies                                 and in fact even banks like back in                                      the fact that banks were also publishing                                 apis and becoming software                                 companies was a huge feat an incredible                                 shift                                 and change and how we looked at software                                 and who offers                                 software and who offers apis                                 and uh you know this quote from mark                                 andreessen is phenomenal which is                                 you know amazon i still remember those                                 days when amazon was just                                 selling books and then they expanded to                                 sell other things                                 and then they expanded to become a cloud                                 provider                                 exposing some of the servers that they                                 were depending on for their own                                 retail business and so you know all of                                 this was happening alongside                                 you know comparing borders which was a                                 book company that also was selling books                                 online                                 and was you know thrashing the throes of                                 bankruptcy as amazon was accelerating                                 and reinventing itself so software was                                 really truly eating the world in this                                 case                                 and yet now the catchphrase um and the                                 you know even prior to the pandemic is                                 really that software                                 uh that somewhere eating the world now                                 ai                                 is eating software that sounds a little                                 scary so this was a                                 uh a title uh by a forbes                                 uh author who wrote an article around                                 this and                                 you know really ai you know was framing                                 up in terms of adoption                                 in terms of number of jobs that were out                                 there in the demand around that                                 and that actually accelerated quite a                                 bit in the middle of the pandemic for a                                 variety of reasons                                 and you know one of those scenarios in                                 which ai has pic                                 is picking up in terms of adoption is in                                 our own coding as developers                                 and so there's a very popular tool that                                 maybe some of you some of you are using                                 called tab                                                                                                        on over two million files from public                                 repos in github                                 across multiple programming languages so                                 it's trained                                 to learn these complex behaviors and                                 then is able to use that deep learning                                 to ought to suggest                                 time saving code completions i mean i                                 did code completions with those dev                                 tools that microsoft way back when but                                 those were really simple                                 code completions this is like a massive                                 amount                                 of repetitive code that can actually be                                 used to save you                                 a ton of time as you're building your                                 solution                                 and you know the whole concept of ai can                                 seem                                 scary especially if like me you watch                                 way too many sci-fi flicks                                 i get it i can completely relate um                                 and while ai can help with sort of this                                 repetitive coding                                 humans really are still necessary to                                 solve really complex                                 coding challenges and as technologists                                 really we need to also ensure                                 that we don't inherently train our ai                                 with our human biases right                                 and so there's a significant really                                 significant social responsibility we all                                 need to think about                                 as technologists and that we need to                                 take account for especially when ai's                                 applied to areas                                 like criminal justice i'm sure many of                                 you have seen                                 some of the erroneous identification of                                 people                                 using ai in the news while we were all                                 sheltered in place during the pandemic                                 so these are the things that                                 technologists we should really take the                                 hardest part of our social                                 responsibility ensuring                                 we don't inherently train ai with those                                 kinds of biases                                 ai is everywhere an ai is certainly                                 everywhere at cisco                                 and i'll just walk you through just a                                 couple of these uh four scenarios that                                 we have here                                 on the screen um and mine weld which is                                 such a geeky                                 cute name i love it it's a technology um                                 that we use to support conversational ai                                 uh we developed this python based                                 machine learning framework                                 um and teams across cisco use mindmold                                 for a variety of                                 natural language applications such as                                 chat bots interactive voice response                                 systems                                 and automated faq answering as you know                                 it's a not a fun thing to always be                                 doing so                                 uh and as well as search so we have                                 applied this in products like                                 webex and we also use it for our                                 internal and external                                 web portals we also use machine learning                                 to define and apply security policy in a                                 multi-cloud environment                                 so whether it's on-prem or in the cloud                                 these compute instances could be                                 virtual machines bare metal servers or                                 containers                                 uses machine learning behavior analysis                                 algorithm algorithmic approaches to                                 offer a holistic workload                                 protection strategy so this allows                                 customers to proactively identify                                 security                                 incidences using behavioral analysis and                                 reduction of attack surface by                                 identifying software-related                                 vulnerabilities                                 so there's a couple of examples that are                                 on here i welcome you to explore that                                 more                                 post presentation                                 and here's an example of how we actually                                 applied                                 ai some of our ai technology in a real                                 world                                 scenario so we have a customer                                 innovation project                                 that we worked on and we used our meraki                                 cameras to learn and understand traffic                                 behaviors in a complex intersection in                                 sydney australia                                 love sydney australia used to travel                                 there all the time a great place to                                 visit and i'm missing it right now in                                 the middle of the pandemic                                 um but this it's using and collecting                                 learning from large volumes of real                                 world data                                 through the cameras and always ai was                                 able to identify high-risk                                 scenarios and intervention opportunities                                 which can reduce that traffic congestion                                 prevent accidents and literally save                                 lives                                 so that's that's a huge opportunity in                                 terms of leveraging something like ai                                 and again you know the adoption and                                 usage of this is going to continue to                                 take up which means                                 lots of great opportunities for you as                                 developers if you're not already                                 learning ai i'd encourage you to explore                                 that more as well                                 and i'm sure i don't really need to                                 talk about this much this is in the news                                 almost every day right cyber security                                 is a threat every day for us and that                                 has picked up                                 enormously during the pandemic uh i'll                                 share some of these stats with you                                 i mean                                                       just in                                                       uh google registered                                                phishing sites                                 and new organizations become victim of                                 ransomware every                                            especially small to mid-sized                                 organizations it's not just the same as                                 ones                                 there are often these these issues that                                 happen on a daily basis that we don't                                 even hear of in the news because they're                                 not                                 these big famous companies or issues                                 that are                                 nationwide and as a reminder of that                                 not too long ago here in the us we had                                 this cyber security threat uh                                 with the colonial pipeline only a few                                 weeks ago                                 and it caused a significant gas shortage                                 in the u.s northeast area and with panic                                 buying it became                                 that much worse and this hack was                                 speculated to have been related                                 to open security gaps were more                                 remote working scenarios that we're all                                 living through while most of us are                                 living through right now                                 and in fact this remote work this past                                 year we have seen a significant rise                                 in security threats globally                                    on average according to some reports so                                 it truly lands with us                                 as developers to contain this it's in                                 our power                                 to help ensure that data systems are                                 secure and yet i know how many                                 of you are feeling about this it isn't a                                 simple ask                                 to incorporate security in everything                                 you do you have to consider where data                                 lives                                 what specific country names you have                                 state regulations                                 compliance data sensitivity and on and                                 on and on                                 it really it shouldn't feel like paying                                 a tax                                 every time you have to do this it really                                 means to be seamlessly part of the work                                 that we do every day                                 and you know we're making progress and                                 there are things that are on the horizon                                 that aren't too far out                                 that we hope to accelerate and ensure                                 that security becomes a first-class                                 citizen and                                 all the work that we do so while it                                 seems like a bit of a burden secure now                                 there is a rise in security specific                                 solutions                                 and practices we can today identify                                 exploitations and code at run time and                                 collaborate                                 on quick

learnings and trends here for you                                 to consider as you're thinking about                                 your careers as                                 developers things that you're going to                                 be working on on the horizon                                 but if you remember nothing else in this                                 i want you to take a few things from                                 what                                 from this which is our work is going to                                 stay hybrid hybrid                                 is here to stay if you aren't already                                 starting to think about applying                                 software best practices                                 across your infrastructure management                                 you should do that now                                 ai is part of the future of coding and                                 if that is also here just saying                                 something for you to really consider if                                 you're not already                                 uh familiarizing yourself with ai                                 and last but not least foremost don't                                 forget about your responsibility                                 when it comes to cyber security risk and                                 ensuring that we're all operating                                 in a safe secure world virtually and                                 beyond                                 and with that thank you for having me                                 and i'll open up for a q a                                 yeah thanks a lot grace for this uh very                                 inspirational                                 uh it's inspiring keynote um i think                                  there were some some really                                  uh really good thoughts about what we                                  all uh                                  uh all experienced in the last uh last                                  one and a half years                                  um yeah let's see if there's some some                                  questions uh                                  from the audience so you said um                                  that i will replace or will                                  at least somehow                                  affect how we how we're going to uh code                                  right                                  um you made the example of auto                                  completion um                                  for instance and finding bugs do you                                  think it will um                                  like stay uh mostly as a supporting                                  uh feature or uh can can you also                                  envision                                  a world in which uh the computer                                  basically programs itself completely                                  so i i i really do believe that                                  ai during auto completion of code                                  that that will take on more and more                                  workloads over time but for true                                  innovations and truly complex problems                                  human intervention really needs to be                                  there so a great example of that is                                  really ensuring that we're not                                  inherently programming that bias that                                  really requires                                  a human person to evaluate you know how                                  is this actually operating what are the                                  you know                                  inherent challenges with how this is                                  actually automating its learning and um                                  how it's uh actually systematically                                  profiling uh the results of something                                  whether it's a person                                  and a criminal analysis or whether it's                                  you know some other scenario like the                                  traffic analysis                                  it's not always gonna be perfect it's                                  going to get better and better but it's                                  really going to require a pair of human                                  eyes and evaluation to ensure                                  that we're always using the safest                                  procedures possible and we apply                                  technology yeah thank you                                  so um this question um                                  what are your predictions for the future                                  of data science                                  ah what are my predictions for the                                  future of data science                                  that's a tough one i think there's so                                  much uh greenfield opportunity in data                                  science                                  in general right now and um it's such a                                  growing discipline in general which i                                  look at is separate from what we do as                                  application and cloud                                  developers uh feature for data science                                  i hope becomes less complex for people                                  to adopt and learn                                  and for data science practice just like                                  the                                  the operational piece of cloud                                  engineering becomes an integrated                                  integrated and woven part of the                                  business whether it's with application                                  developers                                  or the the business leaders and managers                                  who want the data analysis                                  that needs to be a much more seamless                                  piece of the puzzle                                  so i think we have a ways to go when it                                  comes to data science and how                                  that the tools are done how the analysis                                  is done and how the practice is run so                                  that it's much more                                  woven as a everyday piece of the work                                  that we do and as a seamless part of                                  the team environment as well                                  thank you oh there's one more question                                  um how can developers better                                  mitigate security risks in their code                                  how can developers better so there are                                  the ways that                                  you can do that now is mostly run                                  time-based using                                  tooling right to identify those those uh                                  risk factors                                  um                                  and the future should be really you know                                  again going back to                                  it shouldn't feel like a tax having                                  integrations with them the ide whatever                                  flavor of ide that                                  you use such that it becomes this                                  helper tool in places you're coding                                  identifying                                  the risk issues while you are coding                                  versus                                  after the fact it's great that we have                                  tools now to identify                                  risky software or ski libraries that you                                  might be including                                  but that's often sort so far down the                                  line that it's                                  harder to undo what you did the earlier                                  that you can identify                                  the issues as you're coding as part of                                  the practice the better off you will be                                  i think we're still working on getting                                  there but we certainly at least have                                  tools                                  cisco has a bunch of tools as well that                                  help you identify                                  some of these issues at runtime mode and                                  deployment mode                                  one more question um what is the                                  importance of open source                                  um you you made with the example of                                  github so what's the important of open                                  source for the                                  ability to build ai code tools ah                                  so there are a ton of solutions and                                  tools and libraries that are being                                  contributed in an open source manner                                  which is a fantastic and as a community                                  driven                                  thing which it helps to really                                  accelerate innovation                                  a big big fan of open source um                                  and they're in you know where i said we                                  all have a social responsibility every                                  time we contribute                                  to libraries like that every time we                                  look and leverage                                  these solutions we always need to take                                  the approach of being                                  a responsible technologist and                                  understanding what is what is this                                  really giving me how is this really                                  operating making sure like i said                                  earlier                                  that we aren't inherently putting in                                  biases that will operate against                                  you know certain you know factions of                                  society and and different cultures                                  yeah plus i guess it's also a good uh uh                                  learning set for for for all these ia                                  algorithms right                                  absolutely it's a great learning                                  opportunity all the code that's                                  contributed and                                  open source request stories like github                                  and gitlab and the bucket                                  and all the things yeah hopefully it                                  makes the right inferences from from all                                  that code outside out there                                  um yeah i don't see any more questions                                  um now so yeah thanks again for your for                                  your                                  amazing keynote for answering all the                                  questions that we had                                  it's a pleasure                                  you
