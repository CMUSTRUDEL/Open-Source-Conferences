Publication date: 2021-06-23
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	LOVOO's (a social and dating platform) moderation team focuses on keeping the platform free of unwanted users. Our newest solution involves using unsupervised learning to cluster and visualize users' batches within a few clicks to moderate them according to the clustering algorithm's outcome.

Behind those clicks, there's a large collection of components supporting the system. These include a machine learning service that creates the model, our whole Antispam platform, Kafka, gRPC, databases, lots of data, and more.

This talk is about the complete platform— its intention, motivation, architecture, and results.
