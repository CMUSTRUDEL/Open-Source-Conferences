Description: 
	Open source crossed the chasm into mainstream with users in all industries. Maintaining the users’ trust and sustaining innovation is key to open source’s success. However, in a world where communities are passionate, multicultural, and primarily use online communication, it is challenging to move communities towards a shared vision in a frictionless, sustainable way.

Community challenges can impact innovation, putting user adoption at risk and even more importantly, hurting community members. Stronger open source leadership can address these challenges and there is a call for more leaders in every project.

Good news! Every contributor is a leader either through self leadership, leading others, or leading the community, yet most people have never been trained on how to lead. This talk provides the leadership training you need and covers: - What is leadership and why strengthen open source leadership - Key leadership and emotional intelligence principles - Practical ways to lead in order to create a diverse, thriving community especially in today’s extreme ambiguity and change.

     just lead or just get people working                               better together i know i have                               but what if you could be the leader that                               you need and that you didn't have to                               rely                               on someone else to make this happen                                so today i want to share how you can do                                this                                but first i want to thank you for making                                time for today's talk                                because good leadership is so important                                for your projects                                to be healthy with collaborative                                productive interactions and good                                outcomes so i'm really grateful that                                you're taking the time                                to learn about leadership and how to                                strengthen your skills                                so today that's exactly what we're going                                to focus on                                what is leadership how do you strengthen                                leadership skills                                and i want to go a little bit further                                and talk about how we help                                projects have more diverse leadership                                how do we get people of underrepresented                                groups to                                step in and take on more leadership                                roles as well                                so hopefully that sounds good and let's                                go ahead and dive in with the story                                that helps kind of explain what                                leadership is especially                                in the world of open source                                so a couple years ago i was working on a                                project                                where we wanted to improve the                                contributor experience and for an open                                source project                                and we started by interviewing a lot of                                community members about                                their contribution journey that first                                experience and we wanted to see where                                the friction was                                and there was one story that really                                stood out to me as a great example                                and um it was about this                                uh this one guy                                who was new to the project and                                wanted to make their first contribution                                pretty standard right but unfortunately                                there was a problem                                this person was looking in the forums                                for help                                and was watching the issue cues and                                watching everyone interacting                                and he felt it was really intimidating                                uh the interactions weren't exactly                                positive and                                they kind of made newcomers feel a                                little dumb for not                                knowing how to do things the right way                                and of course when you're new you don't                                know these things                                and he really wanted to make this                                contribution                                but he waited a whole year just watching                                to see well now can i jump in or do i                                feel comfortable now and                                it took a whole year for him to finally                                say i really want to do this but i need                                a new approach                                and he reached out to the mentor                                somebody in the community who                                was more of a veteran and said i'd                                really like to do this                                um and i don't know how and i'm feeling                                a little intimidated                                would you help me and this person said                                i'd be happy to mentor you                                and this is you know volunteer time at                                night or weekends                                and the person gave up their time and                                helped out this                                person who wanted to make their first                                time contribution                                and fortunately it worked out                                this person did make their first                                contribution and because they have a                                learning mindset                                they were able to contribute again and                                again                                and again and today this person is one                                of the top contributors for the open                                source project                                which is just an amazing outcome                                 but it's also really unfortunate                                 i mean how many contributions were lost                                 because this person waited                                 a whole year well if you look at this                                 person's                                 contribution record they lost                                     contributions that year                                 that's what they were at they are                                 averaging and that's a lot of                                 contributions to lose                                 and that how many contributions are lost                                 because people didn't push through and                                 figure out                                 how to get started on that contribution                                 journey                                 and the answer is just too many too many                                 people                                 and it's a shame because it doesn't have                                 to be this way                                 you know people in open source they want                                 to get involved they                                 want to help that is what open source is                                 all about                                 but sometimes when people step in to                                 help                                 they don't realize that they're actually                                 stepping up into leadership roles                                 these roles aren't defined as leadership                                 roles there's no training for leadership                                 in general but specifically an open                                 source                                 and they don't realize that when they                                 start in these roles                                 their way of working sets the tone for                                 how others work so if they are not                                 having                                 positive productive interactions others                                 probably aren't either                                 because that's just what they're                                 modeling and                                 you know these newcomers they're                                 watching they're seeing all of this                                 and so it is just really unfortunate and                                 a shame                                 that this is just a challenge in open                                 source but in so many aspects of life                                 and this is why i like to give this talk                                 on leadership just so i can shine a                                 light on this area we could all be a                                 little more self-aware                                 about leadership and open source                                 so let's dive into leadership                                 and start to unpack a little bit                                 by asking who were the leaders                                 in this story the forum moderator                                 it's definitely a leader has a lot of                                 influence of what's happening in that                                 forum                                 and how people are interacting and the                                 person managing the issue cues                                 is also a leader they are not only                                 deciding                                 how what's going in to the code base but                                 how the interactions are happening in                                 that arena as well                                 um the mentor is a leader                                 offering a whole new way of helping                                 the project taking someone's hand                                 helping them with their first time                                 contribution                                 and the contributor is also a leader                                 which might be surprising                                 because it's an individual but i'm going                                 to kind of get into how                                 and why that contributor is considered a                                 leader                                 so what is leadership                                 well there's actually no one definition                                 this one                                 happens to be one i like the most by                                 kevin cruz a leadership expert and it                                 says                                 leadership is a process of social                                 influence                                 which maximizes the efforts of others                                 towards the achievement of a goal                                 so you see it's about influencing others                                 and                                 it's about getting people to come                                 together to achieve something                                 together and sometimes it's easy to                                 describe                                 what something is by explaining what it                                 is not                                 so leadership is not a title or a role                                 it is not about uh having been a ceo                                 or a manager at a company or a project                                 lead in open source                                 it doesn't require an actual title                                 anyone can lead from                                 any role and it's not a personality type                                 some people think oh i'm not extroverted                                 enough and gregarious enough                                 to be a leader and that's not true many                                 leaders and many good leaders are also                                 introverts                                 and leadership is not management                                 management is making sure budgets are                                 spent on                                 on time and people are following                                 processes and procedures correctly                                 that is not what leadership is about and                                 leadership is absolutely                                 not about power or authority                                 it is about influence and getting people                                 inspired to want to move towards a goal                                 and a vision that you have                                 there are also three types of leadership                                 there's leading organizations so                                 in a company that leadership role might                                 be the ceo                                 in a project it could be a project lead                                 and then there's                                 leading others and this                                 might be the form moderator or                                 someone in charge of the mentor program                                 could be                                 a director at a company and then                                 there is leading yourself                                 and this is about managing yourself                                 um through any kind of challenge any                                 kind of interaction                                 so that you get a desired outcome when                                 you're working with others                                 and this is what the contributor and the                                 story was doing was leaving themselves                                 they took an entire year                                 trying to figure this out they were very                                 overwhelmed and intimidated                                 but then they kind of did a self-check                                 they signed in a new strategy and then                                 they found                                 someone to reach out to that could help                                 and that that shift                                 is that person leading themselves to                                 finally figure out a new way to make a                                 contribution                                 and i'm going to focus on leading                                 yourself                                 because you can't lead others                                 until you learn how to lead yourself it                                 is so important                                 and that's because the more                                 responsibilities you take on                                 leading others leading organizations the                                 more                                 stress you're going to take on                                 and you have to know how to really stay                                 centered and calm                                 and navigate through that so that people                                 can follow you                                 through it and achieve something                                 and so i'm going to focus on                                 self-leadership for this                                 talk and it's also important because                                 open source is about all of us as                                 individuals coming together                                 we all have to learn self-leadership so                                 that we                                 have the best interactions the                                 healthiest project we possibly can have                                 so whether you're a ceo a project lead                                 or an individual contributor                                 what do leaders do well                                 they shape a vision so the contributor's                                 vision was i'm going to make a                                 contribution                                 it doesn't always have to be grandiose                                 but you have to have a vision                                 and then you need to have a strategy to                                 achieve that                                 so how are you going to do that well                                 waiting a year clearly didn't work for                                 this person they had to come up with a                                 new                                 strategy which was asking for help and                                 then                                 you need to get people on board to help                                 achieve that vision                                 and that's exactly what that individual                                 contributor did he reached out to that                                 mentor and said i really want this will                                 you help me                                 right and of course that person did                                 joined the team and took time to                                 make it happen and a leader focuses on                                 measurable results not random acts of                                 activity                                 focus goals measurable results                                 for this contributor was one                                 contribution not hard                                 of course over time became                                     contributions with success                                 and a leader fosters innovation and                                 learning                                 so when they foster innovation they are                                 using that learning mindset to                                 you know take everything that they've                                 learned from their successes and their                                 failures                                 and apply it to moving things forward                                 thinking about new ideas                                 looking for new ideas looking for                                 diverse perspectives                                 that's what a leader does and of course                                 as they're doing all of this they're                                 leading themselves and managing their                                 emotions                                 in order to get that outcome that they                                 want                                 and you need skills certain skills to be                                 a leader                                 and from harvard business review                                 research                                 they identified these skills that are                                 key                                 for good leadership as you can see                                 there's                                 you know uh inspire and motivate they                                 have integrity and honesty                                 they have drive they communicate                                 they have good collaboration to build                                 teamwork                                 good relationships it goes on and on and                                 on and what                                 you see here is that it is not about                                 technical skills                                 it's not about how great they know                                 computer science or how to                                 build something it is about                                 interpersonal skills core skills                                 and these are really important to have                                 if you want to lead                                 including leading yourself                                 and so this might be a little bit                                 surprising but leadership is actually                                 two-thirds of leadership depends on                                 emotional intelligence                                 that is at the core of these leadership                                 skills                                 and unfortunately this is not an area we                                 get a lot of training                                 uh you know in the us we joke that                                 the last time we were taught emotional                                 intelligence                                 was in kindergarten at the start of our                                 education where we're just taught to use                                 our words                                 don't punch don't punch other kids but                                 use your words                                 and you know there's just not a lot of                                 systemic training                                 in emotional intelligence                                 and unfortunately well actually let me                                 just dive in and say that                                 in case you don't know what it is                                 emotional intelligence                                 is simply recognizing understanding                                 being able to manage your own emotions                                 so having control self-awareness                                 self-regulation                                 control over your emotions                                 especially when things are coming at you                                 maybe certain emails that are                                 frustrating you and you know and then                                 it's                                 deciding how you interact with others                                 so recognizing understanding and                                 influencing                                 the emotions of others and how to tap in                                 so that you can                                 work with that person and get a really                                 positive outcome                                 and unfortunately as a species we're                                 just really bad at this                                 um so dan goleman who wrote the book on                                 emotional intelligence says only                                    of people are able to accurately                                 identify their own emotions                                 as they happen and let's face it in open                                 source things are happening                                 all the time whether it's in github or                                 twitter uh the issue queues wherever you                                 are                                 there's all there's just back and forth                                 happening all the time                                 and uh you know we are not always                                 very aware of how we're feeling how                                 others are feeling                                 and being really strategic with our                                 interactions with people                                 uh that's just how we're wired                                 unfortunately as humans                                 but there is good news you can                                 improve emotional intelligence                                 and neuroscience found that emotional                                 intelligence                                 can actually be improved with                                 mindfulness                                 and this is the act of settling the mind                                 and being aware of the present moment                                 you can achieve this through meditation                                 journaling one person even gave me a tip                                 that you should                                 have a hot cup of tea we really need to                                 slow down                                 and that's because when something's so                                 hot                                 you have to slow down or you're going to                                 burn yourself                                 or you're going to burn your lips so                                 just sit there with your cup of tea                                 watch the steam slowly drink it and just                                 be really mindful of that experience                                 now personally when i heard this                                 i thought no this is not for me i                                 am not going to start doing this i                                 really just want to work hard at being a                                 better leader                                 just give me the ten point plan and i'm                                 going to do that                                 but i did try this and i started to see                                 some differences and i also um                                 started to try this because google was                                 saying yes this is                                 actually true mindfulness helps with                                 emotional intelligence                                 they had started a program called search                                 inside yourself                                 which um really like leans into this                                 neuroscience leans into mindfulness                                 and it's a program that they're trying                                 to give to                                 googlers so become better leaders and                                 they're sharing it with the world so                                 definitely check out search inside                                 yourself                                 and they've also put meditation rooms in                                 all of our buildings when we can someday                                 go into a building but                                 i took advantage of these different                                 programs through google                                 and i felt that i was                                 doing better with my thinking                                 my interacting with people and it's kind                                 of hard to explain                                 exactly why i did feel like i had more                                 resilience                                 i had more time to sit on my brain and                                 um have better thought process                                 and um you know i really think tara                                 brock                                 a buddhist-based psychologist explains                                 it                                 the best and she says between                                 stimulus and response                                 there is a space and in that space                                 is the opportunity to choose our                                 response                                 in our response lies our growth and our                                 freedom                                 and that space is so important that                                 space between stimulus and response and                                 that space                                 happens when you pause and it's                                 mindfulness that                                 gives you that resilience and that                                 ability to pause when something happens                                 to you                                 whether it's an email that's upset you                                 or just                                 i don't know and someone told you that                                 they didn't like                                 what you submitted right                                 and mindfulness gives you the chance to                                 preserve that space so that you can be                                 more strategic                                 and how you respond so that you're not                                 just reacting all the time                                 and so i highly recommend that you                                 check out some form of a mindfulness                                 practice even if it's just                                 slowly sipping a cup of tea every day                                 and                                 you know in open source we really need                                 to work on our leadership our emotional                                 intelligence                                 and we need to build it with mindfulness                                 and that's because                                 open source requires us to work online                                 together                                 and just that environment puts us at a                                 disadvantage                                 because our brains just have a really                                 hard time with positive interactions                                 when we're working online uh                                 so when we collaborate in tools like                                 github                                 and slack and twitter we experience                                 something called the online                                 disinhibition effect                                 there's a couple things that happen two                                 main ones are that                                 we lack eye contact                                 see our brains are wired to read body                                 language                                 so we can pick up on cues and adjust our                                 response                                 accordingly and when there's no eye                                 contact                                 we can't do that and actually we reduce                                 our ability to have empathy for the                                 other person                                 and someone might say well just use                                 emojis well guess what that does not                                 help our brains                                 it actually doesn't bridge the gap we                                 still need                                 to meet that need to see people's                                 body language so                                 we have less empathy when we interact                                 online                                 and the other thing that happens is how                                 we                                 project a voice onto someone's                                 communication                                 we all do it and unfortunately when an                                 email comes in                                 or reading twitter or whatever it might                                 be                                 we are assigning a net more                                 negative voice then what the person                                 intended                                 research shows almost always                                 so when we're working in these online                                 environments because the way our brain's                                 wired                                 we aren't as empathetic as we are in                                 person                                 and we assume the worst of what how                                 they're communicating with us                                 that really puts us at a disadvantage                                 and that is why we all need to be as                                 mindful as possible about our                                 interactions                                 and we need emotional like strong                                 emotional intelligence                                 to help lead ourselves through our work                                 in open source online                                 it doesn't have to be open source now                                 we're all working from home so it's                                 you know just really for everyone that's                                 in this virtual world                                 mindfulness definitely is a practice to                                 help strengthen in this area                                 but that's not going to be enough it's                                 good to also have strategies                                 that can help you with online                                 communication                                 so here are just a few pro tips on how                                 to                                 reset when some things upset you so that                                 you respond in a productive way                                 rather than react and just make things                                 worse                                 so let's imagine you get this email                                 and it's just really upset you you got a                                 couple things you can do                                 first be self-aware that you're having                                 an emotion                                 you're allowed to have an emotion                                 you just don't want to react on it so                                 one option is count to ten                                 there's lots of science behind just                                 counting to ten and giving yourself a                                 chance                                 for things to settle in your brain calm                                 down maybe get that cortisol level to go                                 down                                 and you can start doing breathing                                 um lots of breathing techniques out                                 there that i                                 recommend you look into but the act of                                 breathing also                                 helps regulate the brain and slows it                                 down                                 again you can sip hot tea can't really                                 do anything if you're about to burn                                 yourself                                 and if it's really bad just take a walk                                 just know when it's so bad just take a                                 walk                                 because it's not worth you know                                 just fighting back you really want to be                                 in the right place so you can respond in                                 a helpful way                                 and then there are ways                                 to respond that are more productive than                                 others                                 one is using the yes and technique                                 and this comes from improv so perhaps                                 someone has an idea                                 and um yeah it's a good idea it's a bad                                 idea                                 instead of saying no i don't like that                                 which really just puts the person on the                                 defensive                                 and is hard to build from                                 um destroys trust in a communication use                                 yes and yes that's a good idea and                                 what about this that way you're building                                 off of each other's ideas                                 another approach is a design approach                                 using i like                                 i wish i wonder so maybe someone sent                                 you a proposal                                 and you can say i like this part of it                                 i wish it had also covered another area                                 and i                                 wonder if you could talk to so and so to                                 get a little bit more                                 of this added into your proposal                                 this way again you're building off of                                 something and being positive and saying                                 yeah there's a gap and i think there's a                                 path forward for you to address it                                 i also really encourage everyone to                                 look into non-violent communication                                 strategies and this is a whole talk in                                 itself but there's just                                 ways in which we can communicate where                                 language                                 is helpful some language is unhelpful                                 learn what is helpful so check out                                 non-violent communication                                 i also really encourage in communication                                 that you use                                 active listening skills                                 i use this a lot and it's simply                                 somebody says something to you and you                                 repeat back what you heard                                 that way you can make sure you are all                                 on the same page                                 before you take the conversation to the                                 next step                                 so well sally

best interaction                                 possible                                 at work in your open source project                                 wherever you are                                 but what about people of                                 underrepresented groups                                 you know there's just more to consider                                 to help people from underrepresented                                 groups learn how to lead and get into                                 leadership roles                                 and actually all of you play an                                 important role                                 in helping to make that happen                                 you see it's not a surprise that people                                 of underrepresented groups                                 like women are well just                                 very underrepresented as shown here in                                 this                                                                                                    of women who were engaging in the survey                                 identified as women and this is not okay                                 and it's actually i think that's lower                                 in this form than                                 other tech stats that i've seen                                 and we need to improve community                                 diversity                                 not only because it's the right thing to                                 do                                 but many perspectives simply create                                 better solutions it's very pragmatic                                 and you want better representation                                 throughout your project                                 and not just in the areas of code                                 contribution                                 or event planning but in leadership                                 roles too                                 and the main way to create a diverse                                 community                                 with diverse leaders is to understand                                 the challenges and the blockers why                                 isn't this happening                                 because once you can understand this you                                 can start building                                 real solutions so for example                                 women have certain headwinds that just                                 hold them back                                 and they're based on societal challenges                                 this you know we may not be able to                                 solve these societal challenges                                 within our project but we can certainly                                 understand them so we can find out how                                 to bridge those gaps                                 so here are eight of these headwinds                                 one is women they simply just don't have                                 as much time as others because they are                                 balancing                                 work and life they take on more                                 um of the parental responsibilities                                 so they're taking care of kids and we                                 all know what happened during kovid                                 this really impacted families and you                                 started to see the systemic challenge                                 there                                 and if they're in addition to watching                                 kids they might be doing elder care                                 taking care of grandparents                                 there's also just bias professional bias                                 people think that women just aren't                                 quite as capable                                 um we have to prove ourselves a lot more                                 there's actual um good women ceo                                 research from harvard business review                                 that says that it takes a woman                                 four years longer than men to get into                                 the ceo role                                 and that's because they have to go                                 through so many more steps to prove                                 themselves                                 also there's just less opportunity maybe                                 it's because we don't have time                                 to capture the opportunities out there                                 or people just                                 kind of didn't think about our training                                 or mentoring us or giving stretch goals                                 and so we have less opportunity                                 and there's also this unfortunate                                 thing that happens called a glass cliff                                 the glass clip is when women are                                 actually given a leadership role but it                                 is for something that is doomed to                                 fail projects just gonna go sideways                                 and they often give those opportunities                                 to women or people of underrepresented                                 groups                                 and they often take it because they                                 think they have to save something it's                                 like that                                 nurturing nature kicks in and they have                                 to save it they don't realize always                                 that                                 not taking an opportunity is an option                                 and what happens is they                                 uh often fail or the                                 saving the project saving the situation                                 comes at such a cost                                 they're so tired and burnt out they                                 can't really move forward                                 um these are horrible outcomes                                 especially for women                                 women don't get the same fail forward                                 opportunities right we don't get to fail                                 forward                                 that is not common in a woman's career                                 and so then they just get less                                 opportunities after that situation                                 the glass cliff is worse than the glass                                 ceiling                                 so just keep an eye out for that and                                 women tend to have more imposter                                 syndrome                                 people of underrepresented groups have                                 more imposter syndrome                                 second guessing themselves when a woman                                 goes to apply for a job                                 they think they have to be a hundred                                 percent qualified for that job                                 men they'll apply if they meet                                    of the qualifications no problems which                                 is great                                 and uh but we're holding ourselves back                                 because of that imposter syndrome                                 we also don't self-promote very well                                 we're taught                                 to respect the team it's the team effort                                 we really value these relationships                                 and also we just don't want to come off                                 as                                 you know bragging how would people                                 perceive us                                 that's another issue is just how are                                 people going to react if we act too                                 ambitious                                 um and so we kind of shut down we don't                                 do it                                 and we also just we don't dream big                                 enough                                 and a lot of times because we don't see                                 women or people of underrepresented                                 groups in bigger roles                                 or we haven't seen all the opportunities                                 we could have                                 and so we hold ourselves back just                                 because we                                 we didn't even think that we could be                                 something more than what we are                                 so sally these are some headwinds                                 they're not even all of them but just                                 this is what you're                                 dealing with in your project this is                                 what a lot of the reasons why we don't                                 have more representation                                 and it's not okay right because there                                 are actual solutions that i've seen them                                 and they are so practical that i know                                 that all of our projects                                 if they are intentional can put them                                 into pla into practice                                 so the good news is i've seen this i've                                 seen this                                 very much in drupal where i worked for                                 eight years                                 and so i want to share some of these                                 tips i've also learned a lot through                                 research that i want to share as well                                 so the first thing is you need to create                                 psychological safety                                 in your project and so when a newcomer                                 is watching how a project interacts you                                 need to have healthy interactions                                 there is a reason i started with                                 explaining what leadership is                                 in self-leadership and how to have                                 better emotional intelligence                                 there's a reason i started with these                                 strategies of how to have good                                 interactions                                 because people of underrepresented                                 groups                                 need to see this this is how you attract                                 us                                 we need to feel welcome and safe                                 and actually women are more likely to                                 encounter language or content that makes                                 us feel unwelcome                                 we're much more apt to bounce if we see                                 something that's like yeah                                 no i don't have time for this i don't                                 feel safe here                                 so i really encourage you all                                 to play an active role and be very                                 self-aware and mindful of your                                 interactions in your project                                 i also encourage you to do what drupal                                 and other projects like go have done                                 which is set values what do you stand                                 for                                 what kind of behaviors do you want your                                 community to embrace                                 and how does your community value                                 diversity                                 and how do you live that value                                 this really sets the tone and helps you                                 really think about gives you a lens as                                 you kind of assess your community and                                 how are you                                 doing living those values and then                                 finally you need a code of conduct                                 and most projects have a code of conduct                                 this conference has a code of conduct                                 this isn't new                                 but what i really strongly encourage is                                 that                                 you don't just have a code of conduct                                 you immediately                                 launch an enforcement policy                                 so that people know what happens if you                                 don't                                 have appropriate behavior and what's the                                 process                                 that you're going to use so that                                 no one is flat-footed when something                                 goes wrong                                 and no one is surprised in the community                                 that a process took place                                 and it is important to train the people                                 who are going to have to                                 enforce your code of conduct                                 so that they are properly supported and                                 know how to navigate this                                 it takes a lot of core skills                                 to manage a community so you need to                                 really invest here                                 and it's important to bridge the gaps of                                 these headwinds                                 and again i want to share some things                                 that i saw in the drupal community that                                 i think worked                                 really well i highly encourage projects                                 to um you know apply these                                 there's more there's definitely more                                 than these three                                 but the first one is setting up a                                 first-time contributor mentor program so                                 again women or people of                                 under-represented groups                                 are less apt to just lean into                                 you know the abyss of open source                                 strangers and try to get started                                 so be systematic about it start a                                 first-time contributor mentor program                                 make it easy                                 for us to find and that way we have a                                 smoother on-ramp that's designed really                                 to meet us where we're at and then the                                 next one is create easy                                 networking opportunities people of                                 underrepresented groups                                 women they don't have the time to                                 network                                 they are less comfortable networking men                                 tend to have more organic networking                                 opportunities                                 and networking opens you up to mentors                                 and new ideas new areas to contribute                                 peer support networking is so important                                 to help you stay engaged in a project                                 and so you want to make it really easy                                 for women people of underrepresented                                 groups to be able to network                                 and drupal really does this well um for                                 example at their conferences especially                                 when we could meet in person                                 they would have first time um attending                                 networking events and newcomers could                                 meet                                 veterans leaders and they had a nice fun                                 social way of doing this                                 they had um women in drupal which was a                                 social event during the week                                 that allowed um really pure networking                                 and lots of other kinds of networking                                 events                                 so it's you know we don't have to rely                                 on that organic                                 using our own free time to figure out                                 who we should know in this                                 giant global community really makes a                                 difference                                 and then also be intentional                                 about creating diversity within your                                 leadership team                                 simply put this means look at your                                 technical committees                                 look at your foundation board seats look                                 everywhere                                 and what is your gender balance are you                                 happy with it                                 you want to be really intentional and                                 start                                 identifying how you can get people of                                 underrepresented groups in these roles                                 um which is a whole you know asking them                                 and and grooming them and training them                                 these are all things that are very                                 important                                 but at least starts aiming for some                                 goals uh the drupal association                                 board aims for a minimum of                                            women on the board and they're achieving                                  it and i'm seeing it in other places                                  i'm on the open source initiative board                                  and we have more                                  gender balance there as well and i'm i'm                                  so happy to see this in other places                                  but you have to be intentional and make                                  it a goal                                  but you can't simply invite                                  a woman or a person of an                                  underrepresented group                                  into a leadership role i just think it's                                  going to work because it's not                                  they're going to have a very different                                  experience                                  research shows and experience shows                                  that these people when they are in                                  leadership roles get more                                  pushback more pushback on the info on                                  the authority                                  and scope that they were given and when                                  women people of under-represented groups                                  start to feel this pushback                                  they don't lean in and fight in the same                                  ways as other groups do                                  but they tend to go into a back channel                                  and                                  kind of work it out there with their                                  peers                                  and that's fine that feels safe that is                                  not great for the project                                  that does not create a shared                                  understanding of what's happening it                                  does not create a shared solution                                  and i don't blame them i mean i have                                  also found myself sometimes going that                                  way instead of leaning in                                  because it's exhausting and again we                                  don't have the time                                  or the comfort to deal with that and so                                  it                                  um is solvable and research shows                                  in my experience has taught me that                                  there are three                                  key things that projects must do                                  if they want diverse leadership                                  one is they need to look at their                                  governance and they need to make sure                                  their governance                                  includes these leadership roles that                                  they're asking women to step into                                  they need to make sure it's clear what                                  the role scope is                                  what that person's authority is how                                  decisions are made                                  and also how someone can appeal if they                                  don't like a decision                                  when is a decision final this kind of                                  governance                                  is so important because then when                                  someone pushes back                                  the the woman in this role the person                                  from an underrepresented group in this                                  role                                  can say no no this is this is                                  mine this is my call to make and it says                                  so right here                                  it gives air coverage                                  and i have seen this in projects um                                  several projects now                                  and so i strongly encourage you to look                                  at your governance                                  then also leaders need to be allies                                  other leaders                                  you're going to see things in twitter                                  and in forums                                  within the community you need to step up                                  and say no now none of us are getting                                  stuck up in a tree somewhere                                  as annie defranco says like you know we                                  can take care of ourselves                                  but we need allies and just by being                                  intentional                                  and speaking up pointing to                                  that governance saying pointing to the                                  values                                  however you want to handle it we need                                  you to speak                                  up and get our backs and then                                  lastly you need to invest in these                                  leaders                                  and                                  i highly recommend you create cohort                                  groups                                  assign them to a coach an executive                                  coach to be specific                                  so that together they can start learning                                  how to solve these problems                                  and the coach is there to help them                                  solve the problems too                                  this is kind of a new concept but it is                                  an open source but it is working very                                  well in many other places                                  so these are just a few ways to build                                  diverse leaders and they're not hard to                                  put into place                                  you just have to commit to them                                  so that's it that was a lot of content                                  that we just covered                                  so why don't we do a quick recap we can                                  lead from any position                                  you can't lead others until you can lead                                  yourself                                  and it requires strong emotional                                  intelligence                                  um you also need to think about ways to                                  grow that emotional intelligence and you                                  can use mindfulness to do that                                  and there's lots of strategies that you                                  can take advantage of                                  so that you learn to reset                                  when something's upset you and make sure                                  you respond                                  in a productive way versus just reacting                                  and making the situation worse                                  and that we don't just want leaders we                                  want                                  diversity of leaders and you have to be                                  very intentional in how you do that                                  so i want to thank you for going through                                  this journey with me                                  and for giving me your time today and if                                  there                                  is one thing to remember it is this                                  newcomers women                                  people of underrepresented groups they                                  are watching your project                                  and deciding if they want to invest                                  their time                                  with you and they have a lot to offer                                  so you need to be mindful of how you                                  are engaging with each other be mindful                                  of how you feel when you're interacting                                  choose to respond and not react                                  because this is how you're going to get                                  your next                                  great contributor and your next great                                  leader                                  so i hope you choose to be the leader                                  that we all need                                  thank you so much for your time today                                  thank you so much megan that was a great                                  talk we had some comments in here and                                  talking about how inspirational it was                                  and i certainly learned a lot more                                  strategies of how to                                  react or respond rather than react to                                  certain situations                                  we have a few questions here so i'm                                  going to go through them now                                  the first one is uh from someone an                                  anonymous one                                  says thanks so much for your talk how do                                  you usually promote                                  and sell the value of diversity on all                                  dimensions                                  in the corporate world oftentimes i've                                  seen a corporate commitment to diversity                                  to the outside but not delivering                                  anything                                  uh diverse on the organization on the                                  inside                                  not in leadership nor in teams yeah                                  uh yes there can be a bit of a gap                                  between what people say and what people                                  do                                  and i am just going to be honest and say                                  it starts at home it starts with you and                                  actually all you can do is control                                  yourself                                  you can influence others and so as a                                  manager                                  i can control my outcome                                  so it's not often that i have a                                  free head count to fill but when i do                                  i have a bunch of diverse candidates i                                  have already identified that i would                                  love to recruit and i've been nurturing                                  that list of people and i seek them out                                  in advance                                  just build a network and that                                  way when i get that pressure to fill a                                  headcount before i lose it not that that                                  happens                                  often in google but it's happened in                                  other places i                                  can um move quickly                                  talk to these candidates get them into                                  the process i am very very intentional                                  when it comes to hiring and so that is                                  what i can do                                  and then you know where do i have                                  influence you know                                  above me or with my peers um it's                                  um calling them out letting them know                                  i'm not okay                                  if they don't have a diverse team and                                  also giving them the resources letting                                  them know i have a bench maybe it would                                  help them teaching them how to do this                                  right so it really does start at home                                  in your own personal actions those are                                  some that i take                                  great answer um i have another question                                  that's similar                                  to um this topic and as this person says                                  i can totally relate to how you                                  described how women are treated                                  and typecasted at work this has happened                                  to me                                  at the past work where i was unduly                                  blamed for being                                  a complainer as i was returning back                                  from maternity                                  and i was kicked out within first month                                  of joining                                  and also blacklisted in the company it                                  is still a big trauma in my mind                                  any suggestions on how i could have                                  better dealt with that situation                                  was i wrong to be worrying about my                                  newborn kid                                  oh first i just want to say i'm so sorry                                  does that sound highly traumatic on so                                  many levels                                  also this happened during cova that's                                  even like another layer of trauma                                  so um uh you should never                                  stop worrying about your kid family                                  first                                  uh and if you work somewhere that                                  doesn't have a family first kind of                                  concept or                                  wanting to work with you as you're                                  trying to balance everything you need to                                  really think about where you're working                                  just going to put it out there right now                                  um i                                  am fortunate um                                  how many fronts for the kind of support                                  that i've been getting and i'm happy to                                  talk offline                                  um about that because this is a bigger                                  issue um                                  there are                                  there are strategies first i would say                                  you may want to work with the trauma                                  i'm a big fan of something called                                  semantic experiencing                                  it is learning how to heal trauma                                  getting in touch with emotions it's used                                  a lot in talk therapy but it is frankly                                  better                                  i think and it's being provided to a lot                                  of                                  leaders because it helps reset your                                  nervous system faster                                  so anyhow check out somatic experiencing                                  the other thing i'd say in terms of                                  strategies is it is okay to speak up and                                  speak                                  to power and that is hard but it is also                                  important to do in a way that you're                                  heard                                  and i am not saying that you did                                  anything wrong                                  and i'm not even sure of your situation                                  but                                  there are um definitely approaches                                  um one is getting others                                  to if they're seeing this if it's a                                  systemic issue coming forward                                  in a group um or maybe it's just a                                  change in your approach so it's more                                  solution oriented                                  or you know there's lots of different                                  ways again your situation sounds                                  incredibly hard                                  and i'm so sorry you went through that                                  um and i'm happy to talk with you                                  offline                                  you can see well don't tweet me i                                  actually got off twitter sorry                                  but i'll make sure we find a way to                                  connect yes                                  uh speaking of which if you would like                                  to you can either direct                                  message megan or also attend the                                  breakout castle house room                                  which she'll be in if you have any other                                  further questions or would like to ask                                  her                                  outside of the scope of this little                                  session right now                                  i'm going to pivot slightly because i                                  had a question while                                  you were speaking and that was um you                                  know since so much of open source is                                  done online are there any kind of unique                                  strategies that you've seen                                  that helps kind of foster that human                                  aspect of building a community so we can                                  put                                  you know pr templates and be very                                  explicit about                                  where they can get help uh or be very                                  clear about how to contribute for the                                  first time                                  but are there alternative things like                                  maybe weekly calls where you actually                                  get to see                                  people and talk to them or some other                                  kind of thing like that that helps                                  foster that human aspect when it comes                                  to open source projects                                  yeah absolutely um                                  well i think you know you just bring up                                  documentation and                                  documentation actually really bridges                                  gaps and helps projects be more diverse                                  both in terms of making it easier to                                  make that first contribution                                  right um so you know just                                  meeting people where they're at and                                  giving explicit instructions of how to                                  be part of this community                                  what's expected of each other um                                  these are really helpful tools                                  documentation is incredibly important                                  for starting to give people an                                  understanding about a project and how to                                  engage                                  but in terms of human interactions                                  um yeah i mean i think the more that you                                  can do                                  to connect at a human level                                  um whether it's video and not always                                  about the work if you can find ways to                                  connect                                  um you know maybe it's around an event                                  um and the social activities that you                                  bring into them                                  so even for this kind of a conference                                  it's online                                  you can still connect with people and                                  start building those                                  relationships because at the end of the                                  day teams                                  really have three kinds of conversations                                  they have relationship conversations                                  they have conversations about the                                  opportunities they can create together                                  and then they have conversations about                                  action                                  and what research shows is that if you                                  have a limited amount of time the place                                  to focus most is on relationship                                  building and getting to know each other                                  as humans not work robots                                  um because once you have this foundation                                  the opportunities and the action                                  conversations they just happen                                  they will just start to flourish so                                  anything that you can do                                  to connect um and get to know each other                                  even if it's like a heat check before                                  you dive into the work                                  and getting to know how someone's doing                                  at a human level really goes a long way                                  i can totally relate to that and that's                                  a great answer i joined my company at                                  the start of the pandemic so there are                                  many                                  co-workers i have not even met yet in                                  person                                  and so a really big part of                                  helping the team connect is to do you                                  know like a once a month kind of gaming                                  session with each other                                  or just doing something that's not                                  related to work and i can                                  totally attest that those are super fun                                  and a great way to kind of learn more                                  about your co-worker                                  outside of the scope of work but i think                                  that can apply                                  to this scenario as well                                  you
