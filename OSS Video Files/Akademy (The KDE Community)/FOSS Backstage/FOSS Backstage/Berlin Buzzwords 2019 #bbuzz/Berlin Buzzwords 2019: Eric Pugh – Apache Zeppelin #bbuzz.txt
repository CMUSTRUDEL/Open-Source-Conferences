Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2019: Eric Pugh – Apache Zeppelin #bbuzz
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2019 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Eric Pugh talking about "It’s a Balloon! A Blimp! No, a Dirigible! Apache Zeppelin: An ETL Engine and Data Science Notebook That Connects Programmers to Data Scientists and Business Analysts!".

Data Scientists using one set of tools, predominantly in Python or R with lots of file based data.  Engineers deploying production systems using different programming languages and primarily online databases. This is a common pattern, and leads to silos between these two groups.

In this talk, Eric will share what he’s learned in creating a project structure that will feel at home for both Data Scientists and Engineers using Apache Zeppelin and Docker. The project structure he’ll share is heavily influenced by the Cookie Cutter Data Science Project that is “A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work”, but embracing the richness of 20+ programming languages and data stores that Apache Zeppelin connects to.

He’ll demonstrate using Zeppelin to expose web analytics rollups, to do ETL processing, and to enrich datasets with NLP processing.

This talk will serve as as a great intro to Apache Zeppelin, and if you are already using Jupyter, will encourage you to take a look at this competitor! If you are already using Zeppelin, then you’ll be interested in how to use Zeppelin for more than just the core task of interactive data analytics, and indeed it is a great environment for rapid prototyping of the backend of many intensive data processing projects.

	                              excellent all right thank you everybody                               for joining me it's tough being right                               after                               our and I know it's a little warm in                               here but I really appreciate you guys                               coming I looked at my title and I                               realized I must seem very excited to be                               here because there's a lot of                               explanation points in my slide title so                                excited to kind of spend the next                                   minutes with you guys so so this is                                Apache Zeppelin and I want to thank you                                all for sort of going out a little bit                                on a flyer and looking at learning about                                a technology that I think is a really                                exciting Apache project that is bringing                                some new ideas to the open source data                                notebook field and so and that's Apache                                Zeppelin I think I also really like                                Apache Zeppelin because I thought they                                had a great logo so always like that so                                I want to jump into the presentation but                                before I do briefly let you know who I                                am so I work at open source connections                                and we're a search consultancy whose                                mission is empowering search teams and                                what that means a lot of the time is                                that we're working with search teams and                                we're working on trying to get them to                                collaborate with each other better and                                we're often working to try and break                                down some of the barriers that exist                                inside of organizations because as I'm                                sure you know search is very much a team                                sport                                it's not an individual sport and so                                trying to break down barriers is part of                                what made me find Apache Zeppelin I was                                just adding it up I've been a member of                                the Apache Software Foundation for more                                than a decade and I co-authored the                                first book on solar back in the                                mid-                                                                  is my first time to Berlin buzzwords and                                I'm very excited to be here because I                                love that the themes of scale and stream                                are a big part of building a really                                great search experience so thank you                                very much for coming I'll be here for                                the my seas conference on Wednesday as                                well so look forward to meeting more of                                you                                so why should you look at Apache                                Zeppelin right if you look at that                                Google Trends analysis between Jupiter                                and Apache Zeppelin it appears to sell a                                very daunting story right quick show of                                hands how many people use Jupiter                                alright how many people are all is                                everybody familiar with the data                                notebook what that means okay                                mostly I'll give a real quick intro to                                it in a moment but Jupiter is the                                                                                                    data notebooks right and you could see                                that there's been a lot of interest in                                it while Zeppelin has been a challenger                                has sort of been bumping around with a                                little bit of interest both projects                                have actually been around for quite a                                few years and so I'm hoping to kind of                                show you some reasons that you might                                want to go take a chance on the red line                                instead of the blue line I think that                                one of the so one of the things that                                really led me to Zeppelin is I feel like                                Jupiter has maybe missed a little bit                                the point of data notebooks right it's a                                very powerful tool for letting                                non-programmers start interacting with                                data right able to load CSV able to step                                right some basic code share things right                                working in a working sort of a friendly                                web environment but I think that that                                mentality that I am a data scientist or                                a business analyst or I'm doing some                                sort of data project in isolation is                                really thinking from                                                 thinking of today right where the value                                of a data notebook is not just in                                organizing your thoughts and making                                things reproducible but really in the                                sharing your ideas and facilitating                                discussions across multiple groups of                                people in a world where typically we                                don't all work together in the same                                office we might                                be in different locations we might be in                                different time zones we have different                                 sets of skills and we need a way of                                 coming together sort of on the same                                 level to talk about data and what we're                                 trying to accomplish so so the value of                                 these data mote notebooks is breaking                                 down those barriers so standard clipart                                 type image right there but you know I                                 can personally attest having visited                                 many organizations where I see the data                                 science data scientist data science team                                 very much separated off in one corner                                 over here and the rest of the                                 organization somewhere else your search                                 team your data engineering team the                                 people managing the ETL pipelines                                 they're very very separated and what                                 happens that I often see is your data                                 science team builds capabilities and                                 skills and technologies and platforms                                 that go in one direction say lots of                                 Python lots of are right lots of those                                 sorts of tools whereas maybe the                                 engineering team is using Java or Scala                                 or maybe lots of dotnet or other other                                 languages right and so what happens is                                 when the data science team comes up with                                 a great new algorithm change or maybe a                                 way of enriching our data to make it                                 more usable to solve problems they'll                                 come up with those designs but then we                                 basically throw them over the wall and                                 have to rebuild them from scratch as                                 part of the engineering team and I think                                 it's because these two groups are so                                 separated and Jupiter by virtue of sort                                 of being a very Python specific very I                                 just kind of run it in my laptop or in                                 my little environment not really meant                                 with sharing as a first-class concern                                 continues that bad habit of separating                                 different teams instead of helping                                 people collaborate so here's you what I                                 hope is part of the saloon                                 so Zeppelin helps me foster                                 collaboration because it removes some of                                 the barriers between teams to sharing                                 and today I want to show you a couple of                                 different features and spend some time                                 talking about them and then see if maybe                                 any of this is a good fit for your team                                 okay                                 I'm going to try and make sure to leave                                 plenty of time at the end for questions                                 but you're also welcome to shout them                                 out as we go okay said I wasn't sure how                                 many people would show up at this                                 conference with laptops but I went ahead                                 and put up a Zeppelin instance that is                                 public it's shared with everybody so be                                 kind and don't delete things I'll leave                                 that up for a couple of days and I'll                                 tweet the URL after this if anyone wants                                 to play with some Zeppelin and interact                                 with it                                 okay so we're gonna look at a couple of                                 things this morning so we're gonna do                                 the spark hello world which for those of                                 you who aren't familiar with what a data                                 notebook is it's pretty self-explanatory                                 you'll you'll you'll understand it and                                 for those who've used Jupiter right                                 it'll show you sort of how similar in                                 many ways these two technologies are but                                 then I want to show you how Sepp 'ln was                                 built with the idea that there's many                                 different coding languages that people                                 want to use and so it supports sort of a                                 variety of different languages for                                 manipulating data and then of course for                                 anyone who is a hardcore data scientist                                 right they're gonna say I'm not gonna                                 shift my platform until you give me                                 Panda right so will them I'll                                 demonstrate how pandas works well inside                                 of Zeppelin cron to automate some                                 features is one of my favorite things                                 and then touch on how do we manage our                                 notebooks if we're starting to share                                 them in a more team environment how do                                 we do revisions and manage them and                                 share them around and then I'm gonna                                 show off the solar interpreter and then                                 show you some examples of some                                 visualizations like what you might have                                 done in Jupiter                                 Zeppelin just to kind of whet your                                 appetite alright so let's go ahead and                                 hopefully live coding will work how's                                 that screen okay excellent thank you                                 very much                                 all right so so okay so let's go ahead                                 and I'm just gonna go ahead and grab the                                 basic hello world demo that comes with                                 Zeppelin                                 alright so Zeppelin unlike Jupiter                                 Zeppelin was originally built with the                                 idea that we need a better interface for                                 doing spark people use spark here right                                 and spark can be kind of a pain to                                 submit the job edit it right it could be                                 a little bit cumbersome so Zeppelin                                 really was started with the idea that                                 you would be running spark right as a                                 first-class citizen and so I'll go ahead                                 and I'm just gonna run all these                                 paragraphs and this may look very                                 similar to those of you who've used                                 Jupiter which is here is a paragraph a                                 text that gets rendered and displayed                                 and I've already run this so it runs                                 pretty fast but you can kind of see do                                 you see that the code is actually being                                 submitted to spark being run and we're                                 displaying the output right and I can                                 actually go ahead and change this code                                 right here on the fly so I'm gonna go                                 ahead and resubmit that change and we                                 should see you know debugging because                                 the print statement ran inside of spark                                 of course if that's what I get for                                 translation on the fly so we're running                                 right here just a simple spark job to                                 grab a data file of banking information                                 right and we build a data frame sort of                                 standard data frame and make it                                 available now what's nice is that often                                 the person who is creating these complex                                 data frames and loading the data from                                 CSV or                                 we're getting the data is not the person                                 who wants to look at that data and                                 visually work with it and identify it                                 right so the great thing about Zeppelin                                 is it gives us an environment where we                                 can bring together multiple techniques                                 together so here is an example I'm gonna                                 go ahead and in in the Zeppelin world                                 you have this sort of percent SQL or a                                 percent spark or percent JA Python or                                 percent sequel that tells you hey this                                 block of text is all sequel so I'm gonna                                 go ahead and run it and you can see it                                 ran and there goes my sequel queries and                                 obviously we can build some basic                                 analytics capabilities er inputs and                                 forms right let's say I'm only                                 interested in EM I'm only interested in                                 looking at people up to age                                              you can see I've changed around my                                 report I can also look at my data in                                 various ways so here is a tabular format                                 right there's a bar chart pie chart all                                 sorts of different ways of visualizing                                 them and this is one of the things that                                 I liked about Zeppelin was that the idea                                 of visualizations was was sort of came                                 as part of the package right you can                                 extend it with matplotlib and all of the                                 other sort of tools that you may have                                 used in out of Jupiter but Zeppelin says                                 hey we understand how to visualize                                 things and many different sources of                                 data can be visualized through these                                 tools and so there's lots of different                                 I'll show you some great visualizations                                 at the end of this here's another little                                 example right I can go ahead and you                                 know put in some structured data so                                 that's cool right that's kind of                                 jupiter-like and kind of basically what                                 a data notebook typically does but you                                 know it could be nice to help me share                                 in share information alright so I'm                                 going to go back to my bar chart here                                 and so link this paragraph                                 and now I've got a unique link right                                 here that I can deploy so Zeppelin is                                 definitely heavier than Jupiter right                                 like there it you know you wouldn't                                 necessarily run it on your laptop right                                 if it's just you so there's a little                                 more work to deploying it but it also                                 means that it makes it really easy I can                                 take this URL I can tweet it I can email                                 it to it and someone else can jump in                                 and come and see this at this report and                                 they can manipulate and mess around with                                 it you can see here we're changing the                                 data right right there and it's querying                                 underneath and this could be great if                                 you want to expose some knobs and dials                                 for playing with the data to somebody                                 but maybe you don't want to give them                                 the raw sequel statements to manipulate                                 right makes sense folks sad so yeah so                                 that's one of the things that I really                                 like about Zeppelin is this idea that I                                 could share individual reports drop them                                 into an iframe you can also go ahead and                                 you know take the entire report and make                                 it you know the entire webpage and make                                 it a report and then just share the link                                 of the entire webpage and people can                                 pull that up as well Sam so sharing so                                 that's kind of the quick hello world for                                 Zeppelin me there we go we'll go back to                                 default that's sort of the quick hello                                 world on Zeppelin sim so I earlier                                 talked about the fact that Zeppelin                                 supports multiple languages right right                                 here you're looking at scala right this                                 is just gala code right here but just to                                 prove to you that we can run multiple                                 languages here is hello war hello world                                 in four different languages so I'll go                                 ahead and write there's my groovy right                                 so I can write code in groovy I can                                 write code obviously in Python I even                                 have a shell interpreter which is always                                 fun I can do LS - al H and you know look                                 at your keys and there's a bunch of                                 security credentials you can add to that                                 and                                 and there is and you'll notice it runs a                                 little slower because there is my spark                                 job right so that's like four different                                 languages that you can play with and you                                 know as I mentioned earlier Zeppelin                                 really started out focusing on the spark                                 and being a near face of Skaar spark but                                 then lots of people wanted Python and                                 are so those are both sort of languages                                 that have full support throughout                                 Zeppelin okay and then there's a bunch                                 of other languages sim so so that that                                 that that's okay right let's go ahead                                 and let's look at that original hello                                 world that I showed you in the spark                                 version right let's go ahead and                                 reimplemented in in in in Python using                                 pandas right so I'm running this as a                                 docker image so I have no data in it so                                 I'm gonna go ahead and just run a shell                                 command and go and grab some date off                                 the internet and drop it into my local                                 environment and then you guys can see                                 that yeah so and then we'll go ahead and                                 we're loading all of the data                                 independence right so this should look                                 very familiar to those of you who've                                 worked with Jupiter and pytho use pandas                                 a lot all of that is acceptable to here                                 but you notice here's sort of a not                                 particularly pretty output right I sort                                 of just the print to the the console                                 that pad that Python does but we can go                                 ahead and because we're because Zeppelin                                 understands that a Python or a panda's                                 data frame is a data frame we can go                                 ahead and we can use sequel statements                                 against it so I'm going to go ahead and                                 just run some sequel statements and                                 they're my data comes back in a nice                                 pretty way                                 so there's a whole bunch of data right                                 so technically what I was running was                                 the Python sequel interpreter under the                                 covers but it's smart enough to figure                                 out yes that's a sequel statement I know                                 what the rates object is and that rates                                 object was created above and now                                 accessible to here and so if I scroll                                 down here you can see do these two                                 sequel statements look pretty familiar                                 right they're the same one from the                                 spark one however instead of selecting                                 from the bank data structure I'm                                 grabbing the one that I loaded in pandas                                 the Python one so let's go ahead and let                                 me prove to you that it works and so                                 there we're loading up data there and                                 again the same sequel syntax here but                                 instead of going against our spark                                 cluster with sparks equal over that big                                 data frame we're just working with our                                 local data so the point of this is to                                 sort of highlight that you know no                                 matter how you approach data whether you                                 approach it from the Python CSV and I'm                                 gonna use pandas and numpy and tools                                 like that to be manipulating it or if I                                 need to bring out the big guns and go to                                 spark I can do that in the same data                                 science notebook okay so this probably                                 though brings up some questions like                                 security and like access to data etc                                 right so I'm not gonna go super deep                                 into it but you notice that I'm logged                                 in to this version of Zeppelin as an                                 anonymous user so one of the things that                                 I liked about Zeppelin over Jupiter was                                 the idea that in a lot of environments                                 setting up access controls right we want                                 these people in this LDAP Group to have                                 access to this database right and you                                 know in the Jupiter world you're often                                 just giving people like here's the                                 here's the connection string and just                                 make your own                                 connection to the database but in the                                 Zeppelin world we can go ahead and set                                 up credentials for people that are                                 backed by Active Directory we can set up                                 single sign-on you can have access to                                 different interpreters or different                                 notebooks depending on who you are you                                 can have private notebooks you can have                                 public notebooks that you share around                                 so all of the like who is messing what                                 what data and how are they messing with                                 it is sort of thought about in this in                                 the Zeppelin environment the other thing                                 that is also thought about in the                                 Zeppelin environment is that in this                                 sort of very simple demo that I'm giving                                 right when I create a REITs object right                                 here it's accessible from all my other                                 notebooks right and it's actually                                 accessible from anyone who messes it's a                                 global variable right but I can set it                                 up where my objects are specific to me                                 so if we're in a shared environment                                 where you're loading up a rates object                                 I'm loading up my own rates data we                                 wouldn't want them to Clyde together and                                 so it takes care of all of all of that                                 so so so authentication authorization is                                 sort of a first-class citizen and it's                                 all carefully thought-out and you know                                 it addresses a lot of people's concerns                                 about hey here's all the data go explore                                 and do what you want to do so so let me                                 show you something else that I find that                                 I find often very useful so Krong right                                 we all remember do you have question                                 okay                                 we all remember cron right it's a great                                 tool right for running processes so I'm                                 gonna go ahead and turn cron back on and                                 so ceptin supports a very simple cron                                 way of running a notebook on a periodic                                 basis okay and so I'm gonna go ahead and                                 run this guy and we'll see what our                                 counter says ooh sigh                                 this was working some Python and who                                 could tell me what my typo is invalid                                 syntax to this version of Zeppelin is                                                                                                         I am looking forward to that so what did                                 I do wrong                                 all right I think I know what I did                                 wrong so these are all the interpreters                                 that Python that the Zeppelin knows                                 about right spark and markdown and                                 angular and you know Cassandra and                                 elasticsearch and JDBC these are all the                                 things that I can connect to right and                                 so I think I maybe didn't know I don't                                 know why that's not working but I don't                                 want to drag you through it so I'll just                                 go ahead and leave that in so so let's                                 go ahead and try one more thing                                 which is let's go ahead and look at some                                 revision control                                 so here's let's just say here I'm                                 pulling down this bank file right one of                                 the things is a challenge in Jupiter is                                 how do I track my changes because                                 unfortunately all of this code that                                 lives inside these notebooks is in a big                                 JSON blob right and it's nice because I                                 can do things like download or export                                 this this notebook and Metin send it to                                 somebody and they can load it up into                                 another Zeppelin and get their data                                 right but it makes sort of dipping in                                 eco changes very difficult if you're                                 just using git on the file system so                                 let's say version control so I'm gonna                                 go ahead and so Zeppelin supports get                                 right but it also supports just pointing                                 at s                                                                     seven other different systems to store                                 the notebooks in as a source control                                 system because it ends up doing and                                 you'll see it so go ahead and make a                                 change                                 let's say we want to only look at the                                 top                                                                     ahead and commit that                                 and if you're a developer you're                                 probably looking at that little                                 interface and thinking it's not like                                 what I get out of get but it's a lot                                 better than not having any revision                                 control right and I can go ahead and                                 let's see where's my compare so I'm                                 gonna go ahead and compare these two and                                 scroll down and what it's going to show                                 me is every single paragraph that's in                                 my notebook and then tell me if there's                                 differences and then it shows me they're                                 sort of a diff okay it's it's not great                                 right it could be better but it's a lot                                 better than trying to diff these                                 notebooks without any sort of visual                                 help so so that's that's that's the                                 version control and I can kind of jump                                 back and forth and look at you know this                                 was the version with the top ten and                                 then this should be putting me back at                                 there it is my version with the top                                    okay so the more you want to share these                                 notebooks the more you want lots of                                 people to play with them obviously the                                 more important version control comes so                                 that you know who's got the latest and                                 which one to work with so all right so                                 let me go ahead and pull up one of the                                 interpreters so some are so far I pretty                                 much just showed you code running in a                                 notebook right and that's pretty much                                 what Jupiter has as well so the other                                 idea that they have is I briefly showed                                 you a list of all the different                                 interpreters that you can use with                                 Zepplin here's sort of a long list of                                 them right bigquery                                 Cassandra JDBC the more you work with a                                 disparate set of systems that you want                                 to get data and pull from the more                                 interesting Zepplin becomes because you                                 could centrally manage all the                                 connections to all your data stores via                                 zeppelin and the people who are working                                 with the data don't need to know that                                 don't need to understand how you                                 actually get to the data they just                                 to know that it's available and so let                                 me show you an example so this is a                                 solar that's out on a hosted provider                                 has a very long complex URL and that URL                                 periodically changes but because I only                                 have to update my my interpreter                                 settings right then then anyone using                                 this doesn't need to know about those                                 changes to the connection strings so and                                 then I'm going to go ahead and this is a                                 streaming query out of solar not sure if                                 Amy's looked at that I know that there's                                 another talk today Amrit is providing on                                 streaming solar queries but I'm sending                                 this big block of text which is going                                 out and looking over what is that a                                 million rows of data and aggregating                                 them to find duplicate records I'm                                 basically looking for duplicate records                                 and so and show me anyone who has a                                 duplicate record it's gonna take a while                                 because it's sort of a big intense                                 streaming job but I can mess around with                                 that inside my web notebook here I                                 didn't have to install solar locally I                                 didn't have to install any of the client                                 libraries or anything else locally right                                 I could just pull this tool up and there                                 we go I got fifteen hundred and forty                                 four nulls and then a couple of records                                 with three you know and so I can mess                                 around with my data here say any of                                 these interesting yeah so you could see                                 no stack just gonna be a little more                                 interesting there we go                                 right I keep                                 got watch how much I click in the UI now                                 you can see that there's a visualization                                 so so the idea behind these different                                 interpreters is I can just from this                                 tool here go out and write a sequel                                 statement against the database I can                                 connect to an elastic search to do                                 elastic search queries I can do                                 Cassandra queries right and all of the                                 interpreters basically implement the                                 basic syntax of any of those tools to do                                 their query sim so that's an example of                                 a slightly unusual interpreter solar                                 JDBC and those are what people typically                                 use Sam so lastly and then just to kind                                 of tell you a use case of using at this                                 tool let me see there we go so I'm going                                 to go ahead and import an example there                                 we go                                 yep the wrong one                                 so I just imported a blob of JSON from                                 another Zeppelin that from a project we                                 did two years ago and in this project                                 right we had built a search index and we                                 didn't really have a good logging                                 platform and we didn't really have a                                 good reporting but we knew we wanted to                                 start looking at what are the slow                                 queries and you know over the last                                    days over the last seven days right and                                 so the thing that I found really useful                                 about Zeppelin was that we were able to                                 point it at in this particular case it                                 was a solar index which was where we                                 were just touring that data and I was                                 able to put together very quickly a                                 bunch of different queries and                                 dashboards and then we shared this                                 around and so we were able to look and                                 understand what the query behavior was                                 we had some pretty charts about how long                                 the query times were taking on average                                 what our clique rank position was right                                 so we kind of put this all together in                                 Zeppelin and then worked with the                                 business say okay is this the                                 information you're looking for or can we                                 fix this or what do you want to do right                                 so it worked great we used it for about                                 three weeks and then they said okay this                                 looks great we're gonna re-implemented                                 low environment right what was great was                                 that the people who were building the                                 reports in tableau weren't starting out                                 from scratch we could point them to what                                 we've done in Zeppelin and they were                                 like oh great now I know exactly how to                                 build my reports in tableau at a you                                 know integrated with their entire                                 enterprise with all the roll-ups and                                 other things that they wanted to do sim                                 so this was a really really you know                                 this was a really quick and fast way of                                 prototyping something and then you know                                 we built the production system later so                                 the last thing I just want to leave you                                 with and let's see if this link comes up                                 so I've showed you pretty much the basic                                 out-of-the-box ones but there's actually                                 a lot of other visualizations that are                                 available so Zeppelin has a package                                 management library called helium that                                 actually packages up interpreter                                 and visualizations and all the                                 JavaScript and you can install them and                                 so Joel Bernstein has been doing a lot                                 of interesting work to take those solar                                 streaming expressions and build                                 visualizations on top of them so those                                 there's some basic ones right but                                 there's some more interesting ones we                                 can go ahead and do visualization based                                 on mapping we can do some really                                 sophisticated scatter plots and vector                                 plots                                 there's our pretty sequel aggregations                                 maybe some you know heat map kind of                                 stuff in here                                 linear regression so so I think the what                                 I'm trying to leave you with here is the                                 idea that there's a you know pretty                                 significant depth of the types of                                 visualizations that you can do and if                                 you notice there's these just little                                 extra boxes here these were all                                 installed into the running zeppelin via                                 this helium package management tool that                                 they've been working on Sam so there's                                 lots of interesting analytics inside                                 their sim so to kind of wrap up where's                                 my to kind of wrap up or recap so                                 Zeppelin is meant for teams that want to                                 share ideas right for a one-person                                 project maybe a little heavier right for                                 that and it is really interesting when                                 you have lots of different in by                                 languages that you want to work with                                 right are and Python and Scala and                                 groovy and all these other different                                 languages and multi data sorcery                                 environments multi data source                                 environments where there's information                                 locked up in a lot of different data                                 stores and you want to get access to                                 them and you want to be able to manage                                 that access put permissions on them put                                 limitations on how much data they might                                 be allowed to access there's a big                                 release that's been bubbling around for                                 probably a year now ODOT nine I showed                                 you Oh dot eight and in this big release                                 there's much more sophisticated                                 clustering so you can have a cluster of                                 Zeppelin servers and doesn't                                 which one you're working on the helium                                 visualization stuff is I think gonna be                                 really finally baked baked right and                                 then I've heard room there's some new                                 interpreters like a terminal so you can                                 jump onto a box and just it's like                                 you're working on the terminal but                                 you're just doing it through a webpage                                 or the other feature that I've heard is                                 is that that there's some work on                                 potentially to people editing the same                                 note at the same time and being able to                                 see who's working on that so those are                                 kind of the big things so thank you so                                 thank you very much other questions okay                                 just more curiosity let's consider that                                 they have spark that process is part of                                 the of the data and they create a crypto                                 table I have my pandas that also create                                 some variables can ideal mix the both                                 sources together or not yes sorta so the                                 thing that got me excited about Zeppelin                                 was when I was like oh I'll query                                 elasticsearch get the data back and then                                 I'll write it to Cassandra right but                                 what you have to remember is Ellen                                 itself is just a web app right so the                                 interpreters and things that go get that                                 data and bring it back you're working in                                 that environment right now                                 zeppelins got a lot of hooks where as                                 long as you're working through spark                                 right you can use both languages and in                                 fact in here and this in the tutorial                                 they have a little demo here I think                                 it's in this R which demonstrates                                 creating a data frame yes so right down                                 here we're creating a data frame using                                 scalar or spark right and in our we're                                 reading back from it right so as long as                                 both languages are speaking data frames                                 and spark so PI spark and spark are or                                 you know something like that then you're                                 manipulating it and all of that work is                                 happening in your spark cluster not in                                 your little Zeppelin webapp Sam and how                                 is the Jupiter you are very nice way to                                 do graphs and prepare everything how is                                 it integrated in here yeah so pretty                                 much there was been a big push to kind                                 of support Python in the most recent one                                 so I think I can you know so here's                                 matplotlib again I guys save that so                                 there is right there's my matplotlib all                                 of these sort of plotting tools that you                                 can use in Jupiter also run in here and                                 in fact we're using the same ipython                                 interpreter in the back to render                                 everything so they're doing more                                 questions                                 so since we now hurt what is all the                                 ways in which sapling is better than                                 Jupiter why do you think it's not used                                 that much so I think one reason why it's                                 not used a lot was that I don't think                                 it's particularly well known and it was                                 primarily distributed as part of Horton                                 data platform or ant cloud both Horton                                 and cloud era did some work on it and it                                 was part of their distributions and it                                 was all wired into you know all of that                                 authentication everything that those                                 products gave right I think that most                                 people though are saying well if I'm a                                 data scientist and I go to school I                                 learned Jupiter I learned Python you                                 know they're not really exposed to some                                 of these other big data type Bo type                                 tools I don't know why it's not more                                 widely used I mean I think that it                                 didn't support Python until sort of last                                 year really well right and I think that                                 was a big barrier to entry I know that                                 there's a fair number of companies that                                 actually bundle Zeppelin in as part of                                 their product so you may be using                                 Zeppelin as part of a product you just                                 don't know it because they've sort of                                 wrapped it and white labeled it so but                                 yeah I mean it's it's it's meant with                                 that like team orientation and                                 enterprise access controls right and I                                 think most people when they're thinking                                 I'm a data scientists are like well just                                 give me the CSV files and I'll go work                                 in the corner over here and Jupiter does                                 that really well so Thanks                                 yeah yeah another question in the center                                 I remember you I have used the staff                                 thing like two years ago and that time                                 when we want to integrate something with                                 spark we have to install like Tory to                                 enable this integration does it know now                                 like integrated automatically or we                                 still have to do that this kind of setup                                 so they definitely there's definitely                                 the documentation has gotten better and                                 there's a lot more packaging and                                 separate processes so I haven't had any                                 problems with docker run Zeppelin and                                 then going into the interpreter and                                 putting in my spark master right and                                 it's worked perfectly fine so yeah                                 there's the interpreter you can see it's                                 set up for local use right but messing                                 around with that has worked out well                                 they've done a lot to like separate all                                 the packages so you could support all                                 the variations of spark and I think                                 they've gotten rid of some of the older                                 ones as well which has helped thee                                 stability because that was something                                 that I experienced a little bit when I                                 first started using Zeppelin was like                                 package management dependency hell and                                 getting all the right versions of                                 everything to work together that I think                                 has gotten better maybe also cuz spark                                 maybe isn't changing quite as quickly as                                 well so another question is let's let's                                 take the wrist offline we've used up the                                 time things have the questions I'm sure                                 because around yep                                 we'll be happy I'll be around so thank                                 you very much everybody and I will tweet                                 that URL and if you want to kind of play                                 with Zeppelin and yeah take a look-see                                 at it might be the tool you need to                                 collaborate better with thank you go                                 didn't thank you Eric                                 [Applause]
