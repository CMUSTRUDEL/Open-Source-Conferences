Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2019: Holden Karau – State of diversity in open source communities #bbuzz
Publication date: 2019-07-02
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2019 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Holden Karau talking about "State of diversity in open source communities: A bi exploration of correlations, draw your own inference".

Open Source projects are a medium to expose engineers to innovation, other cultures and fast-track ways to learn more about the new leading technologies. Representation in the world of Open Source contribution has the opportunity to benefit not only the participants but the broader society. While there are many intersectional aspects to diversity, this talk will focus on diversity of region of contributors and gender as these are easier to analyze and we have more personal experience with them. Together we will explore data from projects in the Apache Software Foundation, Linux Foundation, and Jupyter family of projects.

Topics include:
- Diversity of representation of gender, working hours, and region among the different levels of a given project’s leadership (committers, PMC, etc.)
- Source of project origination
- The existence of codes of conduct
- And how creating a welcoming environment helps diversity
- Language & time of communication in comments, code, and mailing lists
- The rate & sources of promotions for project participants
- The importance of recognizing non-code contributions and how projects with better process are more diverse

	                              so yeah I'm gonna talk about                               diversity in open-source communities I                               want to be really clear that these are                               only correlations I'm not claiming any                               causal links one way or another we can                               we can certainly talk about what they                               might be but the the methodologies used                               are not such that I really feel                               comfortable claiming any causal links                                and yeah this is me                                this is boo she is my co-presenter you                                may recognize her from the morning's                                keynote where she was hanging out with                                grits she is she's really good on stage                                so yeah I'm holding my preferred                                pronouns are she or her I am a developer                                advocate at Google I'm on the SPARC PMC                                which means it's really hard to get me                                off of the SPARC project which is good                                because I like SPARC and I contribute to                                a lot of other Apache projects I've                                worked at a whole bunch of other                                companies they were all very nice people                                and paid me money I'm a co-author of two                                books which are unrelated to any of the                                content discussed here but that should                                not stop you from buying them especially                                high-performance SPARC I got a much                                better royalty deal on that one it turns                                out you can negotiate if anyone's                                interested in sort of seeing open-source                                code reviews live streamed I think it's                                more interesting than watching paint dry                                you may disagree you can check out my                                youtube channel here and you can sort of                                see the thought process that goes into                                at least how I do my open-source code                                reviews and sometimes people join and                                there's chats and people find issues                                that I wouldn't have found and we get to                                have those conversations I've got a                                bunch of random SPARC videos because                                that's a lot of what I do as well                                in addition to I am professionally I'm                                trans queer Canadian in America on an                                h-                                                                                                       I could figure out what today because                                that's coming up and part of the leather                                community and this is actually more                                related to this talk than normal                                normally I'm talking about SPARC and I'm                                just like and we should you know talk                                about where we're all from but I think                                actually it's really important for us to                                talk about where we're all from in                                open-source communities because that's                                sort of the first step to understanding                                what our community looks like and if we                                know what our community looks like we                                don't know if we need to improve                                diversity or what sort of facets we                                might want to think about so if you're                                an in an open source community I                                encourage you to have these                                conversations with other people you know                                especially if you're in the project                                management of it like where they're all                                from what their backgrounds are what                                people's biases might be and so let's                                say a conversation and so obviously this                                gives me a set of biases that exact                                details of which are like I believe                                universal health care is amazing and I                                am slightly terrified for the                                immigration changes happening in America                                and and other things like this right but                                you know this gives me one set of views                                and another set of views could be                                important too so yeah what is this all                                about                                open source is really important you're                                all here at a conference about it so                                that's probably something you already                                care about and there's also the other                                part is there's not a lot of metrics                                around diversity in open source                                communities there's their summon and I                                link to some of them at the end for some                                of the other studies but it's also this                                wishful thinking that maybe if we                                actually measure some of these metrics                                maybe we can do better right                                maybe the act of measuring will cause us                                to find ways to improve right there's                                this old saying that what gets measured                                is what gets improved                                and I think this can be true in open                                source communities as well also I want                                 to be clear like these analytics like                                 they're there in my github I'm certainly                                 a mediocre data scientist I mostly make                                 tools for data scientists so if you are                                 someone who really likes doing data                                 analytics please join me and and I would                                 love to do more interesting analytics                                 here okay and so with that I don't know                                 if any of you read the news but perhaps                                 my employer has perhaps not had the best                                 most recent reputation about certain                                 aspects of which I'm going to be                                 discussing I enjoy being paid and I                                 working at what's called an at-will                                 state so that is all I'm gonna say about                                 that but to be really clear I'm worrying                                 my personal hat that is not my google                                 hat right I'm very grateful for Google                                 for supporting this work but these are                                 definitely my own personal views                                 and not necessarily those of Google                                 Google may disagree with some of my                                 thoughts                                 cool so one of one of the things that                                 that I found really fascinating sort of                                 that motivated me to swim these I don't                                 know that X was I was reading this book                                 called the good girls revolt which is                                 about the equal employment opportunities                                 Commission in America in the                                             of the one of the things that people                                 said in response to some of the                                 complaints there and it was writers come                                 to the magazine over the transom and                                 women aren't coming we can't do anything                                 if they aren't interested has anyone                                 heard something similar to that in our                                 open source communities yeah and that's                                 that's a lot of nodding heads for those                                 of you watching the recording you can                                 trust me on this one but even if you                                 don't we can see RMS perhaps saying                                 something pretty similar about Emacs and                                 GCC right and so I think that there's                                 this belief that you know it's not our                                 problem it's just that people aren't                                 interested and I think I think some of                                 these analytics might suggest that                                 that's not the case right there are some                                 recent studies this was this one's                                 depressing home researchers found                                 women's coding suggestions were accepted                                                                                                       kept secret and                                                      their gender was revealed I mean that's                                 that's a difference and also there there                                 was just like                                                           reported being exposed to language or                                 content that made them uncomfortable now                                 that's that's definitely a thing with                                 cross-cultural communication that can                                 happen unintentionally certainly I've                                 occasionally made people uncomfortable                                 by saying certain words that rhyme with                                 truck because I don't know to me that's                                 very normal but to other people it makes                                 them feel very uncomfortable and I I try                                 and not do this but it's it's the thing                                 and this is one of the things which                                 actually made me wonder maybe there's                                 something in the language of a project                                 which might be correlated with project                                 diversity maybe there's something there                                 I should do some analytics here and try                                 and explore                                 so what have we done and so it's just me                                 and blue on stage and while I love blue                                 she didn't do any of the programming I                                 had some some lovely help and there's a                                 call outside to that later but so when I                                 use we it's not the Royal we I'm not                                 that into myself but so we pull data                                 from get meet up and we did some machine                                 learning also known as statistics but                                 with less principles and then I also use                                 some humans because I was like you know                                 what maybe I should do some surveys that                                 might be kind of interesting and we made                                 some pretty ish pictures they weren't                                 very good but I did find a lot of cat                                 pictures so just sort of average out the                                 cuteness of the cat and the graph on all                                 of the slides and and this will be okay                                 all right so to be clear this is this is                                 just correlation this is not causation                                 this is also not legal advice or                                 academic quality data lawyer cat would                                 be very upset if I was implying that any                                 of these things were legal advice and my                                 reference to the EEOC was simply for                                 comparison in no way implying that there                                 could be any direct relationship here                                 please don't sue me or my boss okay                                 moving on so git commits messages we                                 infer gender we got humans to review                                 projects and guess at the gender of the                                 participants based on the information                                 about the participants we looked at                                 project websites mailing lists and then                                 there's this bitly link which takes you                                 to the github where all of this lids and                                 pull requests are actually welcome for                                 real okay cool so what does what was the                                 data so I looked at about                                                gigs of commits and posts from those                                 projects the human review was obviously                                 sampled down because my budget was                                 limited to that of what I thought I                                 could put on my corporate card without                                 my boss noticing which is about a                                 hundred dollars                                 so there was $                                                          I actually did it three times so it was                                 it was $                                                              spread out over a few months of planning                                 and if you're watching this Eric I'm                                 sorry and thanks for approving those                                 expense reports okay cool and then okay                                 then we also we had slightly different                                 data that we used for the country                                 contributions and we looked at                                         worth of commits for that and we also                                 only looked at individuals with at least                                 one commit in a one-year window from the                                 time that I took the snapshot of the                                 data and so that narrowed it down enough                                 that I could afford to do this with                                 under $                                                               window it was just this was the window                                 that gave me work with my budgets so the                                 human data collection was done with                                 these instructions that are certainly                                 not perfect and it depends on the                                 cultural bias of random humans from the                                 internet who I can hire from a website                                 whose name I'm not gonna mention because                                 I enjoy being employed but we asked them                                 to find the gender of the user in                                 question                                 we gave them some sample emails that                                 have been sent in response to the user                                 on the mailing list so this this brings                                 in the bias of other people on the                                 mailing list but the hope was that maybe                                 people in the project would use the                                 correct pronouns for the people they                                 were interacting with especially if                                 they've been on the project for a while                                 and so so the hope was the human                                 reviewer could extract that information                                 and then we also told them to feel free                                 to search online and we try to infer                                 LinkedIn and Twitter information for                                 users some people listed in there like                                 ASF stuff but that only really worked                                 for the very prolific contributors the                                 the smaller contributors tended to have                                 less information than their profile so                                 there's definitely some bias introduced                                 there as well and then we also asked                                 them to list to all of the resources                                 that they use to try and further this                                 users gender so that when I another                                 month goes by I can pay someone else                                 $                                    on that corporate card to look through                                 the data and do a do a double check but                                 I have to wait for the next billing                                 cycle to come around otherwise Eric is                                 gonna start to get suspicious so step                                 one any any good data scientist starts                                 with eyeballing well hmm okay at least I                                 always start with eyeballing cuz I don't                                 know what the hell I'm doing so let's                                 take a look and once some of this data                                 looks like so if we group together by                                 project and we look at the inferred                                 non-male percentage and the sampled                                 non-male percentage and so we ask people                                 you know what gender people weren't and                                 there was only one person in the entire                                 dataset who came back as non-binary                                 everyone else was male or female and                                 that represents obviously the bias of                                 the reviewers to a degree but that's                                 that's why non male rather than female                                 and we can see there's there's a really                                 tall bar and so that that's an exciting                                 tall bar                                 there's also another bar in here which                                 is not from the ASF so I also looked at                                 some some projects from Jupiter because                                 I wanted to see like maybe the ASF is                                 doing really well or really poorly and                                 the Jupiter projects tend to be doing a                                 little bit better than the ASF projects                                 in terms of diversity which is                                 interesting there could be something at                                 a foundation level there but then                                 there's also CouchDB as a SF project                                 relatively high diversity for for these                                 projects and they actually do a bunch of                                 explicit outreach as well which which                                 could be correlated hopefully their                                 explicit outreach actually does have                                 some effect and and that's what's more                                 seeing or reflected here on the data but                                 it could also be something else and                                 right yeah so there are limitations that                                 apply this may under or over account in                                 certain situations because it's samples                                 and computers are terrible okay so what                                 is that really tall bar it's this                                 project called the rivet I don't                                 actually know how to pronounce it it's                                 an Apache project apparently I found                                 that out by going to their website no I                                 found that out because it was in my data                                 set and they've they've got this list of                                 people working on it it's kind of neat                                 they actually list the time zones on                                 there like people working on this page                                 which I thought was kind of cool from                                 like                                 collaboration point of view that seems                                 kind of useful information to know I                                 happen to know that in the spark                                 community for the people that I work                                 with but certainly you know in new                                 projects I'm just like I don't know                                 who's awake let me just try pinging                                 random humans so there are some things                                 that like could be unique about that                                 project right one of the things is if we                                 if we look at the people they're coming                                 from a wide variety of different                                 organizations relative to perhaps the                                 project that I work on Apache spark                                 which might be a little bit more                                 concentrated with one or two key                                 employers as it were                                 it hasn't easy to find community page                                 there's really good instructions on how                                 to get involved directly from the                                 project homepage and also interestingly                                 enough it has a lot of academic backing                                 so there was a knowledge of National                                 Science Foundation backing and so maybe                                 that encouraged more people sort of from                                 academia to get involved and maybe that                                 helps improve these numbers they also                                 participated in google Summer of Code                                 which was kind of interesting and maybe                                 that was another way that they got                                 people involved so that's those those                                 are some things you know this isn't like                                 a very statistically significant sample                                 we're looking at one project but                                 certainly we're looking at the one                                 project which definitely stood out the                                 most so that's kind of cool but stage                                 two we're going to apply science to this                                 and science is when we empty a beer can                                 into something else and then we go back                                 in time okay the Back to the Future                                 didn't was not so popular in Germany                                 okay it was my jokes are just bad that's                                 fine okay                                 so that's great but I don't really have                                 the time to go and dig into every                                 individual project at scale right that                                 would cost more than my three hundred                                 dollar budget and I'm lazy so these are                                 some of the things that we could                                 programmatically figure out to a degree                                 and I've used humans to to look and see                                 if there was a code of conduct and the                                 contributor guide but we can look at                                 things like the sentiment of the project                                 on the user dev list using sentiment                                 analysis and maybe we'll see something                                 interesting                                 with the language based on our earlier                                 study about women intending to                                 experience language that made them                                 uncomfortable so maybe there's something                                 there so there's some gender related                                 attributes that we can think of we can                                 think of the gender percentages of the                                 code contributions we could look at the                                 mailing list users there's a lot of                                 mailing list users and coming up with                                 this disability significant sample of                                 them cost more than $                                                   do it and we can also look at the gender                                 percentages of the project management                                 group and the people who are committing                                 code and then we can look and see which                                 one of these are correlated with                                 different things and we can maybe this                                 will tell us happy things so I did both                                 samples and inferred gender information                                 if you look at these two graphs you'll                                 notice they're different which is not                                 great this points to perhaps either data                                 quality with humans or data quality with                                 machines one of the two is perhaps less                                 than ideal but there there are some                                 similarities and let's dive into to one                                 of those graphs and take a look oh                                 actually let's talk about why this might                                 be the case so infer gender is known to                                 have a lot of issues especially with                                 non-american names they tend to pull                                 from like historical census data and so                                 it also is biased towards like older                                 names trans folks like the computer is                                 going to say that I'm a dude I mean to                                 be fair like                                                          you know there's there's some bias there                                 - it could also be the place where they                                 differed was on the the impact of                                 sentiment to a degree it could be that                                 our sentiment detection is off I don't I                                 don't think so I think the sentiment                                 detection is probably okay but if you've                                 got an idea of different things we                                 should explore on sentiment detection                                 definitely let me know but yeah so                                 what's our what's our first look so we                                 can see that the positive sentiment is                                 correlated with increased diversity and                                 negative sentiment is to a degree                                 negatively oh well okay I can see that                                 we'll look at another graph where we                                 have these labels readable but if you                                 trust me negative sentiment is                                 negatively correlated and we can see                                 there's slightly different amounts of                                 correlation depending on exactly which                                 thresholds where you                                 for considering and mailing was bad and                                 then there's also depressingly the                                 existence of a mentoring guide is                                 negatively correlated which was                                 surprising we'll talk about that more                                 later and perhaps I mean in a nice way                                 we do see that the inferred non mail                                 percentage and the sampled non mail                                 percentages are strongly correlated                                 together if they weren't I would be very                                 worried about our data quality but they                                 are strongly correlated so even though                                 there are some questions around data                                 quality it is good enough for for me so                                 if we if we just focus on mailing lists                                 we can see that the average negative                                 sentiment and the                                                        sentiment are both negatively correlated                                 with increased diversity on a project                                 and the positive ones are are also                                 positively correlated so I mean this                                 doesn't necessarily give us a causal                                 link right like maybe more diverse                                 projects tend to have more neutral or                                 positive sentiment in that you know we                                 may just be aware that we're                                 communicating across cultural boundaries                                 like how I learned not to say things                                 that rhyme with truck or it could be                                 that you know people are turned away                                 from this when they see negative things                                 on the mailing list it's it's hard to                                 say which one it is but I would                                 encourage you to to use this information                                 to perhaps get rid of the on                                 your mailing list insofar as you can                                 because they probably weren't adding a                                 lot anyways and it might help you                                 increase the diversity of your project                                 okay so the the committer guide that one                                 was bad okay so on on on a positive side                                 non mail committer percentage is                                 strongly correlated with increased                                 diversity of contributors and this could                                 just be that were like pulling from that                                 contributor pool to make our committers                                 and that's good right like if this was                                 not strongly correlated that would make                                 me sad that would mean that we're not                                 like pulling from that pool we're just                                 pulling from the pool of dudes and so                                 this is this is good                                 or                                 could also be that having nominal                                 committers tends to attract more non                                 male contributors who knows but yeah                                 whatever it's cool on inferred data it                                 looks pretty similar but the the exact                                 values are a little bit different and so                                 that's that's reassuring to a degree                                 it's not quite the same but it's you                                 know it's good so yeah interestingly                                 enough the code of conduct being                                 explicitly declared on the project page                                 was was not correlated it was just                                 neutral and this could be that we're                                 pulling from ASF projects right all ASF                                 projects are like part of the Apache                                 Software Foundation which does have a                                 code of conduct so it could just be like                                 kind of neutral when your project says                                 it because like in practice yeah we're                                 all supposed to be not to each                                 other or maybe it's something else the                                 mentoring I want to really confuse me I                                 don't have a good explanation for that                                 but that's okay you you all can come up                                 with a reason for that this does not                                 mean go delete your mentoring guides                                 this just means like maybe take a look                                 at them maybe the mentoring guides tend                                 to have language which makes people not                                 happy maybe there's something there and                                 our meandering guides that we should dig                                 into and see what's going on maybe                                 there's there's some opportunities for                                 improvement there so one of the other                                 things that I was curious about is the                                 impact of programming language and this                                 did not match my expectations at all                                 when I made this chart yesterday well                                 actually technically this morning                                 because I reran it because I didn't                                 trust myself but we can see here that                                 some languages are you know they they                                 seem to have higher percentages so this                                 is I should I should explain this is the                                 programming language and this is the                                 min/max and average of the projects that                                 are have that as the primary programming                                 language of what their diversity numbers                                 are on gender and python is just zero                                 across the board which is not the answer                                 I was expecting right and one of the                                 things is that this is actually just on                                 the NSF data it's not on the Jupiter                                 data if it was on the Jupiter data and                                 it gave me back zero                                 the board I would have been like mmm                                 well it's time to delete that graph but                                 if we dig into this we can see there's                                 not a lot of Apache projects with Python                                 as their primary detected language so                                 each project was only assigned one                                 language and it was whichever one github                                 decided to assign to it which we all                                 know is perfect but you know perhaps you                                 know one could argue that that spark                                 really should be Scala and Python and                                 then we'd get different numbers but this                                 was the the easier approach and so since                                 there's only like one or two projects in                                 the Python one I think we should                                 probably just discount this field and we                                 can look at the other ones other ones                                 all have some reasonable number of                                 projects in them and this is interesting                                 we can see that there is certainly a                                 fair amount of variance inside of some                                 languages so we can see that there are                                 more diverse skala projects and less                                 diverse Scala project so it's not simply                                 a matter of reflecting the programming                                 language that we're pulling from we can                                 certainly see that there's a difference                                 between the min and the max and the                                 average there so that's kind of                                 interesting right we can't just use the                                 programming language excuse and just be                                 like no one likes Java because it turns                                 out some people really do who aren't                                 male and and they contribute to ASF                                 projects right and that's that's really                                 awesome so it's not just that we use                                 Java a lot not that there's anything                                 wrong with Java well there is a lot but                                 okay yeah okay so so the other question                                 which I had because how many of you have                                 become a committer on an Apache project                                 okay keep your hands up if you felt that                                 process was fair and easy okay so it got                                 cut by half and so one of the things                                 that I was curious is you know perhaps                                 it's it's possible that because many                                 projects tend to submit tend to select                                 committers by consensus voting that                                 maybe we're allowing biases Don                                 intention                                 creep into that process right consensus                                 voting is like everyone agrees no one                                 vetoes and this is how you end up eating                                 at in America the Olive Garden oh sorry                                 no no the Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake                                 Factory okay you do not have olive                                 garden or Cheesecake Factory here but                                 it's how you end up eating somewhere                                 really bland and mediocre right when                                 you're just like all of your friends                                 anyone who has any objection can just be                                 like no right and so maybe this is                                 leading tool blender project makeup it                                 looks like maybe not so much we tend to                                 see right as we saw in that correlation                                 slide earlier that the there there is a                                 correlation between the number of                                 non-male contributors and the number of                                 non-male committers and we we tend to                                 see that broken out for most projects                                 some of them though are certainly very                                 different and if you want you can look                                 at this graph later with like a                                 magnifying glass or you can go to the                                 the the bitly link where the thing                                 notebook is and you can you can look at                                 this graph specifically yeah okay so                                 gender is one of many aspects of                                 diversity of a project there's also                                 where people are from and it turns out                                 there are a lot of people from Germany                                 so a good job the u.s. is probably                                 undercounted here on the basis of that                                 whole calm thing which was just blew                                 everything out of the water but calm is                                 is sufficiently popular for just all                                 commercial organizations regardless of                                 country that it was kind of difficult to                                 figure out where folks were from and so                                 this is this is kind of interesting we                                 see this this trail off Canada is here                                 yeah anyone else from Canada yeah go                                 team okay so like Canada is in the top                                 five and like as Canadians I feel like                                 that's the Canadian version of gold so                                 you know                                 you don't want to be number one right                                 because then that's that's just wolf                                 that's a lot of apologies sorry                                 cultural stereotypes um but they're                                 there for my own culture so I think it's                                 okay that's how it works right okay                                 moving on                                 uh-huh okay and so if we if we take                                 uniques rather than just looking at all                                 of the contributions right so if like I                                 contribute                                                            you know                                 do we count me as one or                                               do this the graph ends up looking pretty                                 much the same so it turns out that it's                                 not just like there's a bot in Germany                                 that's contributing hundreds of                                 thousands of patches well there may be                                 but that's not the only reason why or if                                 there is that bot is changing its email                                 address a lot and you're probably gonna                                 get banned from the github API so okay                                 so this is this is kind of interesting                                 there too and there's there's a lot of                                 other facets that we could explore here                                 besides gender but they're all really                                 hard and when you will have a budget of                                 about whatever you can sneak past your                                 boss it's not a great budget right and                                 so I really think that if we should                                 explore a lot of these things we often                                 talk about diversity of employers and                                 Apache projects and I think that would                                 be a good thing for us to explicitly                                 study outside of just you know PMC and                                 committers I think it makes sense to                                 look where the contributions on the                                 mailing list are coming from                                 I think certainly all of these other                                 facets are all really exciting too and                                 we should we should explore them but I                                 can't do it for $                                                     would save perhaps asking the ASF for                                 money to do diversity work you know                                 maybe this could be an interesting area                                 that we could use to figure out where or                                 how we should focus our efforts to truly                                 reflect the world that we're serving                                 there's a whole bunch of related work                                 and it's all really depressing but if                                 you're tired of being happy I encourage                                 you to check out these links are as I                                 like to say everything is awesome yes                                 yes awesome right I don't actually if                                 you want to see video                                 of a spark committer struggling to use                                 spark there's this lovely bitly link                                 down at the bottom where and I try and                                 use the software that I've worked on for                                 six years and it turns out that the                                 sufferer that I've worked on is have                                 some opportunities for improvement to                                 use a phrase that I've seen every                                 performance review and so you can check                                 that out there and hopefully that that                                 makes you feel confident enough that you                                 can help contribute to doing these                                 analytics with me and special thanks                                 this wasn't just me there were many                                 lovely people and Spencer who is my                                 former Riley editor she's the head of                                 content at Domino data lab did a lot of                                 early work with me on this Matt gave an                                 earlier version of this talk with me and                                 pointed out that the graphs looked like                                  they still do but less so and I                                 added cat pictures so that helps right                                 and and Chris did the geographic                                 analysis which was it's very useful if                                 you want to participate please come and                                 join me doing this work by yourself is a                                 really good way to feel really sad about                                 the world and if you get multiple people                                 together working on diversity stuff when                                 you burn out you know you've got someone                                 else to talk to so that's useful you but                                 you might burn out I'm just fair warning                                 and you could say hi I'm gonna be around                                 Berlin for the next few days and if I                                 manage to do like one business meeting                                 between now and when I leave it'll look                                 a lot less sketchy on my expense reports                                 otherwise I'm swimming by the beam                                 summit okay so how does a book author of                                 a book that is admittedly completely                                 unrelated to this talk I would be remiss                                 if I did not try and tell you about my                                 book you should buy it okay great moving                                 on if anyone is interested in teaching                                 distributed computing to children and                                 and this is this is not a joke this is                                 actually a project that I'm working on                                 distributed computing for kids comm you                                 and give me your email address and                                 because you're European I won't spam you                                 I will selectively contact you for                                 business-related reasonings and there is                                 an unsubscribe link as mandated by law                                 anyways I think we can teach Apache                                 spark to children preferably children                                 who live in Europe and not America so I                                 don't have to answer their questions and                                 so that is my hope there okay so I                                 wanted to save the last of it for Q&A                                 and we can discuss these analytics we                                 can look at the notebook and you can see                                 my really janky Python code know that                                 I'm a scholar developer so that's my                                 excuse but does does anyone have                                 questions I would I would love to or                                 thoughts questions anyone Oh clearly I                                 am just an amazing public speaker who                                 has answered everyone's possible                                 questions yes does anyone want to look                                 at a mediocre Python notebook oh that is                                 not the answer I was expecting okay here                                 is a mediocre Python notebook okay yeah                                 so we can go up to the top okay                                 we'll ignore all of the spark setup                                 stuff because it's terrible okay more                                 spark setup more spark setup Oh some                                 things that really should be functions                                 in spark moving past that okay here's                                 where we extract the meetup data which I                                 never got around to or analyzing if                                 anyone wants to analyze the meetup data                                 I have a bunch of it I think it would be                                 interesting to see if maybe like having                                 meetups in different countries is                                 correlated with any of these things I                                 think that could be a thing which might                                 actually be really relevant yeah and so                                 there's a bunch of it that's just                                 commented out because I do that we use                                 Percival to extract a lot of data from                                 github Thank You github for not blocking                                 me I really appreciate that although                                 they do occasionally if you run this                                 notebook on your own be prepared to be                                 rate limited                                 by github but they don't they don't turn                                 your account off not a guarantee uh okay                                 save our data super happy fun times I                                 import a Python library which is                                 actually secretly a jar because I use                                 SPARC we look at some users there's                                 these two grant and Carl what's up then                                 we use regular expressions two parts                                 email addresses because I hate my life                                 and yeah we also try and extract names                                 from email addresses because I was going                                 to try and do some analytics on the                                 mailing list but that regular expression                                 had some opportunities for improvement                                 so if you like writing regular                                 expressions come join me we look at the                                 distinct authors we look up get up users                                 by email address so we we got their                                 commits and then we go and we find their                                 github profile to try and get any                                 information that might be present about                                 them                                 we also fetched their user BIOS some                                 people put their pronouns in their bio                                 please put your pronouns in your bio                                 it's really helpful when I run this                                 pipeline but also it's just good and it                                 sort of normalizes that process which I                                 think would be would be good for the                                 world we have this really high quality                                 UDF that just uh yeah that that sleep                                 randant mmm that's some quality stuff                                 this gets the language for a project so                                 we get the committee's and then we get                                 their languages I use this thing called                                 known blocking DF saver load also known                                 as my notebook keeps crashing and so I                                 just wanted to save them it's terrible                                 but it works aggregate a bunch of data                                 oh yeah I tried to scrape crunch base                                 but yeah as this comment says robots.txt                                 seems to be okay with it for now last                                 checked April                                                        think they are anymore so it's commented                                 out we don't actually run that                                 extraction anymore I think they got                                 frustrated but crunch please had a bunch                                 of information about                                 open-source contributors for some reason                                 I don't know who put that information in                                 there but thanks get their information                                 do a bunch of stuff with it check that                                 my sentiment analyzer correctly detects                                 the difference in sentiment between                                 these two sentences and then we extract                                 sentiment across all of the mailing list                                 posts for a project yay and then there's                                 a whole bunch of repartition encase a                                 spark and life is terrible                                 ignore the exceptions once again this is                                 spark that exception actually means                                 everything is going ok that's on my to                                 fix list ok                                 we do a bunch more do a bunch more                                  more more no well you know when I                                 find something interesting again okay oh                                 right we compute the sample sizes so                                 that they're like actually statistically                                 significant what's there oh yeah and                                 then this is where I computed the sum of                                 the sample size to make sure I could do                                 it under budget and I kept changing the                                 constraints until I got a input that                                 resulted in a small enough sample size                                 so that's how we ended up with the one                                 year window and then we do a bunch of                                 other stuff but I'm down to five minutes                                 left so if you want you can read this                                 notebook I actually have a question oh                                 cool do you have tips to actively make                                 your project or the meetups etc more                                 diverse that's a great question I don't                                 I so I think working with groups like a                                 Trichy can be really good if you're                                 organizing like physical events making                                 sure they're inaccessible locations                                 maybe doing things that aren't just                                 drinking after work because I feel hella                                 uncomfortable getting drunk with a bunch                                 of programmers that I don't know and I                                 imagine there are other people who also                                 have similar comfort challenges around                                 that there's there are good resources                                 about that this is all just correlations                                 though and they don't I                                 I was hoping if I stuck to correlations                                 I wouldn't get yelled at                                 so I I don't want to go too much to                                 specific advice but you should talk to                                 Gris who's seeing right behind you when                                 the camera is not running or you can ask                                 me again when the camera is not running                                 look that works too I did you maybe I                                 missed it but did you get a chance to                                 like look at the diversity by country                                 like the certain countries do better                                 than other countries oh no I didn't                                 that's a great next thing to do yes                                 it'll be one group by away and pull                                 requests welcome yeah                                 I'm gonna go get lunch but after that                                 I'll be back if you want them if you                                 actually want to okay that's I think                                 we're good yeah awesome thank you very                                 much holding no thanks everyone for                                 coming                                 [Applause]
