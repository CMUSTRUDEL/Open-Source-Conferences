Description: 
	Sirar Salih talking about "Not automating Tinder in the Cloud and the day I didn't break Tinder by accident".

It was a cold day in December of 2018, I was sitting with my developer friends at a local pub in Oslo. Inspired by our conversations, I got the idea to finally fix the "Tinder problem". We're all so tired of swiping, it's about time we automated this thing! Never did I imagine what I'd get myself into, the intrigues and the drama that would follow. 

Sure, investigating the Tinder API was easy enough. Sure, building an Azure Function and deploying it to the cloud to fully automate Tinder was not a big deal. But eventually getting my account locked by Facebook and finding a security threat in the OAuth 2.0 protocol?! The Tinder service coincidentally going down and seeing this event unfold all over the media?! Never did I imagine I'd have so much fun and learn so much along the way.

know we're like we're an interesting you                                know type of people type of people                                basically we're curious we like to                                investigate we like to break things at                                least I like to break things maybe we                                don't mean as festive as it happens and                                we like to just you know to find out new                                things right so and you know you know                                we're living in this API age right we're                                pretty much every service out there has                                an open API right and tinder actually                                has an open API and that's quite                                interesting but just like kind of like a                                discretion                                you know before I do this talk is that                                I'm not promoting you know automating                                this in their service because it's not                                allowed you know it's actually not a lot                                so tinder is has very strict rules they                                have Terms of Use which states what you                                can do when you use their service and                                what you cannot do and if we try to                                automate their service we are not using                                their app and then they get really angry                                right so so this is like an                                experience-based talk I'm gonna tell you                                what happened basically this year for me                                when I try to                                I was very curious and I did some things                                and then some stuff happened and then                                some drama happened and then you know                                the whole thing so I hope that that can                                kind of you know tell others tell other                                developers and other people out there                                that you know you know this is how it is                                if you want to work with tinder tinder                                API basically all right so that's why                                you see this is a kind of a like a

room so you know this                                whole story it started this place here                                that you see on the on the slide and                                this is a local pub in Oslo it's called                                the Oslo mechanical like also a                                mechanical recall Factory that's the                                name of the pub that's because it was a                                factory back in the old days and then                                they you know eventually they shot down                                the factory and then it became a pub and                                it's a famous pub in Oslo and I was                                there with a couple of my friends a                                couple of my developer friends back in                                December                                                              some beer and we're just talking you                                know and we were talking about this                                tinder thing right so you know I'm gonna                                explain what tinder is all about for                                those that don't use the app but um                                you know when you stand er you get this                                you know suggestions of people you get                                 pictures of people right in the app and                                 then you have                                 swipe right for saying yes that you like                                 the person and then swipe left if you                                 say no we don't like the person and if                                 two people swipe right that they like                                 each other they will get a match and                                 then they can start chatting so we were                                 talking and thinking and then like you                                 know why do we waste our time doing                                 these swipes how about we just get                                 instant matches right so so this is this                                 is like if you use the app a long time                                 you will get you know really you know                                 maybe will get frustrated like that I                                 guess we got frustrated you know so so                                 you know let's get instance matches and                                 then we can just meet people you know so                                 here's here's you can see this is how it                                 works so basically when you get the                                 match and then then you can get you know                                 you can send a message or you can just                                 keep swiping you know like to see others                                 so so a couple of beers and then you                                 know developers you know we got a little                                 drunk we got very creative suddenly and                                 then you know we're thinking okay how                                 about just Auto swipe right right so if                                 you just if you just swipe right all                                 time if you just like everybody                                 statistically you'll get a match all                                 right it's simple mathematics so we do                                 that and then we don't need to do this                                 wiping ourselves anymore and you know                                 and then it just takes off from there                                 you know we can we can write this thing                                 we can distribute it in a cloud we can                                 you know we can use the cloud and then                                 we have a distributed data center doing                                 swipes for us and we don't need to do                                 anything we just sit there and then get                                 the matches and then I can talk to the                                 people so it's really interesting                                 interesting you know problem to solve so                                 a couple of beers at that local pub in                                 Oslo and then you know I went home and                                 then I started coding because I was born                                 and that's what I do when I when I'm                                 very very bored and a bit drunk so then                                 so then so then actually I did this it I                                 did it and it works so this is a                                 screenshot showing you showing you the                                 scripts that I wrote basically that                                 talks to this in their API and then just                                 does the swiping it does the you know                                 like swiping right all the time and it's                                 doing that                                 very very frequently I believe this is                                 doing this like you know                                            second or something so it's very fast so                                 yes as you can see I had to of course I                                 have to censor the names of the people                                 because this is just you know the                                 console showing you what the code is                                 doing basically so so I just I just                                 censored all the names of the people                                 here to you know to protect their                                 privacy but in any case you get only the                                 first name in any case you know with                                 tinder so                                 tinder you know also works very hard to                                 protect the privacy of people so and you                                 as you can see you know I I got all like                                 every data I wanted I got it from the                                 API even I got some information that                                 actually isn't in the app but after some                                 conversations with tinder they assured                                 me that you know this data is you know                                 it's not so one of the things is that I                                 I got actually the birthdate of people                                 right from the from the from the cinder                                 servers from the API and that thing that                                 you don't get that in the app and this                                 is you know this potentially this is a                                 major breach of data protection you know                                 protection protection laws but tinder                                 told me that the actually the birth                                 dates are fake all right                                 they said to me that only the year is is                                 is correct the year is correct but the                                 rest of the you know the of the date                                 time field is faked out and I believe                                 them I completely believe them because                                 because I noticed that I was getting                                 matches and then and then I got I was                                 you know the birth date of people was                                 very close to each other you know so                                 when I got a match in January for                                 example I saw that the girls they had                                 like their birthday like very close to                                 each other so and sometimes got like                                 matches the same day so everyone had the                                 same like birthday on the same day and I                                 was like what really is that true                                 I'm like really that's a very you know                                 coincidence in that case but on tinder                                 said that you know this is just fake so                                 okay so we believed them so yeah so you                                 got a lot of data to work to play around                                 with right from the API which I found                                 really really cool as you can see in a                                 slide here you'll see that you know also                                 the location is printed out right so                                 tinder works so that they use the                                 location that you have on your phone                                 right on your GPS and and so you don't                                 need to think about the location like                                 you know storing the location locally                                 anywhere because the tinder tracks your                                 phone they have your GPS they have your                                 location and saved at their service so                                 that means you can create apps you can                                 do whatever you want and get your                                 location from tinder based on your phone                                 right right so basically this script of                                 mine if it's running let's say it's just                                 running in the clouds and then I I                                 traveled to Germany then when I when I                                 enter Germany is gonna swipe right on oh                                 everyone like all the women in Germany                                 and I go to to Paris it's gonna swipe                                 right on hold on do all the woman in                                 German in Paris right I don't need to do                                 anything about the location it just                                 works magically right so if you like                                 jumping around in Europe is just swiping                                 all the time but again this is not this                                 is not legal what I'm doing here just so                                 you know so but you know so you get the                                 idea here it's pretty cool it's pretty                                 cool actually actually a friend of mine                                 when I did this friend of mine said you                                 know you should create a heat map that                                 would be really awesome you can see like                                 you know where's the most matches and                                 stuff like more visualized yeah                                 interesting yeah okay so so I wrote this                                 thing the script and then I you know I                                 deployed it to Azure because I'm like an                                 azure freak you know I work with                                 Microsoft stuff so I put it in a sure                                 and then it was distributed you know and                                 then suddenly you know it started                                 working so I was getting matches like a                                 lot of matches without doing anything so                                 pretty interesting so the hypothesis                                 worked out right                                 those crazy developer guys at the pub                                 actually you know we were right about it                                 we did it actually proved the point so                                 statistically you'll get a lot of                                 matches without having to do anything if                                 you just wipe rights on everyone but                                 then of course if you you know if you                                 got a match with someone that's you                                 maybe you don't you know                                 you know you're not attracted to that                                 person then you don't need to you don't                                 need to worry about that you just not                                 talk to the person and you know it's a                                 naive thing naive approach here going on                                 okay and then you know of course you                                 know when you're when you're writing                                 code it doesn't stop it doesn't stop at                                 a you know at a place at a stage you                                 always have to do some more and more and                                 more you know have you experienced this                                 you know this phenomenon like when                                 you're building something we just want                                 to extend it extend with more stuff with                                 more cool stuff with more you know so                                 then I set up you know I set up like                                 email notifications from address so that                                 so that basically every time I get a                                 match I'll get an email and then you                                 know in the email it gets all everything                                 the pictures as well all of this stuff                                 directly to my inbox you know of course                                 of course there is notifications and the                                 tinder app but and this is completely my                                 opinion and my experience it doesn't                                 work for me with notifications                                 it's not working I don't know why it's                                 buggy or whatever like the tinder app                                 but this thing here that this actually                                 worked better and it wasn't a lot of                                 code either it's like very simple and in                                 addition you can since you're getting                                 all the data from the API you can even                                 make notifications you know even better                                 so that you can send the pictures for                                 example directly to your inbox you don't                                 you don't have that today and it's in                                 your app since we're app today you'll                                 just you know you'll get an email saying                                 that oh you got a match you know click                                 here to talk to the person so they                                 direct you to their app basically but                                 but here you can you know you can mix                                 and tricks as you want but again it's                                 not allowed so then so then so I open                                 the email I get the pictures right and                                 then as you can see there you have like                                 the age and all and you know number of                                 photos stuff like that you can play                                 around it's just data open data so okay                                 so I did all that it was fun you know                                 and you know lots of fun and then this                                 happens so tinder went down actually so                                 I was writing code and you know working                                 with the script and then suddenly the                                 service was down and I was getting like                                 five out of three and you know what the                                 heck is going on                                 I like I never experienced something                                 like you know it said like no back-end                                 server is at capacity that was the error                                 from tinder of course you know                                 developers are paranoid people as well                                 we're paranoid so I was like in full                                 panic whoo did I did I break tinder you                                 know of course we love drama so I                                 thought that you know I broke tinder and                                 you know this but of course I mean it's                                 a very low probability that you know you                                 have a script because my script was                                 running for like eight days                                 consecutively in the cloud and it was                                 doing like lots of likes you know like                                 as I mentioned to you like                                            second or something and it was running                                 for eight days you know I didn't I                                 didn't do it it wasn't a DDoS attack                                 here you know I wasn't doing that right                                 tinder but uh and it I would be very                                 surprised if that very small script took                                 down their service                                 I mean cinder has like                                                  around the world and they have ten                                 million active users so yeah pretty sure                                 this was a coincidence a pure                                 coincidence but it was interesting                                 nonetheless because you know as you can                                 see it happened here's the time those                                 there is also the day you know it was                                 the                                                                     it was like a full chaos and social                                 media so as you can see here people are                                 like panicking you know like all right I                                 met my future partner you know and all                                 this and then you know tinder went down                                 and they lost everything you know                                 so people very sad about this and you                                 know and stuff yeah ok so here's a                                 screenshot showing you you know for for                                 the tech one sticky ones in the room I                                 know that there's a lot of you in the                                 room here's a screenshot showing you                                 what what I saw while debugging my                                 application on the same day that this                                 happened and this is the code basically                                 as you can see here I've marked out the                                 day time just like a proof that this                                 happened at the same time that I was                                 working with my codes and you know the                                 service was service unavailable back-end                                 servers at capacity                                 pretty interesting alright so as I                                 mentioned to you the API is open but                                 there is no tinder doesn't want                                 developers to do this stuff you know                                 like what I did so they don't have like                                 any documentation on their API so so                                 like we're not supposed to work with the                                 API basically so people are creative                                 around the worlds what what what one one                                 person actually did he's a developer as                                 well                                 he made a github repository showing the                                 he made a documentation basically for                                 the API so so he was just looking at the                                 traffic and seeing how the how the API                                 works and he wrote like an unofficial                                 documentation and that was the                                 documentation that I used now this                                 documentation is out on github it's                                 fully public and open so he probably                                 shouldn't have done that because you                                 know again tinder doesn't want people to                                 do this but anyway I at that time I was                                 really into this stuff so what I did is                                 I made a pull request to the developer                                 and I told him you know I actually got                                 this                                                                  documentation so he had never                                 experienced it before so I just told him                                 this happened and so we got the prayer                                 requests approved now this was one it                                 was like happy times and rainbows that                                 was before I contacted cinder yeah so ok                                 so all this stuff you know all this                                 experience all these experiences they                                 led to this you know to the creation of                                 a white hat hacker hub and although that                                 I that I that I basically I found it and                                 it was really interesting because how                                 many of you are like a familiar with                                 hacking you know like hacking stuff and                                 don't be shy about it you know let me                                 shadow rise how many raise your hands                                 yeah a couple of people yeah so you know                                 you know this concept of black hats vs.                                 white hat you know                                 so basically it's a white hat hacker hub                                 which makes basically means is that we                                 want to hack systems in order to improve                                 the security right so there's nothing                                 wrong about that we make an agreement                                 with the client or the third party that                                 we want to hack and we told them that                                 you know we're gonna hack your system                                 but under your approval in order to                                 improve your security that was the                                 concept behind the hacker hub so so it's                                 totally fine to do to do white hat                                 hacking there's no like issue with us so                                 so I started this group and gathered                                 some people smart people you know like                                 all of you in the room and then you know                                 we were thinking you know how can we                                 improve this script even better you know                                 like even you know how like how could we                                 even do also logging in right because we                                 are logging into tinder through Facebook                                 right we're using the OAuth protocol                                 with open ID how open ID Connect so so                                 basically you have this o auth URL here                                 which is this one basically by the way                                 this doesn't work anymore so obviously                                 tinder and Facebook fix this thing to                                 make it harder to do this stuff but this                                 link here when it was working if you                                 click on if you clicked on this link now                                 as you can see on the top this is a                                 fully genuine link you know it's a                                 Facebook link and it's to authorize a                                 third-party app so when you click on                                 this link if you have Facebook you get                                 directed to Facebook you login to                                 Facebook and then you get a screen up                                 with like a tinder tinder asking you to                                 authorize tinder right you've probably                                 seen this before                                 authorizing third party applications                                 right so you get the screen up and then                                 if you open up the blog I should have                                 had a screenshot here you know I'm sorry                                 about that actually it's too bad because                                 it now I can't do this anymore I need to                                 find a new link here but when you click                                 on it you get this you know this tab up                                 with tinder asking you to get access and                                 then and let's say if you're using                                 Chrome Google Chrome if you open up the                                 developer tools you go to network and                                 then you just look at the traffic and if                                 you look at it click ok on the tab                                 you'll see that you'll get a token                                 you know you'll get authorized tinder                                 it'll get a token back and that token is                                 likely access to the kingdom basically                                 you can use this token to to log into                                 tinder right from your own account                                 you don't need password anymore you                                 don't need anything of this stuff                                 anymore                                 now the token has an expiration date you                                 know how many of you are familiar with                                 JWT tokens you know yeah Jason web                                 tokens a lot of people yeah they have an                                 expiration date right so how can we                                 automate this that you know that was the                                 you know the challenge but how can we                                 get new tokens automatically basically                                 after expiration dates and basically                                 automating this whole clicking process                                 we have to click the link you know we                                 want to make it program a table you know                                 like with code and of course the group                                 the group that I gathered they're really                                 super smart so they actually found a way                                 to do it                                 so basically basically we we wrote we                                 made it so that the code would go to the                                 web browser on up a web browser and then                                 click on okay basically doing those                                 human operations through the code that's                                 what we did and it works                                 we got like we because you probably have                                 you know you know MFA multi-factor                                 authentication where you have to use                                 your phone in order to log into Facebook                                 for example right there's a double                                 security measure so we managed to type                                 bypass MFA so that you actually you get                                 it you get like an okay here and the                                 phone and click okay then it so then it                                 like it works so this this little code                                 actually bypasses everything so we did                                 that and then suddenly we had auto                                 log-in in place that was really awesome                                 then I got it out to an azure and then                                 my my Facebook account was banned of                                 course so Facebook actually locked my                                 account and they said as you can see on                                 the screen here they said that you know                                 your accounts temporary locked because                                 we see that we see that you are in two                                 places at once which is not physically                                 possible because my like the code as I                                 mentioned to you it's running an azure                                 so it's distributed so suddenly it was                                 logging in from Amsterdam and then I am                                 in Oslo and I'm using Facebook on                                 the basis and then there's a login from                                 Amsterdam so Facebook is like whoa                                 what's going on here we think someone                                 hacked your account so we're locking                                 your account and you have to change your                                 password and then I'm like you know I                                 don't want to change my password but                                 then I said what you have to change your                                 password you don't have a choice                                 this we're forcing you to do this so I                                 said okay fine so I changed my password                                 and that's unfortunately where like you                                 know everything ended because once you                                 change your password you can't really                                 automate stuff you know it's not you                                 know it's gonna be really tough but of                                 course where there is a will there is a                                 you know a chance to do so so basically                                 let's say if you are running the data                                 centers in the same country where you                                 are using the service right then you'll                                 probably bypass the security measures of                                 Facebook so if I'm running the the codes                                 and a data center in Norway for example                                 then they wouldn't detect any any issue                                 they wouldn't know right but of course                                 I'm not gonna I didn't test that out and                                 I'm not gonna test that out of course                                 again this is not allowed yeah but you                                 can it's possible okay so all right so I                                 sent an email to tinder because after                                 doing this stuff all the stuff that I                                 did and then I started you know sending                                 abstracts you know talks around the                                 world to conferences just to talk about                                 this stuff that happened to me but then                                 a lot of tech people that I know back                                 and although they told me that you know                                 you should you shouldn't do this you                                 should do the ethical thing and contact                                 hinder you shouldn't you know do you                                 know do what you did without telling                                 tinder what you did and then go talk                                 about it you know so I thought about it                                 and I said you know okay fine okay right                                 I'm gonna do that I'll contact them so I                                 contacted them and then they said you                                 know hello                                 you know like thank you for reaching out                                 and you know and then I said you have to                                 stop immediately they were pretty                                 annoyed of what I did                                 so automation is not allowed so I you                                 know no problem we stopped that but then                                 I also told them you know your service                                 went down you know it affected millions                                 of people so yeah                                 and III don't think it was me I hardly                                 hardly doubt that it was me but you know                                 what do you have any comment about that                                 and then they're like no we neither                                 confirm or deny your assumption here or                                 what happen                                 yeah but the service didn't work for                                 millions of people for two hours yeah                                 but no they're like no no no no comments                                 and also you know the funny thing with                                 tinder is that you get like a finite                                 amount of likes per day and if you pay                                 for tinder so if you pay for the service                                 you can get unlimited amount of likes                                 you can like people you know forever and                                 you can do also super likes but super                                 likes you have to pay extra you know but                                 the code that I did was like doing                                 infinite super likes infinite lights                                 with the free account because it was                                 returning                                                               service so I'm assuming that it's worked                                 you know I wouldn't two hundred is like                                 okay except or okay basically that's                                 what it means and the rest right but                                 don't they said no no no you know like                                 if you get a two hundred it doesn't mean                                 that it was actually successful now that                                 I don't understand I mean what what do                                 you think you know if you get a                                        what do you think in your head the                                 operation is successful or not or raise                                 your hands if you think if you get a few                                 right your developer you're implementing                                 something you got a                                                    think is was that okay was that a                                     successful operation raise your hand                                 okay and the rest of you do you think                                 that it isn't okay you need further                                 investigation to actually confirm the                                 operation was okay or not                                 raise your hands okay interesting yeah                                 cool cool cool you're more experienced                                 than me                                 the other you know the rest that's a                                 yeah okay so I was like okay fine fine                                 I'll stop everything you know but I                                 think this is really cool can I help you                                 no because they have like this bug                                 bounty program so I was like you know                                 can I help you can I join this bug                                 bounty program so that I can contribute                                 your                                 security work I want to do it for free                                 because you know this is fun for me                                 you know so what do you think it's okay                                 but then they never they didn't reply                                 they didn't reply at all it was like                                 silent treatment you know top level so                                 so that was pretty bad they didn't they                                 don't want my help and everything so but                                 okay fine it's you know whatever so then                                 but then you know if my friends told me                                 that because I open sourced the code                                 that I wrote so I just put it up on                                 github but that my friends some of the                                 you know some tech people back and also                                 they told me that you should you know I                                 should probably just lock the codes                                 because maybe tinder is not happy about                                 this and like that so unfortunately I                                 took down the code it's a private                                 repository too bad to that but what can                                 we do I mean it's you know we have to                                 respect we have to respect the the                                 people who make the services as we use                                 it's their service right it's their                                 business                                 we are just consumers so the code is in                                 a private repo and                                 you know I you know I don't use the code                                 I have I stopped the moment that tinder                                 said stop so I stopped at that time the                                 OAuth link that I showed you earlier                                 doesn't work anymore it was working fine                                 what I used to it and I think I believe                                 it was working for a very long time I                                 believe it was working for years                                 actually because I saw a lot of people                                 discussing this in github on github and                                 they're like you know here's the URL and                                 it was the same URL for being used for                                 years so something happened definitely                                 something happened at Facebook and                                 tinder but it's a mystery but we we have                                 yet to figure out well I'm not gonna                                 investigate this I don't know or I don't                                 want to get into trouble here                                 you know enough trouble for me that's so                                 far so all right so so how to kind of                                 conclude this experience right it was                                 really fun while it lasted you know it's                                 very very important to talk to the you                                 know to the third party in question                                 before you do any white hat hacking                                 otherwise it's not white hat so and of                                 course you know ethical hacking is you                                 know is really really fun and I think                                 that we can learn Lots if we do this I                                 believe that you know we can definitely                                 improve the security around the world                                 but you know of course a lot of people                                 say that security is really an illusion                                 right you can bypass pretty much                                 anything but having some security is                                 better than no security at all so it's                                 very very important to do that so yeah I                                 hope that you enjoyed this little talk                                 here about my experiences I hope that                                 you know you

don't                                 be shy by the way yeah thank you sweetie                                 for that very funny talk and thank you                                 for for being ethically enough for                                 through hacking to first do it                                 disclosure with the with the vendor and                                 then going public because that's just                                 the right way to do it even especially                                 if you're talking about Whitehead                                 hacking talk talk about the security                                 problems with the vendor first so they                                 have a chance to fix it before you go in                                 public so to answer your question                                 earlier I raise my hand because I just                                 had the same problem as you working with                                 an API getting two hundred okay's and                                 not having the actual thing happen so                                 yeah I'm not smarter than you I just had                                 the same problem with another API my                                 question would be have you ever found                                 out what for the tinder offers this API                                 what what's the actual use I have not                                 read the Terms of Use so can you can you                                 shine a line or light on that what can                                 you use it for yeah so what can we use                                 the app for the API for yes so you can                                 use all the functionality that you can                                 use with the official tinder app so for                                 example you can get really creative and                                 like oh create a bot for example you                                 know if you are just at home let's say                                 you get a match you can also do chatting                                 for example through the API so basically                                 all the features that you get with the                                 app you get it from the API because the                                 app uses the API right                                 so yeah so we can do pretty much                                 everything you want to do without having                                 the app but again this is not a                                 something that I that is recommended                                 here right we have
