Description: 
	Aizhamal Nurmamat Kyzy and Riona MacNamara talking about "From User to Contributor: How documentation enables vibrant open source communities".

Good engineering documentation not only drives adoption (48% of businesses say that documentation was the deciding factor in choosing to adopt an open source technology) and supports developers; it's also critical to supporting community contributors. Clear documentation of a project's processes, such as contributor guides and codes of conduct, are especially valued by under-represented groups and are vital to building inclusive communities. But in practice, 93% of OSS devs complain about the lack of good, reliable documentation, making it the #1 problem they face when working with open source software.

How can we fix this? In Q1 2019, Google's Open Source Strategy team commissioned a user research study to better understand why users do (or do not) contribute back to the project, and how documentation can help remove roadblocks to that project's adoption and usage - and encourage and enable community contributions.

In this talk, we'll cover the methodology and participant profiles of the study, and describe the three essential user personas we identified - along with their critical user journeys. And we'll also distill the research to provide concrete recommendations and best practices for creating documentation that helps your community flourish.

	                              hello and welcome to our talk was Rena                               and I we're super excited and grateful                               to be speaking at bundling buzzwords and                               we've been enjoying this event so much                               thank you for having us and yes today                               we're going to talk about documentation                               and its super power how it enables                               diverse inclusive open source                               communities so my name is eijah mal and                                I am a program manager and I work with                                open source projects related to Big Data                                Apache BIM Apache airflow maybe heard of                                that and yeah and in this communities I                                advocate for more love and more                                attention for documentation and I                                advocate for recognition of non code                                contribution and and my name is Rianna                                McNamara I am a technical writer and a                                documentation advocate working on                                Google's open source strategy team and                                I've been working in tech in                                documentation for about a quarter of a                                century and there are two things after                                all that time that I remain really                                passionate about and one is                                documentation because documentation is                                not an afterthought and it is not a                                nice-to-have                                documentation I truly believe is as                                fundamental to the discipline of                                software engineering is testing it                                empowers and accelerates great                                development and in the time that I have                                been working in open source in the very                                short time I've begun to realize that it                                is also critical for diversion and                                inclusion in technology and an open                                source and diversion inclusion is the                                other great passion of mine and since in                                the last year I've begun to see                                documentation and this cause is very                                very strongly related so these terms                                like diversity inclusion and equity we                                throw them around a lot and for a long                                time I tended to use them kind of                                interchangeably but this is a                                description I actually really like from                                Jess Mitchell where diversity is a                                number it simply represents the presence                                of difference there is a diversity of                                nationalities in this room there's a                                diversity of opinions about the ending                                of Game of Thrones                                that is just it is merely the starting                                point inclusion is much directing and                                inclusion is where we actually bring                                people in an open source is used the                                world over and our communities are in                                fact pretty diverse of users it is used                                everywhere but the community our                                community's inclusive the thing is the                                software development of all kinds                                open-source proprietary it's a deeply                                complex endeavor and it's now widely and                                known and accepted the diverse inclusive                                teens we solve problems faster they make                                more creative solutions and diverse                                inclusive companies are more profitable                                and diverse inclusive communities are                                more effective but unfortunately as we                                all know the community the contributor                                base that we have for open source at the                                moment does not reflect the user base so                                that's when we're looking at diversity                                let's have a look at some numbers and                                here's let's look at one axis of                                diversity and I just want to make the                                point that this is a short presentation                                and there isn't enough time to go into                                all the different axes of diversity I'm                                going to talk here about gender                                imbalance and of course I am ignoring                                all these other things around race                                social class the levels of ability                                orientation all the rest nevermind the                                intersections of these things but for                                now we're going to talk about gender                                balance and let's assume that in the                                general population people identifying as                                male and female are about equal while                                also acknowledging that it doesn't add                                up to hundred percent right so that's                                that's our general population let's now                                look at the world of professional                                programmers and it depends the figures                                vary depending on how you define a                                programmer right but this one figure it                                goes somewhere between twenty one twenty                                seven percent so the numbers the                                 diversity is not looking so good there                                 let's look at open source I'm going to                                 help you out there that's three percent                                 in the github survey in                                             respondents ninety-five percent were                                 male three percent were women and one                                 percent for non-binary and obviously                                 this is representing a problem for open                                 source because when our compete                                 munities are not inclusive when women                                 and underrepresented minorities feel                                 uncomfortable and unwelcome everybody                                 suffers our communities and projects                                 miss out on the skills creativity and                                 talent of a huge number of our users and                                 it's bad for our projects it's bad for                                 our users and when we consider that we                                 are now in a world where increasingly a                                 track record of contributions to                                 open-source is seen as a prerequisite                                 for getting a job in proprietary                                 software this imbalance and open source                                 has the potential to make the gender                                 imbalance even worse at Google we wanted                                 to understand more about this so we                                 commissioned a study and we wanted to                                 better understand how why and how people                                 contribute or do not contribute to open                                 source projects and here I'm going to                                 hand you off to a jamel who's going to                                 tell you more about the study the                                 process that we took and the findings of                                 the study Thank You Reena so we started                                 the process by talking to different                                 people at Google that are involved with                                 open source we talked to project                                 maintainers who are also like software                                 engineers technical writers product                                 managers program managers and we were                                 looking to understand what kind of                                 challenges they had trying to bring more                                 users and contributors to their project                                 and through these conversations we also                                 wanted to set our expectations define                                 our research goals and also talk about                                 what would be the desired outcome from                                 the research so we can benefit a lot of                                 open source projects and so the goal was                                 to understand who are our users that are                                 using our software and how do they go                                 from being just the user to a community                                 member in contributor and in their                                 transition from user to contributor what                                 information needs they have like what                                 questions they ask and we were hoping to                                 find answers to these questions and once                                 we found we wanted to document                                 everything and document the best                                 practice                                 so how to foster open source                                 contributions and we interviewed                                    candidates from various backgrounds and                                 all of them recent open source software                                 users and we discussed their experience                                 with evaluating open source technologies                                 and we especially asked them about the                                 feelings and experience around                                 contributing to open source and if they                                 weren't contributing we wanted to know                                 why what are the barriers and once these                                 interviews were completed we collected                                 all the date all this data and we                                 grouped them and we did the thematic                                 analysis to uncover common patterns and                                 themes and which eventually helped us                                 craft the user archetypes and their                                 journey Maps so in our study we actually                                 identified five archetypes here you can                                 see only four because and the other                                 archetype is lurkers lurkers they don't                                 interact with the project and we don't                                 know anything about them so we ignore                                 them for now and we focus on this fork                                 or leader convinced competent and                                 curious archetypes and yeah let's start                                 with Rory Rory she's a leader in open                                 source she she has like she is an active                                 a member of open-source community she                                 she collaborates with other leaders she                                 provides a lot of mentorship she                                 contributes code and documentation and                                 she is very well supported by her                                 employer and but she loves open-source                                 and she wants more people to use open                                 source and and she doesn't have enough                                 time to convince other teams and                                 business units of value of using and                                 contributing factor open source and she                                 needs tools to scale and maintain and                                 grow her open source projects                                 then there's Avery Avery she's she knows                                 a fellow of contributing she can                                 contribute dogs she can contribute code                                 and she is very familiar with the                                 projects you could bring a lot of like a                                 lot of value to the project but she's                                 not doing it yet because her employer                                 doesn't support her her employer is                                 skeptical about open source he like he                                 doesn't know afoul of contributing to                                 open source and Avery she has to do it                                 on her free time and it's not very easy                                 yesterday in her speech in Isabel she                                 she was talking about convincing your                                 manager of value of contributing to open                                 source and that's exactly what Avery                                 needs she needs help convincing her                                 manager that open source is good to use                                 and open sources and people needs to                                 keep contributing to others and then                                 there is Taylor Taylor he is software                                 engineer and he's somewhat familiar with                                 the project he sometimes engaged with                                 the project and he contributes code                                 mostly bug fixes and he thinks that                                 contributing code is the only way of                                 contribution to open source he has a lot                                 of expertise and that he could bring to                                 the project but he's not confident                                 whether his time is spending in the                                 right way whether it's worth his time                                 whether his contributions are going to                                 be recognized and rewarded and tailored                                 needs to be solved on the value of                                 contribution like he needs to be                                 convinced that he can become a valuable                                 member of the community and by                                 continuing to contribute not only code                                 but documentation right so yesterday                                 grace and Isabel they also talked about                                 how we need to recognize and reward                                 people like Taylor to keep them                                 motivated involved and keep them active                                 in open-source and that's exactly what                                 Taylor needs and finally meet Park                                 her partner she's our heroine and she's                                 she's very curious about open source and                                 she would like to use one for her void                                 Co work but she faces a lot of barriers                                 first she's unfamiliar with open source                                 in general she doesn't know what the                                 process is what like licenses about and                                 she doesn't know ethics and how people                                 interact and she might not even be                                 familiar with tools and platforms like                                 github and and she doesn't know whether                                 her employer will be happy if she starts                                 using it right and Parker loves the idea                                 of open source however and she would                                 love to contribute back someday but                                 she's because she's not engineering she                                 doesn't know whether she can bring                                 anything valuable to the project so she                                 might be also nervous because she might                                 not speak English as a first language so                                 she might not be able to understand very                                 like advanced documentation and and she                                 might even experience like harassment in                                 the web so it's very like scary to get                                 involved and Parker she needs all the                                 support that you can give her so she can                                 get started like in you need to show her                                 like how it's done like how to file your                                 first PR how to like just set the                                 expectation okay it takes like a couple                                 days to get your what is it PR say prove                                 it or a couple months or whatever right                                 and I assume that many people in the                                 room you like might be like Rory like                                 leader in open source or a very                                 experienced contributor like Avery but I                                 really want to talk about Parker today                                 because she's where we start in the                                 beginning like I was Parker like a                                 couple months ago right and when I just                                 started contributing and I want us to                                 see how she becomes                                 user of open source and how she grows                                 into contributor in the open source or                                 maybe she doesn't grow into contributor                                 let's find out                                 so how does Parker pick a project how                                 she becomes a user right there are many                                 available options libraries and how does                                 she choose the right one she starts by                                 looking into available options and once                                 she finds one software the project that                                 looks promising she does a quick                                 assessment for free will it will it work                                 with my team with my environment like                                 will I be able to understand this and                                 she wants to be able to sift out the                                 project projects that she can't work                                 with like quickly like she doesn't want                                 to spend like one man studying project                                 and not be able to use that then and if                                 the project passes her sniff test she                                 needs to understand if the project is                                 healthy and well maintained so she does                                 it by looking at statistic and github by                                 how many stars downloads how often the                                 releases are how like how recent the                                 commits are and she also like overviews                                 documentation at this date quickly                                 because she wants to make sure that they                                 exist so she can rely on them later and                                 only once she is sure that the project                                 is healthy and active only after that                                 she starts building into code itself and                                 she needs to be able to create a map of                                 the technology and understand whether                                 it's a good fit for her use case and she                                 also wants to she wants help getting up                                 and running very quickly by doing the                                 Quick Start and tutorials and all of the                                 people that we spoke to they mentioned                                 that documentation was so critical at                                 this face and well maintained and                                 structured accessible available                                 documentation was a strong signal that                                 the project is healthy and of course                                 before adopting any open source                                 technology people like Parker she wants                                 to make sure that there will be no like                                 legal complications like of using free                                 software right she wants to know whether                                 there's any documentation available that                                 explains like legal policies and whether                                 she can pass them on to her legal team                                 for assessment and Isabelle also                                 mentioned that like everyone before                                 adopting a new technology they asked                                 these questions and it's very important                                 and you need to make sure that you have                                 it so one spark is able to answer all of                                 those questions she's ready to adopt the                                 technology she starts using it and she's                                 excited about technology because it's                                 free it's fun it helps her to her word                                 and as she keeps using software as it                                 always happens she eventually runs into                                 a bug or some problem right and and she                                 starts digging into documentation and                                 she starts reaching out people in social                                 channels to to find the solution and                                 after hard work a lot of hours spent on                                 the research she she finally finds a                                 solution and she is excited about it she                                 she knows she has an idea and she knows                                 how to fix it right and at this stage                                 Parker is adapting the project making it                                 better because she is like making a fix                                 for the bug right and and she's happy                                 about it because she knows her fix is                                 good and it would benefit everyone in                                 the community it would save a lot of                                 trouble and time for many others that                                 will use the same software and she                                 really wants to contribute back but she                                 has never created any                                 you are or submitted to fix so it's a                                 big career for her and let's imagine                                 even like she comes and she wants to                                 contribute back she talks to her boss                                 and her boss is not supportive and she                                 says like oh we don't pay you for your                                 open source contributions don't spend                                 time on it and it's and it's very hard                                 and like she started thinking about all                                 of this and she starts thinking about                                 like whether her fix is good enough                                 whether it's valuable whether people are                                 going to call Parker that she's not good                                 enough that she's asking stupid                                 questions so so it's very daunting it's                                 very scary and at this stage it becomes                                 very easy for Parker not to share rather                                 than share her fix and because the act                                 of contribution contributing to open                                 source itself is very vulnerable and                                 exposes you in front of all these people                                 right and she doesn't have bandwidth to                                 deal with all of this and it's a lot of                                 pressure and it's stressful and then                                 let's imagine she decides not to                                 contribute back and it's really really                                 sad story because it happens all the                                 time and if she if Parker decides not to                                 contribute that we all lose right Parker                                 loses the opportunity to become like                                 valuable member of the community the                                 project loses because it would benefit                                 greatly from her fix and also her                                 employer loses because they don't have                                 this proof that they can show to their                                 customers and LaHaye we are very active                                 in open source communities as Isabel was                                 mentioning yesterday so how can we help                                 Parker like how we can ensure that she                                 doesn't feel this way and actually makes                                 her way to her first contribution and do                                 you have an ideas Reena I have some                                 ideas okay thank you as you might well                                 let's rewind this a little bit so how                                 might the story have turned out better                                 what if Parker had been able to access                                 the information she needed to every step                                 of her journey because let's remember                                 the Parker is brand-new to open source                                 she's not an engineer she doesn't have a                                 lot of support internally or externally                                 maybe English isn't her first language                                 and she may not be uncomfortable in                                 online communities these are all                                 challenges that she faces but let's also                                 acknowledge that she is smart as a whip                                 she has a ton to contribute and she has                                 unique perspectives that are a value of                                 that so how might that turn out what                                 might be get if she actually felt                                 supported at every stage of the journey                                 is that the case it's actually not                                 really the case today far too much so in                                 the next few slides I want to talk a                                 little bit about why documentation is so                                 critical in this journey what                                 documentation you need is every stage of                                 the journey and touch a little bit about                                 how you can get that documentation this                                 is a really sad story according to the                                 open source survey incomplete or                                 outdated information is a pervasive                                 problem observed by                                            population and this is horrifying                                 because open source any kind of software                                 is such a deeply complex and highly                                 collaborative endeavor documentation is                                 a critical part of it yet even now it's                                 super common to hear people say the                                 documentation is not that necessary it's                                 still                                                                 say things like just read the code you                                 don't need documentation this is                                 actually a real-life query that I saw in                                 kora                                 I redacted the name because I'm a good                                 person but they it's it's along with the                                 same query some other answers were read                                 the code commit by commit then you can                                 learn to understand it you know who has                                 the time for that and north alot of                                 people specifically do not have the time                                 for that this is one example the UN                                 study shows that women the world over do                                                                                                          that men do women do that represents                                 hours and hours of day of unpaid work                                 the men on average and that means that                                 we need to acknowledge the free time to                                 open contribute and use open sources of                                 privilege people like Parker many people                                 just do not have the time to go and                                 read the code commit by commit we need                                 documentation that explains the project                                 and the code and clearly outlines the                                 processes of the community so people                                 without this leisure time and employer                                 support to investigate lack of                                 documentation is an incredibly effective                                 barrier to current contribution another                                 one is that we may think of ourselves as                                 a friendly community but the truth is                                 that not everybody experiences the                                 Internet in the same way and not                                 everybody feels safe reaching out for                                 example women are far more likely to                                 encounter language or content that makes                                 them feel unwelcome as well as                                 stereotypical behavior and even                                 harassment on the web and unsurprisingly                                 then women and underrepresented                                 minorities are far less likely to reach                                 out to strangers and ask for help in                                 forums or in other things so in this                                 circumstance lack of documentation is an                                 incredibly effective barrier to                                 contribution here's another one nearly                                                                                                         and reads English less than very well                                 again this adds complexity to how you                                 find information and makes you less                                 confident when you're reaching out to                                 people when people in this case when                                 English is the de facto language of                                 software development and we don't have                                 clear easily readable documentation                                 that's enough an effective barrier to                                 contribution and in other areas that not                                 everybody comes into open source the                                 same level of expertise at the same                                 level of background is something for                                 Parker we see as a data analyst not an                                 engineer if we don't have documentation                                 that accommodates for every level of                                 expertise and provides an on-ramp for                                 everybody who might use our software                                 that is an incredibly effective barrier                                 to participation and contribution the                                 fact is as I de Mille said                                 contributing an even using open-source                                 software requires ourselves to be                                 incredibly vulnerable and open ourselves                                 up to criticism from not even like in                                 the workplace where we know people and                                 they are paid to help us perform an                                 anonymous people the world over it is an                                 incredibly terrifying thing and this was                                 echoed by everybody in our study not                                 even not just the Parkers and the                                 beginners                                 everybody even experienced people                                 experience the self-doubt when they were                                 putting out their PRS the refer they                                 were afraid to ask questions and they                                 were afraid because they might sound                                 stupid and they were afraid to answer                                 questions because they might their                                 answers might get torn apart so how can                                 we then let's talk about the                                 documentation how can we empower people                                 to take this leap because it's                                 incredibly rewarding what is the                                 information that we can provide clear                                 accessible information available to all                                 that describes the project it's cold the                                 open source world and the processes and                                 norms of our communities so what I want                                 to do is just look at Parker's journey                                 and just talk about the specific                                 documentation needs that she has at                                 every stage so when she's investigating                                 a project she needs to know straight                                 upfront things that will allow her to                                 eliminate a project because it's not a                                 fit for her team make sure that really                                 up front on your documentation you have                                 very discoverable things that outlines                                 the basics platform languages other                                 compatibility but also things like use                                 cases these are really important things                                 not only for Parker will dissolve her                                 problem but it allows her to take it to                                 her manager and her boss and say this is                                 something our business should be                                 investing in they also want to know can                                 they get started quickly how hard is it                                 going to be to ramp up clear getting                                 started guides and tutorials are going                                 to be really important here and at this                                 stage they're going to be looking at the                                 documentation itself this QuickStart                                 information but they're also really                                 going to be looking at the presence even                                 if they don't dig into the documentation                                 the presence of it is such a strong                                 proxy that this is going to be well                                 supported on your journey and Isabel and                                 touched on this very strongly and                                 actually talked about this about people                                 you can share their use cases because if                                 you're not supported you need I think                                 it's like the majority of people in the                                 github survey said that they their work                                 employers had very unclear policies and                                 understandings around using and                                 contributing to open source so the more                                 resources that can provide especially                                 use cases and then documentation about                                 the requirement and then she also needs                                 to                                 learn about getting started with github                                 you don't need to document get up but                                 you need to make sure that there are                                 clear pointers to that and make sure                                 that her baby steps are well documented                                 so this is an example of the kind of                                 things they look at people specific                                 documentation sets that our respondents                                 identified as being particularly helpful                                 to them and that were decision-making                                 and they explicitly call that navigation                                 like this is a really strong quality for                                 it so when she gets into it this is                                 where the standard typical engineering                                 documentation comes in this is where                                 things like api references overviews                                 how-to guides tutorials troubleshooting                                 standard core engineering documentation                                 becomes very important but it's very                                 important that this exists but it also                                 supports all levels of expertise we kind                                 of presuppose too much knowledge around                                 that and we also need to make sure that                                 they know where to find other sources of                                 help people are less happy even asking                                 questions but there are little happier                                 reading answers to other people's                                 questions and again at this stage                                 navigation and organization is very                                 important and at this stage when she's                                 digging in it becomes really critical                                 that your docs set is searchable because                                 at this stage in the early stage they're                                 looking to make a decision but when                                 they're implementing they need to go                                 back and find information over and over                                 again they know what they're looking for                                 now and they need to be able to find us                                 so search becomes really important in                                 this stage so once she has this and she                                 is using it and she gets this trigger                                 she makes the fix it's very very                                 important the most important factor is                                 psychological safety we need a friendly                                 and well moderated community and we can                                 help by this by providing written                                 guidelines accessible both to the                                 maintainer --zz and the community but                                 also to new people that describe how                                 best to moderate and review PRS had to                                 do it in a way that is safe and                                 welcoming and that is really important                                 especially remembering that Parker may                                 not have had positive experiences on                                 Internet in the past another area is                                 that Parker may experiences a lot of                                 self-doubt she's not sure how she can                                 contribute it's a clear welcoming                                 documentation that really makes her feel                                 welcome acknowledges that she brings                                 perspectives and provides a lot of                                 options to contribute you may not be an                                 engineer but as we say there's a lot of                                 Chris's talk yesterday talked about this                                 a lot this user management there's                                 documentation obviously but there's also                                 organizing meetups program management                                 triage all sorts of ways that people can                                 effectively do it and one thing that's                                 worth bearing in mind here is that a lot                                 of women and underrepresented minorities                                 may not feel comfortable putting                                 themselves forward if you notice a new                                 user in the community and they're doing                                 their logging issues they found an issue                                 with the docks                                 it's worth considering reaching out to                                 them and suggesting and saying you made                                 a really good point here and you bring                                 this fresh perspective you're in a                                 position to identify gaps in the                                 documentation which are seasoned users                                 are not we would welcome please                                 acknowledge and contribute to your                                 documentation and once people do that                                 it's really really important that we                                 recognize and celebrate non-code                                 contributions obviously including but                                 not limited but obviously including                                 documentation and there's so many ways                                 of doing that and one thing is like put                                 documentation updates in your release                                 notes just like you put feature and code                                 updates go and give public tanks that                                 acknowledges people in the mailing lists                                 this is a good thing to do and an                                 encouraging thing to do but it can also                                 help people overcome barriers with their                                 employers because they can take this and                                 demonstrate the value of what they are                                 bringing to the community there's a lot                                 of other ways and there's I just                                 discovered this get a project recognize                                 all contributors which is an awesome way                                 of putting people's faces it pulls the                                 names and things and puts it right into                                 your documentation where everybody can                                 see it and it also supports things like                                 non code contributions and I'll tweet                                 out the link to that later on                                 so when Parker contributes to this                                 everybody wins she gets to grow and to                                 feel good and to be part of a community                                 obviously the project's users all get                                 the benefits of her fix the community is                                 stronger and even her employer benefits                                 it's more efficient if her fixes                                 integrated upstream then when you                                 upgrade there's one less thing to worry                                 about and it's also something like a PR                                 thing that her employer can do so it's                                 really important so let's recap some of                                 the key messages that we have here lack                                 of documentation is a highly effective                                 barrier to adoption and contribution and                                 in a world where communities are vital                                 to project health code quality and                                 adoption we need this kind of                                 documentation it slack is particularly                                 harmful to underrepresented groups                                 including people who have limited time                                 speak English who the lower level of                                 expertise or feels unsafe and online                                 communities psychological safety is                                 paramount                                 open-source requires us to be vulnerable                                 we can make people feel safe and                                 welcomed in the community with good                                 documentation a friendly and well                                 moderated community and active                                 contributions that provide a model for                                 new contributors the kind to build                                 psychological safety and empower                                 contributions we need to provide                                 documentation that clearly describes the                                 project its code and the community and                                 this is what's Bill's safety and                                 confidence just as in the Apache Way                                 decision making is made in the open                                 documentation is how we get tribal                                 knowledge out of the heads of people and                                 put it in the hands of where it is                                 accessible to everybody doc sir didn't                                 happen it doesn't exist and we need to                                 seek out support and recognize                                 documentation contributions we need to                                 make it as easy as possible to be                                 contribute we need to reach out to                                 people provide clear lines and we need                                 to be responsive and kind it sounds like                                 table stakes than everybody in this room                                 I'm just                                 and that so at the beginning of this                                 talk we talked about diversity inclusion                                 and we haven't yet really touched on                                 equity the open source world is already                                 diverse it has used the world over by                                 all sorts of Engineers when we create                                 documentation that enables everybody to                                 contribute to our project we make those                                 communities more inclusive but                                 documentation has the power to do an                                 awful lot more we talk about this world                                 now where a track record of open-source                                 contribution can be a pathway to                                 employment and that means that is a                                 pathway to economic advancement think                                 about people some people have gone to                                 universities gotten CS degrees some                                 people are going through the bootcamp                                 route they're doing this as their chance                                 for a new role and to enter this field                                 documentation could be a really powerful                                 tool for equity and inclusion tribal                                 knowledge concentrates power in the                                 hands of the privileged view its                                 inefficient which is why we do                                 everything on the list but it's also                                 harmful and we know this at a really                                 intuitive level all of us grew up with                                 fairy stories were one of the myths is                                 the young hero or heroine who needs to                                 find the book of knowledge because the                                 universal access to knowledge threatens                                 the dominant order and there is a reason                                 for example that age was a crime to                                 teach enslaved people to read and                                 everyone here in this room and I feel                                 this very strongly about myself we all                                 just by being in this room are                                 experiencing a really strong level of                                 privilege right we all have different                                 levels of privilege right but to be here                                 at this conference for those of us who                                 were not German we were all able to get                                 a visa and enter this country we all                                 understand English enough to have these                                 conversations and do this our employers                                 probably paid for us to be here but in                                 any way we're economically able to be                                 here for people with kids we have                                 somebody to watch those kids and just by                                 being here everyone here and I miss my                                 first buzz words and I'm feeling this                                 really strongly we are building networks                                 and connections we're building social                                 capital that will grow our careers and                                 our economic status and after this                                 comfort conference we're going to feel                                 so much more comfortable reaching out to                                 people that we met here today and                                 there's nothing wrong with having that                                 privilege but in a world for our                                 participation and open source can be a                                 path to economic advancement to promote                                 not just diversity and inclusion but                                 also equity we can use that privilege if                                 we ensure that we document our community                                 norms and practices and our projects                                 encodes the knowledge needed to navigate                                 our communities is available to                                 everybody we promote equity if we do                                 what we can to make sure that that                                 knowledge is accessible to everyone                                 regardless of language or ability or                                 social capital                                 we promote equity and if we give people                                 the knowledge they need to participate                                 in this amazing industry to take                                 advantage of the economic advancement it                                 offers we promote equity and if we seek                                 out contributions from underrepresented                                 groups and give them opportunities we                                 promote equity knowledge is power and                                 documentation is how we make that power                                 available to everyone thank you very                                 much for having us here it has been a                                 privilege thank you                                 [Applause]                                 all right so we saw from this talk and                                 from the keynotes as well that there are                                 a lot of ways to contribute to open                                 source project other than donating and                                 contributing source code that's good to                                 to know and I think we have time for one                                 question yes I will pass around the mic                                 thank you great talk you mentioned                                 briefly something that I think is an                                 incredible asset that a new contributor                                 has to a project and I wish it had a                                 name because I think all of us seasoned                                 people that have API blindness we                                 totally don't understand the perspective                                 of a new contributor I've heard it                                 called a very unique tool that is very                                 sharp but quickly dulls I think if we                                 could identify that and name this                                 amazing quality that new contributors                                 bring to a project that would be an                                 amazing draw because these people bring                                 something incredibly special that we all                                 have lost I agree like if what I think                                 you're describing is an obliviousness                                 two blind spots we have blind spots new                                 people do not and that's incredibly                                 special yeah so we should be seeking out                                 these people that have spots exactly                                 especially when you think about things                                 like we take certain skill levels for                                 granted right so we don't document                                 things for beginners yes I would love to                                 have a conversation about how to what we                                 should call that and have a name for it                                 we've heard a name and I lost the name                                 and I have my own tremendous API                                 blindness but if we could give it a name                                 that would spread I think that would                                 just be an incredible draw to help us                                 grow our communities and I don't have                                 the name yet - is there a task that                                 that's just a good conversation over                                 coffee it's it's what a newcomer has                                 that's the opposite of API blindness API                                 blindness is when you're so familiar                                 with your source code and your processes                                 and github that you don't even                                 understand what a new person feels when                                 they try to join your project all of the                                 barriers that they hit                                 because you don't see those barriers                                 anymore you're so comfortable with your                                 community in your processes so newcomer                                 because they with that they can tell you                                 what are the barriers to the other                                 newcomers that are trying to join your                                 project and if we fix those the process                                 just accelerates it becomes an awesome                                 flywheel so we need a name for it that                                 we all can agree on and yeah                                 so I was suggesting that we refer to                                 that as user empathy especially new user                                 empathy trying to understand precisely                                 those two sticky points and we're a bit                                 late folks get kind of I hold and then                                 dropped from the funnel so how do we                                 prevent that attrition from the journey                                 we can start the thread and suggest I                                 think that's a very interesting                                 conversation but let's stick to the                                 schedule maybe you can take this                                 discussion offline with the speakers and                                 so let's thank the speakers again thank                                 you very much Rina Angela                                 [Applause]
