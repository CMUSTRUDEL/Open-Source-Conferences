Description: 
	Margaux Wagner and Lucian Precup talking about "Integrate your Search Engine with a Voice Assistant".

The User Experience on a mobile phone is different of that of a tablet and still different of that of a computer screen. You have to adapt your graphical interface, the information displayed but also the calls to your services.

When the “User Interface” is a “voice”, the User Experience and the services your application provides need to adjust.

In this presentation we will adapt, step by step, an Enterprise Search Engine to Google Assistant and, more generally, to a Virtual Voice Assistant. The challenge will be to find the one and only meaningful result with a minimum of round trips while taking into account all the constraints of this type of User Interaction (among which also: "being funny with the answers").

                         van song alexei so yeah here we go so                                let's back first before she goes to                                search to voice search by first - what                                we know already so here is a let's call                                a classical search engine ok so here is                                on a large screen what we call large                                screen is on a laptop for example so                                here you can see you have a lot of                                information display so I was can see you                                have all your baskets and all your                                profile for example here also of course                                you have all the result so you can see                                you have like                                                           display here we see like we can have                                like a marketing shortcuts like to push                                some content and here on the left we can                                see we have facets in order to narrow                                the the results in order to help the                                customer to go directly to what you                                really wants to so the screen displays                                only to fast is there but you notice                                that there is a scrollbar so you have                                plenty of space there actually like                                six or seven fastest there and ten or                                twelve results on the first page so                                here's another example so here you have                                the what we call auto completion so you                                just have to type like three of two or                                three letters and the search and I will                                give you some suggestions products                                objection so you notice that the input                                is not verbose you just typed three                                letters and the engine answered yeah the                                goal here is really to show you all the                                information that we can provide you to                                the users here's another example again                                does nobody knows how to write that what                                it so they're search and I will give you                                like you suggest you another product in                                ordered once again to help the customer                                the user to find the product he wants so                                the goal is really to show like all the                                information that we can display on a                                classical search engine the reason I                                have to who speaks German and who speaks                                French is because as you notice we have                                some examples here that are taken from                                some search engines that we build and                                they are mostly in French but I think                                you can follow so here's another example                                this is internal search uncheck that we                                develop at editing and you can also have                                all the suggestions like did you mean so                                for example when you do their customer                                didn't write like did a misspelled in in                                the search for the sorting here in this                                example you can even display the result                                by map because for these clients like                                you wanted to have all the document                                regarding the the different country here                                you have the imagination with all the                                page like it can have a lot of results                                and here the same like oh the facet like                                you can see we can have a lot of facets                                once again to help the customer and the                                users to get to the to the product to to                                what he's looking for                                so as you can notice there's plenty of                                space so you can as yeah in just one                                call to the search engine you can                                display plenty of things it's not like a                                narrow plane dashboard but there's                                plenty of space now let's move on and                                see how what happens when we are                                reducing the string the screen size so                                 now is on a mobile device so as you can                                 see we still have a lot of information                                 but search engine had to                                 tapped and try to display the result in                                 another way for example here we don't                                 have the the facet display by default so                                 the user has to click on it you see all                                 of them and you see like many men the                                 main facet like they will hide a little                                 bit of your of your screen so this is                                 another way to display information but                                 still we have placed four facets even if                                 not on the first screen so same here                                 like we took exactly the same example                                 that before on the laptop but on a                                 mobile device and you can see you still                                 have the information but display in                                 another way so the search engine started                                 to adapt a little bit but you know it's                                 use your small adaptation                                 okay the last example with the same with                                 the same search on time than before so                                 now we can have like only one result                                 before we have like three or four the                                 same for the facet and the filter and                                 yeah all the information again okay so                                 now let's move on to the real subject so                                 the issues and challenge with the voice                                 search so first of all like we saw we                                 have the first challenge is a lack of                                 space nack we don't have any more the                                 device the visual device will need to                                 adapt regarding the the display                                 information large amount of results so                                 you just so before all the pagination or                                 the result that you can have here with                                 the voice search we will not be able to                                 list all the result that the certain I                                 will get so we really need to narrow the                                 request to know exactly what the user is                                 looking for how to clarify like we saw                                 before with again does like the search                                 on try suggest something to the to the                                 user with the voice search we will need                                 to really to clarify and to have the                                 exact request once again in order to                                 give the good result the stop words on                                 noise in the queries so users today I                                 are more for bones yeah sorry so the                                 queries are more verbose yeah exactly                                 and when you use a classic search on try                                 you are more used to have like a                                 keywords but when you go to a voice                                 search we are more                                 willing to talk like a conversation so                                 you will say I would like something                                 instead of to put only the keywords so                                 this is another challenge that will have                                 to answer it so if you if you go from                                 auto-completion where you just typed                                 three letters right and you come to                                 voice search actually the query will be                                 much larger and the last one the field                                 to express other search keywords we will                                 go deep into this subject but for                                 example when you have organic organic                                 tomato for example organic can be taken                                 as a filter and the voice search will                                 need to focus on what is a keyword and                                 what can be a filter okay so let's see                                 how we we tackle these challenges how we                                 we deal with them so before we start                                 let's see what classical search engine                                 so a search engine that displays                                 something that you just saw on large                                 screen on an on mobile so usually no                                 matter what search engine it is it needs                                 an input and it's usually a text filters                                 and some sorting information and as an                                 output the search engine can give of                                 course results and it can give like the                                 first page of results the first page                                 like of the first                                                       whatever it can also give suggestions                                 like did you mean something else by your                                 query by your request                                 it can give facets and not just one it                                 can give several facets and it can also                                 give like additional information like                                 something like the admin of the search                                 engine has pushed on in the results we                                 can call the marketing marketing                                 shortcuts so all these things can be                                 displayed on a screen this is our                                 classical search engine works so now the                                 challenge will be like to move for a                                 classical search on Jai to a search                                 search for Sanjay so the first step                                 would be like translating the voice into                                 text and then the second step will be                                 like finding out what's the intent of                                 the user because you can talk to a                                 search engine but you can have like                                 several service                                 is like a service that looks for                                 locations for store locations and a                                 service like that looks like for product                                 products so the first the first step                                 whether the second step is to figure out                                 the intent so for the speech-to-text                                 part you actually have very powerful                                 tools provided by Google Amazon and all                                 the big ones if however you decide to go                                 by yourself it's possible but it will be                                 hard we actually tried to build a                                 prototype at Dillion and yeah it works                                 but it's like like it's really hard we                                 yeah so the voice the sound waves are                                 translated into like phonemes and then                                 the foam phonemes are classified like                                 categorized the most relevant ones and                                 then the other ones and then we are                                 searching these phonemes into a                                 dictionary so the quality of your                                 speech-to-text engine is kind of related                                 to the quality of your dictionary for                                 example you might have said fan and                                 gloves and the search and order the                                 speech-to-text engine finds phone and                                 globes because your dictionary doesn't                                 have these two words so the output of                                 the dictionary is called hypothesis                                 hypothesis and you have like not just                                 one you have like probabilities and                                 stuff like that the second part which is                                 like what's the intent of the user am i                                 searching am i using the shop search                                 service or the product search service                                 it's actually already provided out of                                 the box with all the voice assistants                                 out there so being Google or Amazon so                                 they are all using the same pattern so                                 the first one is the intent the second                                 one is you Terrence's so you Torrance's                                 are like templates so templates of                                 phrases that define the intent for                                 example if you say I am looking for                                 something                                 then the engine will say okay you want                                 to call the product search service if                                 you say where is something then the                                 voice assistant will say ok you will                                 want you will call the search location                                 service and the last the last point here                                 the lot the last definition here is slot                                 Amazon cause it entities is what's the                                 parameters that you provide to the to                                 the service so it's like methods and                                 parameters in this example Tomatoes is                                 the parameters I am looking for tomatoes                                 and the the intent is the product search                                 very quickly on this imagine that you                                 want to integrate your search engine                                 yeah being yeah Google or something else                                 in this example I took a search engine                                 that we built which is called a                                      goes like this or the device like Google                                 home for example course the assistant                                 the voice assistant then it goes so this                                 one is taken from Google so this one is                                 yeah uses Google terms and technology we                                 we go through dialogue fro and then you                                 need a piece of software the green one a                                 to proxy there that will actually adapt                                 the calls to your search engine search                                 engine so you can just take any search                                 engine and plug it in but as you will                                 see you have to also adapt if you want                                 to something relevant if you want to                                 have something relevant ok so just to                                 conclude this part so first of all you                                 will have the user speaking with his                                 voice the voice will be transformed to                                 text with the functionality                                 speech-to-text sorry and then you will                                 have what just losing lucien talk about                                 our intent utterance and slot to                                 recognize what which which service to                                 call and everything and then this is                                 where you can plug we can connect your                                 search engine so now the first challenge                                 so like a talk before                                 laço space to display information so                                 let's go for this one ok                                 yes there are two possibilities here for                                 for when you when you're talking to a                                 search engine you you have sometimes you                                 can have some display a smaller one a                                 small display but you you can have it if                                 you look at a car you have you have like                                 you can talk to the car but the car can                                 also display things on a screen and also                                 the the assistants that are found in                                 your in your phone they can talk to you                                 but they can also display something okay                                 so it helps as you will see and yeah the                                 second the second way of interacting                                 with a search engine is like voice only                                 and there it's much more difficult you                                 actually don't have any space to display                                 anything you just talk to the user so                                 second wall second one large amount of                                 results how to narrow the request so                                 there's there's a quick win solution                                 here so actually the search engine will                                 have to respond to the user with a                                 question because you cannot respond with                                 results facets suggestions and other                                 informations other information so you                                 will have to respond with a question so                                 why not why not taking filters you say                                 okay let's pick a filter and then ask                                 the user which brand do you like what                                 flavor for the ice cream but the issue                                 there is that you can have many facets                                 and we added the challenge is which                                 facet to choose for the first question                                 for the second question there's also a                                 pre-requisite there is that your search                                 engine has to have facets and the facet                                 that it has must be relevant it can be                                 not the case so if we go further this is                                 the example of a search engine that                                 doesn't have facets so actually this is                                 an example taken from Wikipedia and we                                 are using hero a technology called                                 carrot carrot search there is a plugin                                 for elastic search for solar so you can                                 plug it it to                                 you have to any search engine so when                                 you search for orange oranges                                 actually this is ambiguous and Wikipedia                                 doesn't help facets it cannot say oh                                 okay what kind of voyages so you could                                 use what we call clustering so this is                                 like carrot search does that for us and                                 you could respond to the user with a                                 question that is do you mean the color                                 do you mean the city in California do                                 you mean                                 the company do you mean the fruit so                                 yeah this is the disambiguation part so                                 the first one will be the stop word on                                 nose in the query so you will see how to                                 get rid of this yeah so this is when you                                 get off road what what does what does                                 that mean                                 if you are using a voice assistant you                                 will notice that sometimes the voice                                 assistant says I don't understand what                                 you just asked me and then you say well                                 I'm just asking you the same thing as                                 usually but I'm just using some other                                 words why can't you adapt so thing is                                 that when you define uterine seas within                                 your voice assistant actually you have                                 to be precise you you have to to say                                 your uterus is our I am looking for I am                                 searching for please give me no no so                                 you have to define all these way of                                 interacting with with the search engine                                 but this is like limited and there's a                                 reason for why these voice assistance                                 function like that why they work like                                 that is because we have a history there                                 we have                                                                 are made for text so the voice                                 assistance tries to narrow your search                                 to a keyword but if you go off-road for                                 example yeah you ask a question that the                                 the search engine and the voice                                 assistant has never seen for example                                 this one I'm searching for some a                                 win-win our conference is on an elastic                                 search or yeah what's the best way to                                 plug this                                 cable it's like real word and if the                                 admin of the voice assistant hasn't                                 thought about this way of asking the                                 search engine yeah you cannot respond so                                 what how can we tackle that                                 so actually yeah we have a demo on this                                 but we'll go faster because we have                                 another demo in the end with a real                                 voice assistant in order to remove the                                 noise in the query there's a notion of                                 stop words now you might say well stop                                 words are yeah no longer fashioned                                 anymore because you can use a common                                 terms query those who work with                                 elasticsearch know what I mean actually                                 will common term scurry will not help                                 and you will understand why if I take                                 this this query I am looking for                                 chocolate please could you help me with                                 that the one and single interesting word                                 in this query the keyword that you have                                 to pass to the search engine is                                 chocolate all the other ones are just                                 noise okay so when and these words are                                 found in the query that you sent to the                                 engine and they are not found in the                                 products that you have indexed for                                 example so they are not stop words from                                 the common terms query point of view                                 okay and you even might have these words                                 like looking or help or could may our                                 please you might even have them within                                 your index indices but they are not that                                 frequent so they are not stop words from                                 the common terms query point of view so                                 actually yeah this is the pitfall so                                 what's the solution the solution would                                 be to index the queries okay so actually                                 you you will take the logs the glogs of                                 your queries the logs from your users                                 and you will index those and then you                                 will run some aggregations on those on                                 top of                                 those and you will see which are the                                 real stop words considering your use                                 case so in this example so I will not                                 show you the demo for that it's really                                 technical and it's connected to                                 elasticsearch but the idea is like you                                 have here on the left the the index the                                 in D the what you indexed from the query                                 logs so the logs that you indexed and                                 they are they are stemmed so this is why                                 you say like way look instead of looking                                 searching they are stand so you you can                                 see that the word I is really frequent                                 seven times because I indexed some                                 queries there actually I indexed all the                                 queries that we have in the in the in                                 the examples you will notice also that                                 four is very frequent and so am the                                 search too then you say okay we'll just                                 apply the standards the standard stop                                 words and you will see that for example                                 four disappeared because it is part of                                 the standards stop words in elastic                                 search for example or in routine but I                                 is not part of that list and neither                                 search searching or looking so yeah you                                 can add some custom stop words which are                                 really connected to your use cases and                                 then remove them so here in the third                                 table you can see that we removed                                 searching looking and yeah we remove                                 some other additional words okay so this                                 is like an admin job and the third one                                 the fourth one the fourth table is like                                 you can also take into account shingles                                 like it you can take expressions that                                 really repeat frequently for example I                                 am searching it's actually repeats three                                 times so you can say okay this is noise                                 I will just remove that so much for this                                 we will move on                                                      so the last one is filter expressed as                                 search keyword so like I said before                                 we'll see some examples so maybe we can                                 move on yeah for example here so we have                                 organic tomato for example an organic                                 can be taken as a filter in order to                                 improve the requests we have another                                 example Simon Warner talks on elastic                                 shot cinnamon can be a filter and can be                                 a filter like type of speaker so maybe                                 you want to go for the solution yeah so                                 the idea is that when you're talking to                                 like widow Widow with your voice yeah                                 these terms will end up as as keywords                                 but they are actually filters so yeah as                                 you said so that the first solution is                                 that you you actually extract entities                                 so how do you extract entities that's                                 another part of the story we will not                                 talk about that here but yeah you figure                                 out a way to extract entities from the                                 users query and for the first example                                 which is organic Tomatoes you say okay                                 the text is tomato and actually the                                 organic there is a filter which is and                                 then you can just ask your search engine                                 organic flag equals true and then you                                 have the query that you will call on                                 your API on the second example you might                                 realize that the name there is actually                                 a speaker so you place it in the into                                 the speaker                                 filter and then you end up with a                                 curried that says the text is                                 elasticsearch the speaker is simon view                                 now and the type of the document that                                 you want to return is a talk now so you                                 just rephrase the query which initially                                 was just a text and it actually                                 contained filters you rephrased it in                                 order to express filters and text the                                 second solution is like it's more                                 simpler like you don't do anything you                                 are just taking the query and throw it                                 out to those                                 search engine and hope the the scoring                                 algorithms will work for you so yeah you                                 hope for the best and this might work                                 but there are some conditions there for                                 example if organic is just a flag that                                 says true or false this will not work                                 because you will not see organic as a                                 word into your data so you have to be                                 careful here yeah you have for example                                 if you have a product base that says                                 yeah tomatoes and the organic indication                                 says just a flag with true and false as                                 a value you might want to transform that                                 to real text and say organic text equals                                 organic or something and the second                                 solution will work for you so here is                                 like the take away so this is what we                                 saw before so first of all the user will                                 speak with his voice then he will                                 translate to the speech-to-text                                 functionality and then the intent and                                 the uterus and the stock part what we                                 saw before just to know exactly what                                 services to call and what are the                                 variables and then you put your search                                 on China and here are the let's say the                                 ends where that we found for these                                 different challenges so for example for                                 the first one in order to to have                                 information even if we don't have like                                 visual device we need to ask question                                 for the second one we need to add filter                                 in order to narrow and to go directly to                                 the result the more relevant result the                                 result for if if you want to add                                 something yes so the the first take way                                 is that the in order you don't respond                                 with a response you respond with a                                 question and the second one is that you                                 don't paginate the results or you don't                                 display ten results you actually add                                 filters to the query so you narrow down                                 the                                 the result because when you talk to the                                 user you can maybe say like so one                                 product or two products but not not for                                 the third one - how to clarify so we saw                                 the facet the cluster ization and the                                 personalization so we just we didn't dig                                 into the personalization thing there but                                 it's really important because                                 personalization allows a search engine                                 to be more relevant and especially this                                 goes especially for voice search if                                 someone else asks for let's say milk on                                 on a grocery store depending who asks                                 the question the response might be                                 different yeah                                 is it body milk is it milk for babies or                                 yeah but if you know the user that asks                                 the question then you can be more                                 relevant and actually you add filters to                                 the query which are taken from the user                                 profile so this is personalization we                                 actually didn't dig into this one but                                 it's it's a way to clarify the request                                 in order to avoid the noise so you need                                 to index query and to create your list                                 of top word regarding to you own use                                 case and the most relevant stop word for                                 your for your problem for uses and last                                 one so the filter that we just saw                                 yeah maybe you want to take this one                                 yeah so this is the query rewriting yeah                                 the one that we saw that you you have                                 like you have like queries that are                                 expect expressed as just text and you                                 rewrite the query to say text and                                 filters yeah so or the second solution                                 you make the filter searchable and hope                                 for the scoring algorithm to work for                                 you so we actually yeah have a have a                                 demo for it for you which kind of                                 emphasizes this part so we will try to                                 make it work                                 so yeah we as you saw we took a search                                 engine which is a classical one                                 we are kind of on this architecture you                                 took a search engine that is this one                                 and we tried to query it through the                                 Google assistant okay                                 sorry I have to stop the presentation in                                 order in order for this to work so here                                 it is                                 so Margot do you want to take that so                                 just bear with us it's like it's a live                                 demo and as you will see there is a lot                                 like machine learning and stuff there                                 and the search engine like needs to to                                 adapt if it's not working we will try to                                 hack it but yeah this is the yeah so I                                 think we will skip this one so in order                                 to launch the application you actually                                 need to say talk to the engine or                                 something like that we just click we                                 just click on the so as you see here                                 it's like all right let's get the test                                 version of a to welcome just what are                                 you looking for today so if we pause a                                 little bit here what you just saw here                                 it's a simulator so the advantage of                                 this and it's the same on a phone you                                 have some display there so the the the                                 search engine actually can give you                                 hints on what's accepted and what's not                                 accepted okay so this is and if you look                                 if you look just a few seconds if you                                 look here actually the input can be                                 voice can be touchscreen or can be even                                 keyboard you can even write queries to                                 the to the to the engine known also the                                 mic is there                                 I found                                                              your favorite brand so what what just                                 happened there is that we had the intent                                 there the so Google assistant found the                                 intent which is I am searching for                                 products because I said I am looking for                                 if Margo would have said I would like                                 some chocolate it might not have worked                                 because the intent was not defined like                                 that okay so this is something that you                                 see on on your on your phone and this is                                 how the engine responded actually                                 because there are too many results there                                 we cannot display                                                      particular search we cannot display the                                 fastest there but the the piece of                                 software that we placed as an adapter                                 just chose a facet out there which                                 happens to be the brand and just                                 responded with a question okay because                                 yeah we have too many results there so                                 yeah let's try let's try this one is                                 difficult to pronounce but yeah we will                                 try like lint yeah                                 you have to talk louder I think                                 the best product I have found for you is                                 Cho : owaru are lint okay you wear for                                 the Sun it's a yeah it's a it's French                                 there so the pronunciation is like so                                 yeah this is the the first product so                                 actually we have not many results of the                                 engine could I mean we took the chance                                 to ask - to answer with a result let's                                 say we don't like this one and then yeah                                 we provide the way to go further well                                 that was a yes but you know it's a yeah                                 we can stop and we just we just send a                                 yes like by keyword and ah yeah just                                 okay okay son Daniel we we have here are                                 the next three products okay                                 now let's imagine that this is not                                 enough so for example if we choose                                 another brand and we still have too many                                 products okay so yeah we have to go from                                 the beginning there are some maybe you                                 can speak I found                                                      what is your favorite brand that's a no                                 surprise there oh yeah go for me oh yeah                                 there's what this one and this                                 understood your request okay try again                                 maybe yeah                                 okay I found                                                            I look in which department okay so this                                 second iteration there are actually                                 still too many products they still                                 cannot be displayed so you could decide                                 to ask a second question okay so to say                                 yeah okay what happens there that was I                                 misunderstood your request if you speak                                 in the mic maybe it will be better                                 that's right so we will just choose some                                 some ice cream there so no no that's                                 that's okay if you say again frozen food                                 it will work frozen food that's the best                                 product I have found for you is glasses                                 show Cola and the knee Milka do you want                                 more results so here yeah you as you                                 noticed you need needed a second                                 iteration so you display the facet at                                 first which was the brand and then                                 another facet which was the department                                 and then there were like not many                                 results so it was it was okay to display                                 them so let's say we don't want any more                                 results and yeah I think I don't know if                                 we have more time or not you can say no                                 yeah thank you all                                 no no                                 I think there's some noise here so the                                 sir it waits for Oh for some more input                                 yeah I misunderstood your request                                 okay so just just type no thank you you                                 are welcome have a great time at Berlin                                 buzzwords okay so that ends the                                 conversation we do with the search                                 engine or so yeah so thank you for for                                 being present and for your patience I                                 hope the French examples didn't bother                                 you too much I don't know if we haven't                                 yet time for some questions if you have                                 questions we'd be happy to respond and                                 if not we'll be around till the end of                                 the day with the conference okay thank                                 you for the talk can you customize                                 suggestion somehow so like if when you                                 we're searching for chocolate you don't                                 get white buttons or anything like                                 outside of your search scope so like if                                 you have like a database of products can                                 you customize voice-to-text                                 to only understand these kind of                                 products you have your database so the                                 question is if we can customize the                                 search engine in order for it to like to                                 to already know that we are looking for                                 some specific product or I'm not sure                                 that I understood the point yeah it's a                                 yeah we need to so actually i'm                                 answering with a question                                 so like to customize the text or the                                 voice to text engine to only suggest a                                 keywords from your database not a                                 generic keywords the suggestions that                                 you saw there are not generic are                                 actually facets that the search engine                                 returns so you have seen oh I don't know                                 if we can scroll up                                 yeah when you say yeah for example if I                                 say I'm looking for chocolates alright                                 here's the test version of a to welcome                                 what are you looking for today I am                                 looking for chocolate so what I'm                                 talking about like this word set for                                 syllable or dairy like this kind of                                 words okay so yeah the dirty                                     products for you what is your favorite                                 brand okay so I understand No                                 so the these suggestions are actually                                 real real suggestions I mean they are                                 present in the database dairy there was                                 not present in the database but actually                                 these are just suggestions you can say                                 something else because it displays the                                 first five the first files value for                                 your facets but not the other one so you                                 actually can say here any word you like                                 so the engine is like kind of it has to                                 take your input into account and if your                                 input is dairy let's say yeah it takes                                 it and it says okay I'll send that to                                 the engine but the answer is like void                                 there's no there's no result there so                                 this is yeah this is a risk and you                                 cannot handle that actually it's a yeah                                 this is the machine learning behind the                                 voice recognition and stuff like that                                 that would get better and better so now                                 this one was trained with several voices                                 because we were several persons to work                                 on this demo and yeah it's normal that                                 maybe it does not understand                                 Margeaux for example right like that but                                 there it should be taken into account                                 yeah so it's actually an information                                 that it's pushed to the engine now thank                                 thanks for the question yeah hi thank                                 you                                 you mentioned that one of the things we                                 don't have with a voice assistant is you                                 called it marketing shortcuts but I                                 think we're all more familiar with it as                                 ads what there's a lot of businesses                                 that would be very upset about that                                 do you have any suggestions on how we                                 can address that actually sometimes we                                 call them best bets they can be                                 something else than ads it depends on                                 the search engine if the certainiy                                 search engine it's it's an enterprise                                 search engine they are not actually ads                                 they are something that the                                 administrator of the search engine                                 what's to push to the user because he                                 knows the the business he knows the meta                                 domain and he knows that maybe the best                                 result for this particular query is this                                 landing page that I already prepared so                                 yeah it's it's a it's an issue yeah how                                 do you push like publicity or admin                                 really admin related results but yeah I                                 mean it's up to you to to build up the                                 the answer that you want so you could                                 have like an algorithm that says okay I                                 have a suggestion from an admin or I                                 have a publicity there you could say is                                 it relevant is it really really relevant                                 more relevant than the results there can                                 I take the risk to display that so it's                                 actually the the green box that it's the                                 adapter between your search engine and                                 the voice assistant that can tell so                                 it's actually something that you decide                                 when you build the the adapter and the                                 voice search engine okay and we take the                                 last question because we are terribly                                 out of time I thank you for the                                 interesting talk so I have a very small                                 question that you spoke about limiting                                 your search results - you were using                                 carrot for clustering face sitting and                                 personalization I'm just wondering how                                 do you Club them and how exactly do you                                 kind of narrow the results down using                                 that so actually carrot is not used for                                 personalization but it's useful for                                 clustering yes                                 so yeah that's that's a great question                                 so clustering algorithms actually allow                                 you to                                 bring facets to some results that do not                                 have facets and then it's up to you how                                 you work with that so you could say for                                 example the example with oranges there                                 was really ambiguous because you had                                 clusters that has had come kind of the                                 same size okay so you could have like                                 some algorithms there some you can't                                 even plug machine learning there to say                                 okay when I don't have facets but I have                                 too many results I will try to use                                 clusters and then if I have like two or                                 three clusters that are as big and they                                 are like they stand out I will ask a                                 question to say okay please give me                                 another another hint like and another                                 hint means like you add another word to                                 the query or lock like and you can even                                 take suggestions from the clustering                                 algorithms for example if we go back to                                 the to the presentation it was yeah so I                                 don't know where it was yeah so yeah you                                 can you could you know even use the                                 words from here so you can say color you                                 can say California you can say orange sa                                 which is the company so yeah and this is                                 just a graphical display but you                                 actually can tell more about that                                 because you can tell that orange sa it's                                 a company so you could also have some                                 additional treatment there in order to                                 transform these clusters into real                                 questions that you asked the user so you                                 could transform these two questions like                                 is it orange the company because this is                                 Wikipedia so you could have some some                                 additional information there is it                                 orange the color so yeah                                 you have some more work to do there in                                 order to adapt your a search engine but                                 yeah it's a it's more complicating than                                 just displaying facets you have filter                                 suggestions from coming from facets yeah                                 thank you so much for for this                                 fascinating talk this is really                                 inspiring thank you for coming and                                 thanks for burning buzzwords for having                                 us and thank you all of you for for                                 having come                                 [Applause]
