Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2019: Erik Hatcher â€“ Chatting with Solr #bbuzz
Publication date: 2019-06-27
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2019 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Building a chat system relies on recognizing known entities being spoken. The Solr Tagger, a powerful unique capability of Apache Solr, provides performant tagging of known, concrete items in free text. Using the Solr Tagger as a first stage of query interpretation provides rich entity metadata that can be leveraged to hone in on user intent.

This session will introduce the Solr Tagger and its myriad of use cases culminating with a chat application that creatively uses the tagger for query interpretation.

This talk is presented by Lucidworks.

	                              all right thank you everybody for coming                               first time in Berlin first time to                               buzzwords I regret not having made it                               here long ago I've been on the program                               committee as he said before and also I'm                               a leucine solar committer and a                               co-founder of lucid works which is the                               platinum sponsor of this event so I'm                               gonna do a talk called chatting with                                solar it is not will Hayes's talk and                                I'll go into that in just a second but                                first I want to give you a word from our                                sponsor                                again not will Hayes's talk his talk                                title was building and scaling a                                high-performance delta performing                                development team he couldn't make it to                                Berlin this week so he commissioned me                                to to fill in and and I couldn't give                                his talk because I can't put words in to                                put my words to his intelligent thoughts                                there so I've made up my own talk over                                the last couple of days when I learned I                                needed to do this and my take on his                                title they're building and scaling a                                high-performing development team is that                                we do that with folks like you folks                                that are passionate smart caring and                                diverse and absolutely with open source                                we're loosing solar spark a zookeeper                                and the whole stack of that those                                technologies we are absolutely hiring                                we're in a very strong growth period                                right now I kind of rift off of Will's                                text here he said his he proposed a fun                                non-technical talk for members of de                                bump teams all levels looking increased                                performance in productivity I kind of                                ripped off of that and came up with my                                own little blurb there in a second and                                I'll show you that come visit our booth                                we have a booth right there in the lobby                                and we're giving away these autocomplete                                t-shirts they're nice and soft and fun                                and the ladies really like them actually                                so good stuff                                so you autocomplete us is what I'm                                riffing on there and saying that we'd                                love to                                further and about your involvement with                                open source with your involvement and                                interest in lucid works all right so                                just kind of a riff off of what we'll                                put in his abstract there this is                                hopefully going to be a fun technical                                talk for development teams at all levels                                looking increase the relevancy and value                                in their search systems and data                                pipelines using solar this is a link                                that I saw this morning I I have                                unfortunately had to stay at the booth                                this entire conference and the rest of                                the day after this talk so I haven't                                been able to see the talks here but you                                know I've see I follow the tweets and                                their and the agenda and there's a lot                                of talks about chat and this is an                                article about how Bank of America has a                                system called Erica that is a chat                                interface to get at banking information                                so there's there's that so without                                further ado we're just going to go back                                to the talk I'm gonna take off this                                corporate shirt here and get back to                                being a developer okay so now we're                                gonna get technical about this stuff                                okay so chatting with solar the ideas                                here it was to build something that                                could respond back to utterances with a                                reasonable response and we're gonna use                                a tool called the solar text tagger to                                be part of the and a very important and                                powerful part of of the system to do                                that so for a while I'm going to talk                                about the solar text tagger which is a                                unique feature to solar and then go into                                a demonstration of the tagger and then                                talk about the the chat system that I                                built and how it leverages the tagger                                okay that's going to be the talk agenda                                there I'm not going to read all this                                this is actually just a copy and paste                                from that link right there I just wanted                                to put it out there so that's in the                                slides                                the solar tagger is a high-performance                                entity naive entity recognizer and it                                does that by you inputting the entities                                that you want to be recognized and then                                 you hit an endpoint into solar that tags                                 that with the entities that it knows of                                 it's a very straightforward tool the                                 output is very sensible the cleverness                                 comes in what you do with this so you                                 can do a lot of things with the tagger                                 and of course this is about doing chat                                 but we're going to talk about a few                                 different use cases there so just to                                 kind of give you a grounding of the                                 basics of the tagger again we tagged                                 concrete known texturing entities tags                                 are actually documents they're they're                                 full-fledged                                 individual documents in a solar                                 collection there's a couple of special                                 things about that solar collection to                                 leverage the tagger there is a field                                 type a change that you need to make you                                 need to make sure that you have this                                 catenate graph filter factory at the end                                 of your analysis chain the index                                 analysis chain so there's kind of some                                 specialized stuff look at the                                 documentation for the taggers see what                                 about how it leverages analysis at query                                 time and an index time there and then                                 there's a specialized endpoint that's                                 not automatically registered in the                                 default solar configuration it's a                                 simple JSON API to enable that tag                                 request Handler and those are the only                                 two pieces that you need to light solar                                 up to leverage this text tagger what can                                 you use this text tagger for you can use                                 it at index time as a preprocessor to                                 take the full text of a document run it                                 through the text tagger grab the known                                 entities that are in the full text                                 document people's names places other                                 entities that you may want to recognize                                 that                                 that are strings that you can match on                                 it will give you back the offsets and                                 the tags there and then at index time                                 you can peel those values away and put                                 them into additional fields for faceting                                 and of course navigation so very useful                                 they're rudimentary in terms of the                                 actual effect but very powerful in that                                 it's very performant and you can have                                 millions of entities in a very high                                 performance manner at query time the                                 tagger can be leveraged for some very                                 clever things use the tags to improve                                 relevancy and how do you do that you                                 peel away things that you know about if                                 you know about the colors and you are a                                 shopping site shoe shopping site and                                 someone searches for blue shoes you                                 recognize blue as a color and so now you                                 have a very specific fielded way to                                 either boost by things that are blue or                                 to filter by things that are blue so you                                 can very easily leverage the text tagger                                 to give you straightforward information                                 like that that can be leveraged to                                 improve relevancy and a straightforward                                 a simple trick like this really really                                 can improve relevancy so very powerful                                 technique there so I'm going to show you                                 the demo is going to build upon on the                                 source of things here's an example of                                 tagging the text buzzwords in Berlin and                                 this is just a screenshot from postman                                 doing a post to the slash tag endpoint                                 and I'm saying here's the text what tags                                 do you know about and the only data that                                 I have in my tagger collection in this                                 example words cities I have a database                                 of or I have a text file of all of the                                 cities in the world that have a                                 population greater than                                        is the data that I'm using in here which                                 is about a hundred and twenty four                                 thousand cities I believe and there's a                                 number of cities named Berlin actually                                 but in this case it picked out a city                                 Berlin and it told me and and I'll go                                 into this a little bit more detailed you                                 see the fields that are being returned                                 their type name and ID name is the very                                 specific field that I'm using as the                                 tagger strings and then I because it's a                                 solar collection I can put in any other                                 fields that I want on to those documents                                 you have one specialized field you could                                 actually have multiple fields that are                                 used for tagging                                 but generally you'd have one field                                 that's used for tagging and then the                                 rest are just freeform whatever field                                 types and that you need to leverage this                                 information and one very valuable piece                                 of information in this kind of custom                                 collection here is just a field a string                                 field called type this gives us some                                 meta information about what type of                                 thing we are tagging in this case I only                                 have cities in there but in another                                 example I'm going to show you I've got                                 colors and brands and cities in there so                                 it disambiguates what type of thing                                 you're talking about and that's just a                                 custom or nothing to do with the tagger                                 it just happens to do with solar and                                 fields in this case for the for the type                                 field the tagger parameters that are                                 being used in that last example are                                 these when you tag text you could have                                 overlapping tags for example there is a                                 brand of product called white linen                                 white is a color but Lin white linen is                                 a brand so if you tag that with a tagger                                 collection that knew about colors and                                 brands what do you want to get back out                                 of that you can get back both of those                                 or you can get back the maximal tags                                 span there so it would only give you                                 back white linen as a brand rather than                                 white as a color                                 again you could get them all back if you                                 want or kind of take the bigger the                                 bigger sets of tags that are                                 non-overlapping so it's up to you how                                 many tags you want back and whether you                                 want them overlapping and so on so again                                 you can and you can limit the number of                                 tags the other tagger special parameter                                 is that match text and that simply gives                                 you back the text that was matched                                 rather than you having to do the math                                 yourself client side and take the                                 offsets and grab the text yourself it                                 just automatically does that beyond that                                 it supports standard solar FQ as well as                                 the FL parameter so you can pick which                                 fields you want back from tag from tags                                 and you can also narrow down the types                                 of things that you are going to tag in                                 the text so if you have cities and                                 colors and brands I could say I'm gonna                                 take this text string and only tell me                                 about the cities that are in it no                                 matter and so ifq type : city this also                                 comes in handy when the data for example                                 cities have a lat/long on them so they                                 have a location and so I can FQ and say                                 only give me cities within a certain                                 radius of a known point perhaps the                                 point that I'm at right now                                 find me food in Berlin which Berlin out                                 of the Dozen of so cities in the world                                 with the word Berlin in their name which                                 one well you know where I'm at from my                                 mobile app let's narrow it down and now                                 straightforward there's only one city                                 that's going to get tagged so that's the                                 parameters for the tagger let's kind of                                 go look at it from a big perspective                                 here the tagger is just a tool it's just                                 a screwdriver or a hammer you can do                                 lots with it it's what you do with it in                                 combination with other things that makes                                 it valuable in your app                                 vacation so just tagging texts is a                                 great parlor trick it's not useful in                                 and of itself you need to combine this                                 with other techniques so for example the                                 text tagger text tags known strings it's                                 not gonna pick out years or dates out of                                 full text unless you had them as tags                                 which would be kind of a ridiculous                                 thing to do so you would use this in                                 conjunction with other techniques that                                 are going to understand the text so you                                 could use regular expressions to pull                                 out four digit numbers or email                                 addresses or URLs or things of that                                 nature the text tagger is not the tool                                 for that so again it works in                                 conjunction with those things and the                                 types of things that you are going to                                 use in conjunction with the context of                                 the query all of the other things that                                 you know about the user and the                                 parameters are coming in on the query                                 and so on so you need to leverage that                                 as well as ultimately natural language                                 processing if that's the the goal of                                 your use case there so again just one                                 piece of the puzzle but a very powerful                                 useful piece of it you need a hammer but                                 it's not the only tool in your toolbox                                 the tagger collection while it is                                 tagging known things you can build that                                 collection any which way you like in my                                 case I'm building it from a static data                                 file of cities in other cases you could                                 use machine learning to populate the                                 tagger collection with things such as                                 head and tail analysis and other query                                 rewrites our own platform lucid works                                 fusion leverages the text tagger in a                                 very big way right now in the as a first                                 stage in the query pipeline and in that                                 stage we are tagging things that we have                                 learned from the usage of the system so                                 misspellings                                 a head and tail analysis and other types                                 of query right rules that are in there                                 so again that's kind of a clever use of                                 the tagger                                 within a tool chain everybody ok so far                                 okay so tagger in perspective let me                                 just show you kind of the end goal of                                 well actually let me take a quick look                                 at my slides here make sure let me let                                 me pause right there and bounce to a                                 demo of the tagger so that you can see                                 just the tagger itself in action                                 I've got postman fired up right here I                                 can send that same text so this is                                 Berlin buzzwords here our buzzwords in                                 Berlin and it matched the word Berlin in                                 offsets thirteen to nineteen and I have                                 that match text turned on so it actually                                 told me that was Berlin I could have                                 computed that by using those offsets                                 into this text but it's a convenience to                                 get that back and I get back a standard                                 solar result set actually it's not                                 relevancy ranked there's no scoring in                                 what you get back you're just getting                                 all of the tags up to the tags limit                                 that that are in that text and it's not                                 in any you know particular order there                                 other than it's just all of them so now                                 it's off to the races what do you do                                 with this well let's see let me show you                                 my tagger demo here's the documentation                                 actually first things first the                                 documentation and I want to point this                                 out because this is an example of very                                 very well done open source contribution                                 a committer for the solar project David                                 smiley created the solar text tagger and                                 then contributed it to solar and he                                 wrote a very nice tutorial about it and                                 it just works right out of the box you                                 fire up solar as                                 is and you run through this tutorial                                 with geonames which is kind of what I                                 based my thing on with a couple of                                 additional fields where you create a                                 collection geonames you run that                                 configuration like I said you need this                                 catenate graph filter in there and then                                 you need the tag request hand tagger                                 request handler there so you can see it                                 got registered as an endpoint slash tag                                 and that's the tagger                                                 now load data now do queries and tags so                                 you can see tag New York City and there                                 it is so I just wanted to point that out                                 because it's a very nice way to                                 understand and have the tagger right                                 there with you know a fairly large                                 amount of of cities they're easily                                 taggable let's see okay so tagger demo                                 let's see I probably ought up a little                                 bit here                                 I did a meetup tour a couple of months                                 ago and this is the demo I did for the                                 meetup tour and one of the stops was in                                 San Francisco so that's why the demo is                                 tailored for that but I could easily say                                 sushi in Berlin and it recognized Berlin                                 as a city but you can see how many                                 Berlin's there actually are in there and                                 you can see where they are so this is                                 the Germany one and so on all the                                 different Berlin's this is the one in                                 Wisconsin I believe it is                                 I don't output which state it's in so                                 you can see actually there's a number of                                 Berlin's in the US actually alright so                                 that's a quick view of this thing so I                                 could do San let me go back to this one                                 because it kind of points out that what                                 I can do with that FQ clause with the                                 tagger and limit which entities I'm                                 going to tag and in this particular case                                 the term San Francisco there's a whole                                 lot of cities named San Francisco out                                 there a lot                                                         matching right now that doesn't really                                 help me find sushi because sushi in San                                 Francisco Costa Rica                                 is not going to get there in time so I                                 have this checkbox here when I check                                 this checkbox it adds an FQ clause that                                 limits it to the lat/long                                 of our headquarters in downtown San                                 Francisco so when I do that and it                                 limits it to within                                                  this point this latitude longitude and                                 now I only get one San Francisco ok so                                 that's the magic of adding an FQ to the                                 tagger to give some context to what your                                 tagging in this particular collection                                 that I have I'm going to show you two                                 demos there are two separate solar                                 collections I have some other entities                                 in here I have a couple of colors in                                 there I have that white linen brand in                                 there and then I have cities so blue                                 there's a color white is a color I don't                                 have red in there just blue and white                                 but white linen is a brand so what we                                 can see down here is I used the                                 parameter to only tag pull the no                                 subtags                                 so I don't get white as a color I only                                 get it as a brand because it's white and                                 then white linen and it removed inner                                 tags and said you just really want the                                 outer ones so I just get brands so I get                                 brand white linen and I get color blue                                 now I could say white linen in Berlin so                                 why did it oh I see I still have this                                 tag so I can't tag cities that are there                                 sorry so let me go back to Berlin all                                 right so I can tag three different types                                 of entities there and you can see I'm                                 still getting a lot of Berlin's                                 but I have the the UI just highlights                                 that that is a tag                                 okay so that's the tagger in a nutshell                                 what it can what it can do gonna go back                                 to the slides                                 alright so basic tagger next up is how                                 to use this tagger within a chat                                 application                                 I created this silly thing called Lou                                 lucid works Lou right so hey Lou who are                                 you and I have a grammar document that                                 responds with I'm Lou from lucid works                                 those other bullet points there are the                                 demo that I'm gonna do as well so I have                                 those supported in in in the system as                                 well here's what Lou does Lou tags and                                 replaces things I called it things                                 people call it entities same thing of I                                 tag things mentioned in the utterance                                 and it gives me back basic information                                 the ID and the type and the name I'm not                                 so concerned about the ID in this case                                 really the type and the name are                                 important here especially the type so                                 and again like I mentioned in this                                 tagger collection you can put in                                 additional fields that are useful to you                                 and type it happens to be one of these                                 the tagger itself doesn't know anything                                 about a type field that's just a                                 construct that I made for this there's                                 two collections there's the things                                 collection and there's the grammar                                 collection the grammar collection is                                 just a straight-up default solar                                 collection                                 nothing specialized in there at this                                 point and that contains utterances that                                 I support that Luz supports and it does                                 it in a slotted way such that I don't                                 have a grammar item that says where is                                 Berlin I have a grammar                                 item that says where is city so when I                                 tagged where is Berlin I replaced that                                 through some processing in the query                                 pipeline with where is city use that to                                 query the grammar collection and now I                                 have a match on that slotted or                                 templated utterance and then I leveraged                                 that the fields in that document tell me                                 tillu what to do with the the grammar                                 match so where is Berlin is at at where                                 is city is attached to an action that                                 says plot that city by lat/long on to                                 OpenStreetMaps so we'll see that in a                                 moment                                 and this describes what I just said I                                 should have gone to the slide earlier so                                 where is Berlin the tagger comes along                                 and says where is Berlin and that comes                                 back with basically the the JSON looking                                 stuff there and then in my grammar I                                 have where is city so you can see type                                 city there again just substituted that                                 in there and looked at and then I render                                 a map makes sense so the next thing I                                 want to point out here before we really                                 demo the the Luo system is that tags                                 this tagger is an immensely valuable                                 feature in a broad ecosystem of search                                 applications and we have embedded the                                 solar tagger in Toulouse it works fusion                                 as a first pass in the query pipeline as                                 such what it does is tags things that                                 have been machine learned from                                 underperforming queries with query                                 rewriting with misspellings that have                                 been detected with we have spark jobs                                 that detect misspellings in the query                                 logs phrase detection and                                 detection all of those get machine                                 learned through spark jobs written to a                                 rewrite collection which is a tagger                                 collection and then at query time this                                 is what the default query pipeline and                                 fusion looks like and the very first                                 stage in our latest versions is that                                 text tagger staged that text tagger                                 stage is built to tag the Q parameter                                 and you can control which of the machine                                 learned pieces that you want to bring                                 into the mix further down the query                                 pipeline and it will use those to                                 replace the query as it goes through                                 okay so now is query time for Lu so                                 let's take a look at Lu and i refresh                                 this we'll get to that colorful thing in                                 a minute I know that I'm gonna have                                 additional time and I am prepared to                                 kind of drill down into the inner                                 workings of this thing so I'm going to                                 show you this kind of methodically and                                 then we'll take it from there and see                                 how much more we break down what what                                 makes this thing tick okay so I can type                                 into this box but I have all of these                                 items over here that I can just click on                                 as if I typed it so I can say hey Lu                                 what time time this is why I'm not going                                 to type them all time is it okay so that                                 utterance went to fusions query pipeline                                 a custom query pipeline that I had                                 developed that hits the tagger in this                                 particular case there's nothing to tag                                 because none of the utterance of the                                 words or phrases in this text                                 are in the tagger collection so it                                 tagged nothing however I do have in my                                 grammar collection and utterance called                                 what time that says what time is it                                 again I strip off hey Lu that's just                                 kind of the prefix there so if that if                                 that's in the front it stripped off and                                 I so I have a grammar that says what                                 time is it and the action of that is to                                 client-side get the time and display it                                 okay so what I'm gonna do                                 refresh the browser here so I have I I                                 built this late last night to set an                                 alert at some point so what I can do is                                 I click this one and again it's just                                 like I typed it hey Lu remind me soon to                                 wrap up this demo what that actually did                                 was set a JavaScript timer in the                                 browser and an alert will pop up in five                                 minutes and you know let us know that we                                 should move on to something else here so                                 we've got that we did the what time is                                 it hey Lou who are you like I just                                 hard-coded some silly things in there                                 nothing is tagged in that utterance                                 either                                 it's just a simple grammar match there                                 hey Lou where are you again nothing is                                 gonna get tagged in that one I just have                                 kind of a hard code of grammar where are                                 you where is Berlin and the zoom level                                 is a little bit is a little bit low here                                 but the lat/long of berlin is there now                                 I my my you I I'm not a UI developer so                                 it's not pretty just functional but I                                 tagged I I list out as I'm doing this I                                 collect in the browser all of the things                                 or all of the entities that have ever                                 been uttered in that session so the city                                 Berlin I can click on that and actually                                 you know get that get that back over                                 here as well                                 where is Berlin we did that one okay so                                 now what is the population of Berlin                                 also in that cities data that I have is                                 population information so just like                                 pulling out the lat/long                                 I pull out the population there I don't                                 know how dated this information is I'm                                 sure it's some years old that data file                                 I happen to live in Charlottesville                                 Virginia so I can do that much smaller                                 town so I have access in the response                                 there all of the fields that are in that                                 document that was put in the tag                                 collection so in the cities again                                 populations there there's there's zip                                 code lat/long it's not zip code sorry                                 country state so there's a there's a                                 number of fields that are there that are                                 useful okay so that's where the tagger                                 came in again I can you know I can click                                 on this entity we mentioned that one and                                 that's you know lovely Charlottesville                                 Virginia and let's see what else because                                 I'm tagging things that are in my                                 collection they're one of the things                                 that I can do is inject additional tags                                 and what I did in fusion was create a                                 data source that index the names of the                                 data sources available so in fusion we                                 have a concept of data sources let's see                                 if I can kind of pop over there to that                                 and let's see one second I should have                                 primed this up here so the things                                 collection so the data sources that are                                 available in my things collection our                                 city's data sources and demo entities so                                 if I run my data sources data source it                                 populates the tagger collection with the                                 names of the data sources and one of the                                 data sources is called cities so what I                                 can do here is learn cities and what                                 that did was hit the Fusion API and                                 started that data source                                 in this case reindex the city's data so                                 I could have other entities that are                                 sitting there off the side that aren't                                 learned yet and then learn those and                                 they would kick those jobs off so the                                 data source cities document looks like                                 this so there's nothing in there other                                 than its of type data source and it has                                 a string called cities that we recognize                                 so very simple there but because I know                                 that it's a data source I can start it                                 right so that type is a very special                                 field in this case and finally last year                                 I kind of I don't know what kind of                                 motivated me but I love this game set do                                 you know the game set the pattern                                 matching game and I thought it would be                                 fun to kind of build a JavaScript                                 version of that just to kind of play                                 around so I built that that's it's open                                 source on my github my personal github                                 and I embedded it in here so I can say                                 hey Lu playset and it pops the board up                                 in there and so I don't know is anybody                                 see a set already in there there should                                 be there's five sets in there I don't                                 really see them that quickly                                 I don't know well I can't think while                                 I'm up here talking but there's five                                 sets in this in that thing that have the                                 right match there so you can play the                                 little game through here so just a cute                                 little Easter egg I put in there all                                 right so I've been given the                                          alert so we've got a just a couple more                                 minutes here I wrote a blog on the                                 tagger as well about the kinds of things                                 that you just saw and that is this right                                 here so using a solar tagger for                                 improving relevancy and I go through the                                 stuff that you just saw a point at David                                 Smiley's awesome presentation that                                 details the gory                                 Lusine magic using finite state                                 transducers and the kind of the term                                 magic and that catenate grass filter and                                 all that he said goes very detailed into                                 that and then I just go through the same                                 thing of tagging cities and then you can                                 pull the color blue off and boost or                                 filter by blue if somebody searches for                                 blue shoes right so now you've got                                 better relevancy based off of that so                                 there's that and let me just show you                                 this one real quick so our chief                                 algorithms officer Trey Granger took                                 where I was with this tagger and thought                                 of something even above and beyond                                 thinking that I had about this stuff and                                 he created commands that were tags and                                 used the semantic knowledge graph which                                 is another very special feature of solar                                 and put all of that stuff together and                                 when you say and haystack was a                                 conference where he presented this so                                 haystack in Charlottesville Virginia                                 which is and his tagger                                 parlance is an event that is tied to a                                 venue that is tied to a location so you                                 have to he used the graph parser to                                 navigate from venue to for event to                                 venue to location and then use the the                                 tagger to tag near                                 to get the command that means that                                 you're gonna do a geo centric query                                 there and they use the semantic                                 knowledge graph for the pieces that were                                 left over so that barbecue b BQ expands                                 - meaning things that are restaurants                                 that in the terms from the semantic                                 knowledge graph our b BQ ribs brisket                                 pork and type restaurants so all of that                                 with a couple of pieces of technology                                 from solar                                 so in conclusion and i have a pointer                                 there to trace stuff so please go visit                                 that i'm very impressed by this i'm                                 gonna start building stuff on top of the                                 way he's doing it now seeing this                                 cleverness so in conclusion the solar                                 tagger provides known entity tagging of                                 text it's very fast even on large text                                 it's a great first stage i would dare                                 say a necessary first stage in most                                 scenarios that provides valuable                                 metadata and matching there that can be                                 leveraged to enhance query                                 interpretation and result relevancy and                                 it's useful in an index pipeline                                 preprocessor to extract known entities                                 and peel those away so that you have                                 known things as facets or navigation                                 alright so that's the conclusion of the                                 Taggart talk while I have your attention                                 I will invite you to our happy hour                                 tonight                                 I don't know Berlin but apparently this                                 is only like a eight minute walk from                                 here so please join us tonight for some                                 beer and there's that let's see also I                                 want to remind you visit our booth get a                                 free t-shirt we do not want to carry                                 these things home we would love for you                                 to carry it home yourself thank you                                 [Applause]                                 I'm happy to take questions if there's                                 time sure um since we have run out of                                 time maybe one or two questions if you                                 have any any questions                                 so you mentioned indexing like in real                                 time right when you can just trigger                                 this endpoint for cities if you have a                                 big collection of those whatever                                 entities or things that you're having                                 does it also influence performance of                                 your as a request or is it like just                                 forking and somewhere in the background                                 what is the cost of running that for big                                 collection the text tagger is extremely                                 fast so it's not a performance                                 bottleneck in that case if even having a                                 lot of tags is not a problem based off                                 of the data structure the way the and                                 you can look at David Smiley's thing to                                 see how it does it does it's magic                                 so I would not say that there's going to                                 be you're gonna encounter any issues one                                 of the interesting things about the                                 tagger collection is that because the                                 documents are generally small you could                                 create a very large tiger collection                                 millions and millions of documents that                                 that readily fit in a single core single                                 node a single shard scenario and so one                                 of the best practices that comes out of                                 this is that because you're going to be                                 running your text tagger a lot is to                                 replicate that tagger collection to all                                 your nodes so that they are just right                                 there handy rather than having it just                                 on a single node okay with that we come                                 to the end of this session we thank you                                 so very much for for having joined us                                 and we thank you for thank you speaking                                 [Applause]
