Description: 
	Pedro Balage talking about "Why data-driven methods will shape the future of relevance search".

You already have your search engine in place, users have started using it and now see that your results could do better. You hire some engineers to get you through this and they included a synonym here, an exception there, and asked you to create a taxonomy to organize your items. After a few months,  everything seems to work fine except for a few minor issues that you got your team working on. 

Now, your company needs to expand to meet the new demands of your business, so you get a wider range of products in your catalog. Your search results start to show some issues and your team is having a hard time controlling all of your search parameters and maintaining rules and exceptions. You know that improving your results will be the key to the success of your company. You now get yourself the biggest decision to make: should I hire more relevance engineers to handle it?

The first part of this talk will show why it is so complicated to scale an engineering approach of relevance based only on synonyms, taxonomies, rules, and exceptions. As a consequence of these limitations, the second part will focus on the latest advancements of natural language processing and information retrieval to show that all you need are good data scientists responsible for providing new data-driven solutions to your needs without causing any change into your search stack. 

With the vast amounts of data collected, you can find applications of it for all your search needs. The talk will guide you through topics such as language modeling for autocompletion, deep neural networks for named-entity recognition, network embeddings for relevance score, and query-product embeddings to improve the discoverability of your most exquisite items. All of this, optimized by your learning-to-rank algorithm and enabling you to personalization capabilities.

	                              take a remote for evolution hello                               everyone good afternoon my name is petit                               balázs I'm currently lead data scientist                               at four fetch for fetches online                               e-commerce of fashion we have offices in                               Portugal we have offices in London and                               have offices worldwide today I'm not                               going to talk about for fetch I'm going                               to talk about how can you drive your                                search teams into the future using                                data-driven methods so to start the                                topic I will put a question here and I                                am going to ask you that what do you                                think about relevant search so some of                                you may not know search where may not                                know what means relevant search in the                                context of a commerce search so input                                some words and I explain later so                                relevant search is the ability to you to                                retrieve relevant results meaningful                                results you don't want to retrieve the                                results that are not cool to the user                                given the query or results that or you                                you don't want to miss out results that                                could be retrieved and the user could                                click and buy your product for example                                and the question that I put it because                                relevant searcher is today it's kind of                                art because it's a very complex and                                difficult thing so but before entering                                in relevant search entering the search                                problem let's start from and by the way                                this presentation is going to have some                                pieces of art let's start from the                                beginning this of how search teams are                                created and how relevant search comes                                into play so in the start when a company                                decides to implement some search                                mechanism for example does anybody have                                a search interface to the user it                                usually does not cause specialists that                                sit together in the table and have a                                very long run plan about how your search                                will be developed usually you call                                someone who is his CV has like elastic                                search or Solaire or something like that                                and ask okay could you please implement                                a search engine for us and that                                technician guy implement a search engine                                that works pretty well it's very simple                                straightforward to implement                                out-of-the-box solution nowadays so                                initially you focus on very technical                                specs you put that search engine to work                                but later when you run your business you                                starting figuring out that some of your                                results are not relevant or you are not                                retrieving given the queries you're not                                retrieving results that a user may like                                or you were treating a lot of results                                that the user is really not looking for                                so later it comes the attention to the                                search quality and we have a problem                                here                                the company starts to having a lot of                                pain problems or pain points first the                                lack of planning ahead so remember that                                you just put in place a search engine                                but you didn't figure out what the mens                                of expertise for your engineering team                                or for your search team in order to run                                this search engine so it kind of                                restricts the growth of your company and                                you know that any company nowadays needs                                to grow needs to be ahead of its                                competitors also you and probably that's                                the case you have a very good team of                                engineers that understands the technical                                specs of your relevant or your search                                engine but they like some expertise in                                search quality                                so usually you ask that guy that's                                usually a programmer or a DevOps to                                implement some relevant search                                measurement so to look for synonyms to                                look for related words to tweak boosts                                and that guy like oil I like to program                                I don't like to look for results and                                would like to really checking search                                quality and that complexity of imposing                                relevant search tasks to the team it                                just grows over time so it gets more and                                more complex                                let's check why so and just before I                                just give you some initial thoughts                                about relevant search revel search is a                                very difficult thing to state what it is                                so it's better to say what you should                                not have                                 and then you can understand what                                 relevant search is important so in your                                 search engine what what are the things                                 that should not happen                                 you should not retrieve him you are also                                 what should not happen you are                                 retrieving items that are not relevant                                 so we put a coil you have a product and                                 that product is really doesn't what you                                 want to just do by to your commerce or                                 your missing items that are relevant so                                 some our products are made it scribe                                 with other words and then your queries                                 just returning that specific words that                                 the user party for and then therefore                                 you don't have these products in your                                 search results or you are showing the                                 items but the top toppest items are not                                 the relevant ones and then you have a                                 problem of rank ranking here some steps                                 sure relevant search there is very                                 famous books available for relevant                                 search for tweaking ask search Solar in                                 terms of relevance and most of them are                                 more technical but in a matter of points                                 that a relevance engineer or someone in                                 your company that may address relevance                                 can work it's you can tweak the relevant                                 score the way that you score your                                 products against the queries that the                                 users are doing for example can use                                 tf-idf that's a common metric in                                 information rhythm or PM                                               current metric of relevance that's it's                                 a variation of tftf that's play main                                 data for elastic search for example you                                 can use mood feud matching so you're not                                 just looking for your product name but                                 for a product description or for some                                 categorical attributes of your product                                 and then as you're looking for different                                 fields you may need to require boosting                                 so I want that a match in the name of                                 the products more it should be much more                                 relevant than a matching the description                                 that should be more relevant that may be                                 imagining some attributes so you need to                                 boost distinctly itchy food and then you                                 need to go to match or sale you how you                                 match two strings so you could use a                                 phrase matching matching the whole                                 string you could use query matching so                                 the terms in your query could                                 match isolated and then you can consider                                 if you're gonna use a composition from                                 chef both and you can use for example                                 for the matching that you're gonna match                                 in terms that could contain month letter                                 change it for example could have some                                 fuzziness true to the original term some                                 tech normalizations could also happens                                 in place for a simple steaming dealing                                 with florals or for example gender                                 variations of the words are something                                 that we usually do in search engines you                                 may require two synonyms taxonomy and                                 ontology that are somehow ways to                                 include more knowledge to a retrieval                                 and at the end you can you can resort to                                 rules and exceptions so this is more or                                 less a guide for someone that's working                                 relevant search we try from the top and                                 then we're trying to do things that are                                 more or less common to all your keywords                                 and at the end if nothing works you just                                 put an exception the problem of putting                                 rules and exceptions and to resource to                                 use resource like synonyms taxonomy is                                 how to keep them all right                                 and my question to you is how is this                                 human thing they control over all these                                 parameters so if you are a relevance                                 engineer if you're taking care of the                                 relevant search of your e-commerce                                 search how do you keep track of all the                                 chains how you maintain control this is                                 something very complex alright is a                                 complex test because there is a lot of                                 notes and knobs and buttons that need to                                 press in order to configure URL ask                                 search for example search engine in your                                 ears over here and not usually they are                                 independent let's say that if you change                                 the boosts you may also need to change                                 for this infrequently synonyms if you                                 change the synonyms you know you need                                 also to review some rules and then they                                 are very dependent tasks so that's why                                 they are complex and at the same time I                                 asked for youth                                 to work in a company that is targeted                                 for the future is looking for growing                                 looking for opening markets how do you                                 expect to work in such environment that                                 you need a complex team that you need to                                 develop complex tasks in order to do                                 very based not basically but a very                                 straightforward thing that is relevant                                 search so we are in an area of                                 disruptive innovation we really want to                                 be ahead of competitors we really want                                 to deliver excellence what happens for                                 example if you have new products if you                                 receive for example a batch of you                                 duplicate your catalog for example all                                 the parameters all the knobs that you're                                 read finally tune it in your search end                                 engine needs to be changed again or you                                 open to new markets or you have for                                 example new categories what happens if                                 you want to pursue internationalization                                 of your business if you want to go to                                 China or go to Russia or go to Arabic                                 countries how are gonna deal with those                                 languages do you need to require to hire                                 more relevant engineers to hire more                                 people who are going to scale in this                                 age one thing for sure is that you                                 require first adaptation and if you                                 don't have a dictation you are not going                                 to last too much in the business so my                                 questions to you first question is                                 whether searches a kind of heart and I                                 agree with you with that and there are                                 other questions can really well search                                 be more signs and then now I'm gonna                                 take more towards my bias and can ask                                 you if that could be a data science                                 because I'm from data science background                                 so if you analyze just what kind of data                                 because the science is based on the                                 collection processing and ultimate isin                                 twos based on data what kind of data do                                 we have and we have a lot of data for                                 example have search logs we know what                                 the users are searching or nor website                                 we have clicked through logs what the                                 user are clicking we have navigation                                 logs we understand how the user is                                 navigating between pages what's the user                                 track we have user preferences if the                                 user is a                                 for or have some preference for one                                 specific category or bought some                                 specific products we can also resource                                 go to a/b testing if you want to collect                                 more data specific to some hypothesis                                 that we want to verify and you can go                                 you can go to external sources so for                                 example you can look for our competitors                                 or can download some database that are                                 available online in order to improve                                 your your search engine so the lesson                                 here is that we have a lot of data and a                                 lot of an expert data how to export this                                 data so data size contains both                                 statistical methods to export data and                                 also some machine learning methods to                                 automate the exploration or to make some                                 classification some decision function                                 based on the data and the lesson that I                                 want to bring here is that machine                                 learning is not a very difficult thing                                 no matter facts very easy ok if you look                                 for and it is machine learning is just a                                 mathematical function let's remember                                 Euler and a definition of mathematical                                 function that you receive a some                                 parameter in the case a data all right                                 and you try to model that using some                                 parameters that it's not the case for us                                 to discuss right now but it's just                                 trying to mimic some behavior and then                                 to produce an output ok the output of                                 that function so you have an input data                                 you model that function to a training                                 algorithm that is going to be your                                 machine learning algorithm and then you                                 have a prediction the difference between                                 your prediction your truth data is what                                 your training our team is gonna look is                                 gonna look for the patterns it's gonna                                 input these patterns in your function                                 and you're going to work with that so                                 matter of fact is just a mathematical                                 functions very simple so how can I use                                 so if machine learning the mathematical                                 function how can I use machine learning                                 to build better                                 search engines the traditional approach                                 and the approach that I'm gonna pursue                                 in the second part of this talk is this                                 one                                 so usually have different modules in the                                 different modules you could have                                 for example solutions in place that                                 could be provided for your search engine                                 or solutions that you could have a                                 machine learning module in place you                                 could have a round complete module you                                 are complete it's gonna give you out                                 complete or suggestions is gonna give                                 you hints to your user in order to                                 search for am a more specific term                                 you're gonna you're gonna have a query                                 understanding we're going to understand                                 your query and what are the parts are                                 carry and what the what the user                                 intention you're gonna have a query                                 expansion we're going to take this quite                                 understanding and trying to go to your                                 database and retrieve retrieve items                                 that are relevant to that your original                                 understanding you're going to try to                                 risk or designs that you retrieved for                                 some products you were ranked then                                 you're gonna have your final products                                 that's more or less a traditional                                 architecture of search of course in                                 order to provide data to all these                                 modules or all these mathematical                                 functions machine learning components                                 you have your click locks and now the                                 data that you have in your e-commerce                                 but when it said that we are going to                                 use data when in gain gonna use machine                                 learning you also come up in your mind                                 ok that guy's going to talk about you                                 baloney                                 all right or that guy's going to talk                                 about some very weird to think that's                                 gonna come queries products I'm gonna                                 bed everything to the same space and                                 predict in a matter of fact this is the                                 modern approach there is some talks in                                 the past here a bit I guess at building                                 buzzwords as well to how to do product                                 search using full end-to-end deploying                                 approach ok so one thing that you could                                 do is you have a queries you can have an                                 encoding layer to encode the text in                                 your queries in some numerical vector                                 space so you have a numerical                                 representation for queries you have your                                 products you can have for example your                                 product to name your product                                 descriptions your product attributes in                                 your product image and embed everything                                 into encoding layer into again internal                                 miracle representation of a product and                                 if you use a mathematical function and                                 autoimmune                                 that's gonna map this to representations                                 this modeling is gonna use the click                                 logs to understand which queries lead to                                 each products and it's going to build a                                 representation forever to your modem the                                 modem on the reports are amazing they                                 are in that scientific perspective they                                 are the most beautiful thing I ever saw                                 in information three of them but they                                 didn't work so well it's not the it's                                 not effect so it's not the fact that                                 they didn't work they work myself and my                                 company with my team we tested some deep                                 learning and twin approach they worked                                 it pretty well but they have some issues                                 some issues that we need to do for                                 example bias in the data the                                 distribution the data you have more                                 products that are popular than the                                 products that are not popular and how do                                 you deal with unpopular products or                                 products that do not have data to model                                 your your your algorithms how are you                                 tweak for example you're learning                                 functions or how do you do if your loss                                 functions so there is a lot of                                 challenges ahead and I think that's why                                 we are not still using that but I bet                                 that in the future you're gonna see more                                 and more these fool Tomatoes end-to-end                                 approach but here today I'm going to                                 talk about more more traditional                                 architectures why because these                                 architectures are very solid we know I                                 know companies that are using this                                 architecture so it's tested industry                                 tested and the tech sector is very easy                                 to be interpreted so if you're if you're                                 relevant search if your query is not                                 working you can open the components                                 understand why okay and then you can                                 support weekly support business needs if                                 somehow someone or some of your boss                                 knock your door and ask I want that done                                 in two hours you're gonna be not going                                 to be able to open the machine learning                                 the neural network foo n                                               in order to tweak that but here you can                                 add one rule add one exception it's much                                 easier true to work with so in this talk                                 this is the second part I'm gonna I hope                                 I convinced you that it's necessary to                                 have a better approach to relevant                                 search that's not as complex as to                                 someone to look for all that complexity                                 that is to have synonyms to work with                                 rules to work with parameters in your                                 search ends engine and then I'm going to                                 show you what's the path chordate                                 relieved in search engine so remember                                 the architecture that is poke you about                                 we're going to start talking about out                                 complete suggestions why does this                                 components is most is one of the most                                 component well important components for                                 your company because it's here that you                                 drive your users to what he's looking                                 for most of the users start searching                                 but they don't have a quite idea about                                 what you're looking for especially if                                 you are in a very specific domain for                                 example fashion and the user is not a                                 specialist of that domain so the user                                 does not know the terms of that domain                                 to search for and then enough complete                                 you can help or support user in the                                 exploration of your products there is a                                 lot of alternatives so the most simple                                 one you can implement that in a sequel                                 database                                 it's a feud based not complete so we                                 just do that in select field like and                                 you put like you just select thing in                                 your field are the words that started                                 with that prefix it's a very simple                                 thing most of the companies are doing                                 that what's what's not so good because                                 it's very done you could also go to more                                 sophisticated methods for example a                                 phrase database not complete what does                                 it means it means that you go to your                                 search logs you go to your click logs                                 and understand what the user is                                 searching for and then you score the                                 items that the user is searching but how                                 do you do that for example you have a                                 vocabulary things that the user usually                                 type let's say that you have                                            and then you build a phrase database of                                 the combination of all these words and                                 within this phrase database you can have                                 for example score this based on your                                 training database in your search use use                                 and then offer to the user in the                                 autocomplete function okay one thing                                 that's important                                 the                                 of course you you should prune this                                 database because for example if you have                                 two thousand items and you have just                                 three words is two thousand in a                                 combination of three times it's eight                                 billion times so you don't have a                                 database it's your keep that and it's                                 just three words say we need to have                                 some pruning mechanism for that one more                                 wise way to do what complete it's called                                 language modeling language modeling just                                 to simplify you is what Google does when                                 you go to Google search and it                                 understands you it's the language                                 modeling place so you could use a more                                 probabilistic approach using hidden                                 Markov models so you are modeling the                                 probabilistic jump from one word draw                                 the water from one character to other                                 character all right using hidden Markov                                 models or you could go to neural                                 language modeling then your language                                 modeling is the actual state of the art                                 for this kind of tasks so this is the                                 one I'm gonna exemplify badan and just                                 to to tell you that's very learning very                                 easy to learn such model you have a                                 query you have your computer model your                                 autocomplete is learning for click locks                                 and hear yourself contain some learning                                 model that's going to provide you the                                 autocomplete function so language                                 modeling they standard language modeling                                 consists of recurrent neural networks                                 that are these building blocks here and                                 some embedded the space for them tokens                                 could be the words or the characters you                                 embed that to space that's very good for                                 modeling because it don't have the                                 restriction of how many words do you                                 have you just embedded that to mean                                 space and because it's a recurrence so                                 it's the same cell that's recruiting                                 time over time you are unbounded by the                                 sentence length so it could have                                 sentences you could have queries of all                                 sizes so you're going to suggest for                                 example a tenth or the length or how                                 many words would you require and at the                                 end you have modeling that with data you                                 have the probability of scene                                 a phrase seeing some set of words to                                 predict the next word there is some                                 vector representation of words exist in                                 the literature you're going to find                                 words of X a very popular one                                 you also have aquarium rec there is no                                 reference here and the slides are                                 already available if you want to                                 download it's good because you have                                 involved in vocabulary and sentence                                 sizes and it's very important because                                 you can extend that language model for a                                 sequence to sequence model and for                                 example to adapt to do with Spelling's                                 the user are doing right but it's                                 missing some character you're out                                 completes not gonna work anymore in this                                 case it's gonna work because it's gonna                                 be permissive to spelling errors any                                 could also have different words so it                                 starting looking for as some word and                                 you have synonyms of that word you could                                 not just not complete but out suggest to                                 the user all right so there is a lot of                                 different words in this direction quite                                 understanding so the second step after                                 or this is the first step or completed                                 they start a self-contained so the                                 cornerstone is the first step towards                                 the total search relevance you could                                 have different reports again you                                 couldn't percolate your query there is a                                 function in the major search engines                                 that you could percolate queries and use                                 that percolated results to understand or                                 to match individual words against feuds                                 in your database ok there is a lot of                                 documentation about that or you could                                 use some naming recognition system the                                 name it recognition system is the most                                 advanced in user approach where you're                                 going to look for your sequence of words                                 and understand when each word belongs or                                 not your category trend or a size or                                 true product name or true product or                                 attribute alright so you're gonna find                                 naming these these entities in your                                 queries there is the conditional run of                                 huge that's their standard another                                 protein there's again the neuro                                 name is recognition system that's the                                 current state of the art so the narrow                                 name is recognition system it's very                                 similar                                 the language model we have again the                                 embedding layer we're going to embed                                 each word that's a lexical                                 representation into a numeric space and                                 that's the trick of the near approach                                 you need to embed that in America's                                 space in that numeric space could for                                 example model some similarity among                                 words in the case of word track for                                 example when used Latin Bernese you're                                 gonna have an LST M lane because that                                 gets to be directional because it it                                 goes to both sides                                 Alice TM it's AI space it's it's a unit                                 that's some specification of the                                 recurrent neural networks Steve a                                 recurrent neural network but with some                                 pluses let's say it's the most                                 traditional approach to resilience for                                 for this kind of task then you project                                 for each word some projection of your                                 state from the likes TM to a finer state                                 where you're going to do some global                                 some global normalization using Viterbi                                 algorithm that gonna provide the output                                 for each word the label that each word                                 has for example if I have the first word                                 that's a category is gonna say is a                                 category the second word may be an                                 attribute it is an attribute the third                                 word may be starting for example Brent                                 I'm gonna say this word is starting a                                 brand that the second word is going to                                 be the continuation of that brand and                                 and so on okay why'd you use neuron                                 image recognition state-of-the-art it's                                 it's really one of the best it's not                                 just a little bit more complicated it's                                 in a matter of fact it's simpler then                                 let's hear if the models are very easy                                 you could that you could that in Python                                 with six or seven lines of code using                                 standard frameworks for deep learning                                 it's very easy to do that it could do                                 with some word variations when use some                                 character in bindings for that and                                 misspellings usually requires                                 what's cone here but it's something that                                 we're used to in machine learning you                                 require data to Train                                 so it may require some human annotate                                 chill a/b label you some data with                                 entities there is how some companies                                 that could provide that and there is a                                 set of open-source libraries available I                                 know that saloon for example a very                                 interesting and good company                                 open-source the Flair that's a framework                                 to do name it recognition it's among the                                 state-of-the-art of tools for that is                                 very simple to use okay                                 second component in my opinion the most                                 important one query expansion okay I                                 understood the query so I have the                                 annotated a query stating which sky                                 category which the designer which the                                 term that I don't know what can I do in                                 terms of search with that that query                                 expansion module is gonna tell me what I                                 should do for example I could go to a                                 faceted search when for example if the                                 user just put a word that for me means a                                 category                                 I just want to apply the category filter                                 on a website and retrieve all the                                 results from that category I don't                                 really need to go to retrieving a lot of                                 items I just apply facets here I could                                 go to different paths so imagine here in                                 the CRO explanation model that you have                                 a to its position its position so                                 several additional knowledge ease okay                                 and effort each additional knowledge you                                 don't know too much if that's gonna help                                 or not                                 so you're going to take different paths                                 you're gonna in q                                                  facets in key to try synonyms or maybe                                 expand similar words in q                                           Scientologist knowledge graphs you can                                 have for example taxonomy zoom:                                  ontology and all other so it's not                                 bounded it to four okay just president                                 purification can have as many as you                                 wish of course there is here Samara                                 Samsung engineering                                 concern but let's say that you can have                                 as many different components as you want                                 and it can also have some graphic based                                 techniques i will exemplify this last                                 one that's a very interesting one to                                 extract from Dayton if we look for our                                 click logs what you're gonna find we're                                 gonna find in one side                                 queries in and other side I think that                                 we retrieve usually products for a                                 commerce okay and you guys see that said                                 one query lead to a click in one product                                 and another and another or the query                                 needed to click to other products what                                 kind of information and that's my                                 question you can I were to affirm that                                 that's a lot of things work with so                                 there is a lot of information that's led                                 latent to this representation one                                 example I could look for all the queries                                 that are related if you one query led to                                 the semi-products exactly the same                                 products as the other query the two                                 queries are similar okay if the                                 intersection of the products that two                                 queries led to are like eighty ninety                                 percent I could say that they are eighty                                 ninety percent similar okay you could                                 retrieve that the same in the product                                 side I could look for the product side                                 and see which products are similar so                                 they should be clustered together and if                                 you look some products that are very                                 similar and one query is not is                                 retrieving this product but not the                                 other I could for example tell my search                                 engine to hit rip the other project and                                 send that additional information you                                 could also do some transferring so I                                 understand direct Perry B contains some                                 terms some words and then I'm gonna                                 transfer these attributes to the other                                 products that the query B is related                                 true okay these products they contain                                 attributes as well as gonna and then I'm                                 gonna transfer back these attributes and                                 I'm gonna jump in from one side or the                                 side transferring this knowledge and                                 then the end I'm gonna converge in the                                 same vector space of representation of                                 wolf sites okay that's the idea for                                 example of a vector propagation there is                                 the paper here it's a very interesting                                 work we already work refactor this kind                                 of techniques and they are they are very                                 good we couldn't go further graphing                                 banning is one of the most recent                                 techniques                                                              it's more specific graphic embeddings                                 true recommendation systems but it works                                 perfectly in such results and then you                                 can use all these informations to                                 to improve your search queries of course                                 I got a lot of results and then I got                                 results from q                                                       some results I have the same products                                 for all these I have extreme products                                 how am I going                                 risk or that bunch of scores okay                                 because I have different paths in each                                 path my me trust a little bit more a                                 little bit less for that I'm gonna use a                                 parameterized model or parameterized a                                 function this is very used to the                                 literature for example the goo-goo                                 engine uses that okay this is a very                                 simple function here I'm going just to                                 interpolate out this course for each                                 product all the scores that are received                                 in this lanes let's say by some lambda                                 factor so lambda                                                   it's a numeric value that's gonna tell                                 the importance of the Q                                                  the numeric value that's gonna tell the                                 importance of kitchen and so on                                 I could also have a very more detailed a                                 machine learning model but I'm just                                 going to attain to the simplicity of                                 this concept here and then I may use                                 some click logs children so I have for                                 example here I receive a product here                                 I didn't he or no here I received my                                 score here another here another and this                                 product was click 'add so I'm going to                                 reinforce that this is called a right if                                 the product are not click 'add for                                 example or are miss it we can tell also                                 to to the learn mechanism that it should                                 not be enforced for example you could                                 use some learning in the direction of                                 course after I have a lot of products                                 and I have a lot of products wrist cord                                 remember that I expanded my knowledge                                 so I'm retrieving more products than                                 necessary so instead of retrieving just                                 like                                                                  don't want to display to user then                                      products I want to find that the point                                 and I and then here I assume that they                                 are rain                                 by relevance I want to find a point                                 where the problems are not really want                                 to declare anymore and then I'm going to                                 start from top to down and find a point                                 where I'm gonna cut that so for example                                 in your last you have some threshold cut                                 that you could impose to your search and                                 say after that relevance score                                 I mean don't want more lightens okay                                 that's aesthetic you could use a more                                 dynamic approach for example using the                                 standard deviation of your results it's                                 better or you could also use machine                                 learning to determine debt so use                                 machine learning based on click logs of                                 course you're going to need to start                                 with a more permissive approach you're                                 gonna need to show to the users more                                 items so the user may click or not click                                 and then you're going to learn a                                 function in order to understand where is                                 the best point to cut so far so good                                 perfect so the last one is about ranking                                 I'm not going to pay so much attention                                 about ranking because the ranking there                                 is a lot of algorithms the algorithms                                 themselves they have a lot of different                                 mathematical concepts but here I just                                 want to mention you that they already                                 have my relevance results so I'm a                                 relevant search ends here okay I read                                 have the set of results that are                                 relevant but for some aspects I want to                                 hear rank then I I know that they are                                 relevant but I want to rank for example                                 to improve my profitability of my                                 business                                 right so I want to put the Polish that                                 has more margin of gain first or for                                 example I have some business decisions I                                 want to boost the sales or for some                                 brand or for some partner alright so for                                 that the ranking it's a module itself                                 and then in the ranking capability to                                 have different irregular items they are                                 pretty standard some of them already                                 implemented in the most recent search                                 engines or the most standard search                                 engines and you can work with them okay                                 but at the end just true to conclude my                                 line of thought                                 showing you how these components I could                                 say odds components they are machine                                 learning and then I said to you that                                 machine learning is a function so if I                                 have for all the components machine                                 learning I have a set of functions one                                 of the other if I now work in that way a                                 set of the following functions it's so                                 every company into a subject                                 architecture is a function a composition                                 of functions is also a function so every                                 how that architecture is here is a                                 single function of course you could                                 componentize that you could work with                                 different components but what I'm                                 explained to you is that as as I'm                                 inputting data from our logs and then                                 extracting some predictive models I                                 could work that as a single function I                                 could work with that as I have just one                                 function that you tell me relevance and                                 I don't want to look for synonyms I                                 don't want to look for nerds and knob                                 knobs and buttons that I need to push in                                 this search engine anymore so it's much                                 more simpler more as it's a function I                                 could condition that function to                                 particular interests so for example I'm                                 taking my data and I might here you                                 understand that I take you the holiday                                 to but if I want to have a specific view                                 for an user segment so I know that some                                 specific users the VIP uses for example                                 they bought more of this product or some                                 users are more trained in to buy some                                 ordered specific product or I'm pushing                                 some marketing of veins or I want to do                                 if originality issues or example they                                 uses in the same country from one place                                 are different from the user from the                                 other place I could segment those data                                 this data all right so I have a                                 conditional data have a data segmented                                 for that particular interest that I have                                 I'm gonna train the same learning                                 relevant search flying function and I'm                                 gonna have another function here did you                                 this is a distinct function I could                                 apply that for some cases I don't have                                 enough data or my functions not strong                                 enough this new function G what I could                                 do is to use the mood for models so I                                 could use a composition function between                                 F that was my first function and                                 gee that's more my conditional function                                 alright and I can use a composition of                                 both so I gotta catch get score of F and                                 get score of G and try to compositions                                 functions by some parameter I said learn                                 and then I gonna have a friend of idea                                 okay                                 Rama wrap up the lessons that I want to                                 send to you should tell you is that                                 companies that have has have a                                 significant value of search should focus                                 more than dated research methods as a                                 way of scaling open new markets                                 you only can survive in some deductive                                 innovation scenario work with                                 state-of-the-art working new                                 technologies that's going to allow you                                 to grow it's going to allow you to scale                                 and then I believe it's on my personal                                 belief that data-driven methods are the                                 path to that data scientist are                                 important they provide data-driven                                 approach to research more than that they                                 are not just why data scientist what not                                 macchina engineers but not research                                 scientists because in my opinion data                                 science are the ones who can look for                                 your data who can clean your data                                 because there is a lot of workload to                                 clean your data to prepare your data to                                 train your machine many models that I                                 believe that's not the case true and                                 this fully understand the machine model                                 to develop new machinery mods because                                 they already exist you just need to                                 understand what there is and work with                                 that okay and then they need to                                 understand the results and you need to                                 link with the business they need to                                 understand the business requirement here                                 I don't want to implement AFER's some                                 complex and fancy framework I want to                                 deliver results to the business and                                 that's why I think data science are good                                 on that relevance engineers there is                                 important I don't want to send you the                                 message that we don't don't need then we                                 need we need but I think the relevance                                 engineers should focus more on relevant                                 search quality measure search quality                                 tell us that we are doing right or wrong                                 and of course if there is some quickly                                 demand of the business please change                                 that please make that search work they                                 are there for that ok they could provide                                 some adjustments very quickly so                                 remember in the beginning of the talk                                 and just to                                 I mentioned to you that relevant search                                 may be an art or maybe a science in my                                 opinions both okay and a message that I                                 want to send you is that data-driven                                 methods are the future or relevant                                 search and just for context this paint                                 it's a portrait of Edmund Bellamy was                                 generated by adversarial Network your                                 networks it's a machine line component                                 and it was sold in                                                      ok so the future is here thank you very                                 much for attention I mean questions in                                 the room thank you for the talk you                                 mentioned there's two methods the                                 traditional search and the new method or                                 test the new search and the new search                                 doesn't work in most of the cases or                                 some of the cases have you thought about                                 merging the two methods and using them                                 together in the same system that's our                                 next experiment yeah I know matter of                                 fact this parameter is a model that I                                 showed to you that's what we're gonna do                                 let him go that so we have carry he                                 writes here but a matter of fact I have                                 a scoring functions off acquired given a                                 product all right so I have a product in                                 a query I have a scoring function I                                 could use this modern approach so a deep                                 neural network to provide me a score and                                 I could learn some lambda value that                                 could trust or not trust depending on if                                 it's a top query if it's some query that                                 they could not answer another way so                                 yeah basically you could still using                                 this approach but I'm a person I believe                                 that is its it should be included this                                 desert texture more questions                                 so you have added first sanitation and                                 afterwards expansion which about two                                 expansions mostly string-based so said                                 any reasoning for doing it or is that                                 order not the other all around so your                                 questions about the he convinced though                                 which one sorry two more yeah this one                                 so here you have annotated query and                                 then afterwards to do the expansion but                                 you could also do it the other way                                 around because you're the annotation may                                 heavily depend on the type of engine yes                                 the current expansion sometimes it's mix                                 it then it's not wrong and right with                                 the retrieval part so if you tell me                                 that your query expansion is when you go                                 to retrieve the engine in retrieve                                 results you're right but in that case                                 please point this is a machine learning                                  module that's gonna tell me what kind of                                  different knowledge I'm gonna trying to                                  find the notated query to generate                                  multiple queries and that multiple                                  queries are going to change they're                                  going to be sent to the search engine                                  this step so here I'm just going to do                                  in query here phrasing your query query                                  here right that's the way I see more                                  questions                                  [Applause]                                  thanks for the interesting talk in the                                  first effort to build an end-to-end                                  model in that case was the model similar                                  to the combination of the later existing                                  models and in that case we're using                                  auxilary loss functions throughout to                                  sort of maintain a sort of sensible                                  output of each yeah we did some                                  experiences in triple loss function we                                  did those some experiments using other                                  loss functions and the problem that we                                  found in your case were first basic                                  scenario very specific data set is                                  convergence so we trained a lot and the                                  results were not converging with trying                                  to use other losses we try to use                                  composite losses and it's not fair as                                  well because we are a company and we                                  don't have unlimited time to explore the                                  problem let's say that what I would love                                  to have we needed sure just stop by to                                  your forms of exploration with that                                  initial results that we documented and                                  then we expected in the future to have a                                  better understand of this deep neural                                  networks approach and to continue that                                  project from that standpoint but yeah                                  there was a very different ways to                                  approach that and I could I could line                                  going details about what we did                                  [Applause]                                  okay yes in your talk you didn't mention                                  anything about like how will you                                  evaluate the relevance like in your                                  experience were using IR matrix like                                  precision at rate K mean average                                  precision but they helpful or you always                                  measured relevance by a/b testing like                                  there was no part about evaluation yeah                                  you're right I should have included                                  volition here it's a very important                                  thing because as you're dealing with                                  machine components you need to evaluate                                  in order to understand how close you are                                  of the best solution and but for                                  evaluation just to give you some big                                  picture we usually value a                                             and then you can do a procedural stand                                  precision of                                                            of your business                                  because I could have of course I need to                                  have a label data set it's very                                  important but that label data set as                                  human label it's it will not be your                                  whole data set will be static over time                                  so you have some difficulties of that                                  you could do a/b experimentation we                                  already do that if experiment it's a                                  good source to understand where your                                  methods are improve or not but your                                  evaluation is important to train your                                  methods so we use basically some                                  stuttered data set where a human                                  we don't use but the message that I want                                  to send is that the way to do that is                                  that we need to have a standard data set                                  with a human lay human rater checking                                  for a query a list of results which                                  results are more relevant than others                                  and lay being that lay beneath at okay                                  now we can do we can discuss that                                  offline we were five like I'll built                                  over time and there's a coffee break now                                  so I suggested anyone who wants to ask                                  more questions stays in the room and the                                  other ones go for coffee thank you very                                  much guys Thanks                                  [Applause]
