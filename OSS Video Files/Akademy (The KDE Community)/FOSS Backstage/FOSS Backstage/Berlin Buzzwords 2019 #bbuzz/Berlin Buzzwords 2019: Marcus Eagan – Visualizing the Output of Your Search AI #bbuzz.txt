Description: 
	If you have ever searched for “swimsuit" on an ecommerce store and were shown a row of snow boots as products that "customers frequently bought with,” you have witnessed one instance where AI will fail for a long time without  human guidance and intervention. Artificial Intelligence, without human oversight, will fail extraordinarily.

One problem with visualizing artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, is often the deep knowledge of mathematics needed to understand the language of its output. I will offer you a technical strategy and solution for visualizing your AI, outside of purely technical context, and in a way that is consumable by team members throughout the organization and quick to implement. 

Your business needs to deploy AI, or it will lag behind competition and lose market share until it dies. But your AI needs an audit trail. Through the use of open source visualization tools, you can transform complex mathematical data, like word vectors used in collaborative filtering for ecommerce, to ensure that your AI is one you can rely on and trust.

	                              okay hi everybody my name is Marcus Egan                               I work at                               works where I lead the developer                               relations we're working hard to bridge                               the gap between developers and Apache                               Solr Lucene spark and a host of other                               open source technologies as well as our                               proprietary offerings so that people                               know how to use them and can build upon                                them and extend them I'm hoping that my                                talk from today                                maybe introduces you to a new open                                source project and inspires you to to                                try out some of our prop some of our                                products and some of the open source                                tools that we use so you can build                                something better but so that everybody                                knows what we're going to discuss there                                it is how solar spark tensorflow                                and super set made me money and you know                                I'm not really much of a gambler I                                consider investing in the stock market                                you know much more risky than then say                                working at a loose it works for options                                you know like I just don't I'm not                                really big on gambling however here's                                why you should pay attention so I built                                a search app that used analyst data oh                                by the way feel free to take any                                pictures tweet out as much as you want                                to I don't care about any of this this                                is this was this was an experiment that                                I was willing to take to really force                                myself to be invested in this project so                                I built a search app that you'll see                                pretty shortly here that that helped me                                realize a                                                               of gambling which I was very nervous                                about and had a lot of anxiety because                                it's not my thing but the search app was                                to summarize it was powered by                                tensorflow it was it used convolutional                                neural networks to classify documents                                and an index pipeline so we were                                ingesting data and adding a field that                                was a predicted value and it the the                                interesting thing about it I'll get into                                later was this is sort of an                                introductory it's like the interesting                                thing about is like the the model that                                we built was not built for financial                                analyst sentiment gauge we didn't where                                that's outside of my realm of expertise                                it was it would have been very                                cumbersome and expensive and taken a                                long time so this is also maybe an                                introduction for some more exploration                                in the realm of transfer learning taking                                learnings from one domain or one                                exercise and applying them to another                                and and I think we had I think that was                                a big part of our success is because but                                I don't know anything about gambling or                                investing in stocks so this is what the                                so over the same period this is what the                                S&P                                                                   so they say like if you just invest in                                indexes more or less you'll beat you'll                                beat all the big name investors like                                index always wins or nine times out of                                ten it'll be and I say if you use                                tensorflow                                you'll beat the indexes so indexes beat                                the best investors tensorflow beats the                                indexes                                and for a little comparison that's but                                you know I don't want to spend too much                                time on that because it's not about the                                money for me it's about the community                                Deverell a loser works is a new area                                it's very challenging but I think it's                                sort of a testament to how much the                                company cares                                I run meetups all over the world I help                                people get started and help those me has                                become self-sustaining there's a few                                that I've worked on earlier in the year                                I'm gonna be working on six more and the                                second half of the year if anybody in                                here is once like have a meet-up in                                their city I don't care where you are                                just let me know I also am a contributor                                new contributor to solar also super set                                which you'll see here do a lot of                                different things for both of them some                                of them are long-term projects some of                                them are short and I've contributed to a                                lot of other projects in my life I'm                                also a long time open source hacker in                                 my hood so like trying to like steal my                                 parents Internet and give it to the                                 other people and also trying to do other                                 nefarious things from along you know                                 young age just curious but I'm based in                                 San Francisco that was in Detroit and                                 I'm willing like I said to help you kick                                 off a meet-up                                 now what I built which I'll show you in                                 just a second is transfer learning                                 powered navigation it's fast it so I                                 view search as the the future of                                 navigating an application you're not                                 going to there's not going to be a menu                                 box or like a hamburger in the corner                                 you click you're just going to tell the                                 application where you want to go what                                 information you need and that's why I                                 got into search and and I think you'll                                 see some of that just a moment I use                                 sentiment analysis tool that was trained                                 on unstructured data it was classified                                 by definition I'll talk about what that                                 means or about what that is here it's in                                 the same language and it's a similar                                 domain so there was some topical overlap                                 so we there's we have a data science                                 team and they spend a long time working                                 on e-commerce review data and that's a                                 good data set because well you know you                                 know the quality you can assess the                                 reliability of a review if it's verified                                 like someone actually purchased the item                                 they're reviewing there's still fake                                 reviews out there that are verified                                 purchases I found online but more or                                 less the verified purchaser bought the                                 product and wrote a review candidly also                                 they're classified with with some degree                                 of I mean it's it was some degree of                                 certainty so one and two you can assume                                 those are going to be negative reviews                                 one or two stars and form five stars you                                 can assume they're going to be good                                 reviews or good sentiments and so I                                 think that that that was a good a good                                 project for them and it turned out it                                 worked out for me I didn't I couldn't                                 predict it there was some topical                                 overlap and I noticed when I was                                 reviewing my data that a lot of the                                 stocks and liked a lot of the different                                 things that I purchased were on Amazon                                 they're sold on Amazon so I don't know                                 if that has anything to do with anything                                 but it's hard to dig in and one day I'll                                 know is we're doing more testing in my                                 time that I can and so let's let me show                                 you the app really quickly that's that's                                 a look at the app I'm actually going to                                 bring the app over and drive for you on                                 the screen but the way it works is it                                 will give you facets that will predict                                 the                                 the sentiment of analysts articles but I                                 want you to take a look at this list                                 right here in particular in particular                                 the second the second article on the                                 left from analyst reviews does anyone                                 have an idea what the sentiment is well                                 I'm lazy and sometimes when I'm going                                 through all these articles I've been                                 starting it up and loading it every day                                 more or less a lot of days checking to                                 see you know what's good and what's bad                                 and even today I looked at this why                                 beyond meat stock pop                                         immediately thought by cuz I oh it's                                 doing really well still well I've heard                                 it's doing really well because I've been                                 reading and if you look at the the text                                 below the body Texas like Wall Street                                 Journal is bullish on beyond meat but                                 it's got nothing to do with fundamentals                                 so typically that's a that is a bad sign                                 that there's something there's some                                 underlying issue so let me show you the                                 app in action                                 oh it's hard to work this and then so                                 see I had a lot of tabs but I'm Lily I'm                                 going to use these tabs this is this is                                 positive sentiment articles positive                                 positive sentiment classified articles                                 from our model so here walked out now                                 look but again really quickly let's see                                 here everyone here that has a computer                                 will be able to do this in just a moment                                 and it'll give you all your credentials                                 and everything in your own instance I'll                                 save it because I don't have I've never                                 worked on this so here you can see it's                                 a very simple app it's not too fancy it                                 was built we have like a you are a UI                                 framework that we used for building                                 search apps called twit kit and it has a                                 lot of features for fat for quickly                                 building you eyes and that I just use it                                 to build bare bones you guys like I I                                 don't even want any if I could just have                                 a search box and all the content surface                                 later that'd be better like I want the                                 first result to be the one I've been                                 looking for I don't want to go through                                 it so here you can kind of see how the                                 facets are applied if you apply you can                                 close that but just scrolling through                                 this I mean it's pretty peculiar let's                                 see if I do Lulu women so Lululemon oh                                 wow earlier today they were more                                 positive than they're negative now                                 they're negative more negative but just                                 barely so you have to kind of take all                                 of these results the grain of salt and                                 and read through the articles when you                                 can I don't know what they mean but                                 Apple overwhelmingly positive see if                                 there's another one no they're not even                                 in here anymore that's good so this is a                                 this app is only crawling the newer                                 articles I don't know if like the other                                 articles aren't in the same place but                                 they just don't end up in the index                                 typically and then so that's the app                                 it's it's pretty straightforward                                 the important thing is like all I'm                                 doing is I mean I'm searching and and                                 faceting on the tensorflow valley                                 tensorflow generated values so I'll talk                                 more about that so all the time I mean                                 the biggest thing for me is like I read                                 these articles myself and I get I get                                 them wrong all the time like I don't                                 know what it's saying and sentiment                                 analysis that's better                                 just like sentiment analysis has proven                                 to be more like I mean convolutional                                 neural networks have been have proven to                                 be effective at MRI reading more                                 effective at x-ray reading than than                                 radiologists or like among the most                                 trained most highly trained doctors and                                 I think there's hope that computers will                                 be better drivers soon and then humans                                 are slow they take breaks they need food                                 they're otherwise hangry this is why I                                 built it and so the other reasons or its                                 difficult to view scalloped predictions                                 at scale and we need a fast                                 visualization that was lighter and                                 cheaper than table low so you will get                                 to use that in just a moment does                                 anybody here familiar with the patchy                                 superset has anybody used to ever seen                                 it                                 anybody here but you are anybody here                                 familiar with Apache Solr I'm killing a                                 search conference but yeah tableau is                                 too expensive for me if and so if you                                 can add machine learning to an index                                 pipeline I think you need to have some                                 ability to see what's going on and then                                 here will justify a good time to invest                                 sign up for fusion instance in Google                                 Cloud just for simplicity and dealing                                 with solar spin up a super set service                                 on the same server it's going to start                                 on its own you don't have to do anything                                 and create a dashboard of the data                                 matching certain sequel queries against                                 your collection so you can see what this                                 what the smart index recommends so all                                 the there is a spark shell you can play                                 with in the in the instance so if you                                 want to SSH into your instance and play                                 on the spark shell with like one example                                 you're welcome to do that as well like                                 something that has nothing to do a                                 financial analyst so you can see how the                                 sentiment and analysis model functions                                 outside of there so if any if anybody                                 wants to is anybody want to actually go                                 to the lab I've heard that that                                 something like people do this and then                                 maybe one or two people actually go to                                 the lab but I can also just show you                                 what you would have to do and it's                                 pretty straightforward so if you want it                                 to see this so at the end I'm going to                                 show you I'm going to share what my big                                 winners were so you can know so if you                                 go to loose it works labs                                 it's not on here and you laughs                                 dashboard so you can even have to go                                 here when you have to create an account                                 and it's not like a spam or like email                                 marketing anything it's just we have to                                 be able to tie an individual to a server                                 because what if they do something bad                                 with it and we don't we have no ability                                 to you know stop them or prevent them                                 from more havoc but occasionally I reach                                 out if to see if any developers have                                 questions but that's it you would create                                 an instance in this case it's what I                                 call the financial Oracle's and so I'll                                 show you how it works here I'm sorry oh                                 it's not it's not on the screen thank                                 you                                 why is it I must have hit so you go                                 sorry about that                                 so you can see I want it to be full                                 screen so you can see everything so yeah                                 this is a temporary instance it only                                 lasts for                                                               few minutes ago I guess an hour ago or                                 less and it will tell you your                                 credentials and you can access the solar                                 admin UI if you're more familiar with                                 the solar admin UI gives you public IP                                 and a direct link to the app that we've                                 been discussing like the Search app so                                 there are a few people going through it                                 so I'll just wait briefly so if you just                                 as a reminder you can go to loose it                                 works comps last labs and then view the                                 the labs dashboard I'll go through that                                 one more time so people can see it                                 this works labs do labs dashboard                                 instances so is Eric Hatcher in here                                 so Eric co-founder loose' works he                                 worked a lot on on this project a lot on                                 the last project and advising me on this                                 project as well so he can probably                                 answer more questions but next day                                 that's probably not true but it sounds                                 good so yeah once you want once you                                 create once you authenticate and you                                 have a user these access attributes tell                                 you everywhere that you need to go the                                 for for the search app to access tensor                                 to access super set you need to take the                                 public IP which is right here and their                                 public IP and it's running I wrote a                                 start script just spin up a docker                                 container and the password for everyone                                 is admin super set and it you can load                                 it with with test data but I didn't load                                 it with any test data because I wanted                                 people to see how to connect to it and                                 see how they can use it for visualizing                                 visualizing search AI so once you once                                 you have your lab once you have your lab                                 start it you can click on the demo URL                                 if you click the direct link it'll take                                 you off of this page which is bad so I                                 think you want to click the first link                                 and it'll take you to a login and I                                 called it short search just because I                                 think it was most helpful for me                                 understanding what I should not invest                                 in or invest in options put options that                                 expect the stock to fail which are risky                                 and I'm not giving anybody financial                                 advice to be clear I'm just this is just                                 I tried it with this I don't know                                 anything about finance so and then you                                 also get a diffusion admin the diffusion                                 admin is the fusion admin is an                                 interface for for solar mostly for this                                 exercise but it's also the way we were                                 able to add tensor flow really easily to                                 our to search pipeline to an index                                 pipeline specifically so typically if                                 you see anything typically if you wanted                                 to add tensor flow to whether your                                 indexes index pipelines or query                                 pipelines you would need to train the                                 model and the traditional tool set tool                                 chain that you use like we used to put                                 our notebooks but that's just because                                 that's what we use in school you can                                 also just use the command line and then                                 protocol buffer is what you should use                                 to serve your serve your model up                                 because that's a pretty universal of                                 indirect Gnostic data interchange format                                 so if you if you're not familiar with                                 protocol buffers or how to how to use                                 them for serving your models you can                                 google it or send me an e-mail I'll                                 point you in the right direction and                                 then we're actually serving serving the                                 model with SPARC but we'll get into that                                 in just a minute                                 so once you log in let's see if you just                                 click on the password it'll copy also                                 once you log in you can I just thought                                 you saw the app but you should log into                                 diffusion you can see you'll see a                                 welcome Quick Start Guide that's not                                 really that useful for this talk you can                                 see in the query workbench the fields                                 that are present and in the crawling of                                 the Yahoo News app so these fields are I                                 mean these are all and the web page I                                 didn't define them and we map each field                                 to solar field so token and string and                                 then here this field was was added by me                                 the sentiment field and I'll show you                                 how I added that so you can see it's not                                 too complicated                                 so                                 so I'm not gonna wait for the fuel to                                 simulate results still show up yeah I                                 essentially I loaded my model which I                                 store in a zip so you have to if you're                                 serving up tensorflow models and spark                                 you have to bundle them right and so                                 here's the zip the bundled zip of the                                 tensorflow model and the input field in                                 my case is input field but that's it's                                 really important that the actual field                                 is the body of the article as uh I think                                 there's a body right here and so it's                                 best to copy an existing solar field to                                 another field if you're going to be                                 using it for learning just to isolate                                 like say you update a solar field but                                 you know you uh you update a model there                                 either way if you update a solar field                                 or model you want them to be loosely                                 coupled from each other just as a best                                 principle and in this case we're copying                                 if you do any manipulation to the body                                 like in your UI you don't want to do                                 that manipulation to what the models                                 being fed right so that's another reason                                 why and the part of the loose coupling                                 so this is just pure text we haven't                                 done any manipulation to it and then                                 we're predicting the sentiment and then                                 let's see here                                 I've already indexed the data for anyone                                 who's going through the lab so you can                                 sort of quickly get up and running now I                                 can show you how to connect to super set                                 connect your solar collection to super                                 Senate I encountered a lot of pain with                                 this but it's gotten better and I've                                 made a small contribution to make it                                 easier to and I'm going to expand on                                 that if it needs expanding upon but if                                 you go to sew on superset it's a pretty                                 simple user interface that's one of the                                 things I like about it and you just have                                 to add a database so I had a database                                 here the name of your database is the                                 name of your collection so I'm an active                                 step to actually doing this I think the                                 principles are just I mean they're the                                 most important you just need to specify                                 the name of the collection that you want                                 to expose and super set so in this case                                 it's Financial Oracle's and then there's                                 you have to use a sequel alchemy URI so                                 Solar sequel is super powerful fusion                                 sequel makes it easier to connect super                                 set but you can do this with solar                                 sequel if you have any questions you can                                 reach out and these other these other                                 fields aren't really needed to get up                                 and running immediately I mean expose                                 this DB in the sequel lab is probably                                 going to be interesting because you                                 could do some more explorations whether                                 I use in the UI                                 so let's see here to determine so in                                 this sequel alchemy URI this is tricky                                 it's not going to be the same for                                 everyone but if you are trying to                                 connect in a cloud environment you're                                 going to need to specify your internal                                 IP it because the external IP is on the                                 other side of a load balancer and the                                 Syst your systems have no idea about it                                 the ephemeral IP so let's see if I so to                                 find the new I to find the internal IP                                 the best thing I could come up with for                                 in time for this talk which is uh which                                 was to just specify pipe true the first                                 pipe true result and the counsel log is                                 where your internal IP is so by the way                                 in in labs you can always see                                 console.log just in case you want to                                 follow along and understand what's going                                 on so this is what this is also one of                                 my my favorite features of this app the                                 labs app is like you can actually see                                 what's going on and follow along if you                                 want to create recreate some of this in                                 your own environment and when you're                                 trying to do so hive colon sequel                                 alchemy URI string is pretty basic it's                                 the standard format and the password                                 which I got to go back and look at and                                 then                                 that's a good example so this what this                                 means is so there's there's two methods                                 for communicating and with hive and we                                 use transport I mean we use binary and                                 there's a few ways for authenticating                                 but I mean we could go down a rabbit                                 hole on authentication you can if you                                 need LDAP or or something else more                                 Enterprise friendly you all of the                                 authentication options are available to                                 you this is just about connecting to                                 Siebel so then jump right into adding                                 this                                 and the password is                                 well so this won't go long but if you                                 leave you'll miss out on what's the big                                 with the big winners are so ya know                                 perfect so I tried to connect to it                                 never works the first time for me for                                 some reason this time it worked the                                 first time so the format is just hive                                 admin hive : its last less and you can                                 see it above its a straightforward but                                 the important thing to remember is                                 internal IP if you're using our                                 environment and then you save that again                                 it's pretty simple and intuitive and                                 here to add to add tables so table here                                 is the financial Oracle's the schemas                                 default so if you don't specify schema                                 and solar sequel its default always and                                 then the table name I'll make the same                                 just to prevent any accidents so then we                                 get to creating a chart it's it's again                                 really simple and I think that you'll                                 find some use for this and we'll hop in                                 the spark shell as well so you can see                                 how I varies in terms of usability and                                 ease and like really getting your                                 company to invest and machine learning                                 there's like a lot of companies they                                 have maybe somebody's working on                                 something it's not in production or                                 there's not a lot of investment in it or                                 there's not a whole lot of confidence I                                 think the important thing about                                 something like this is it makes what                                 machine learning is doing for your                                 business really accessible and even                                 auditable so you can evaluate it you can                                 share these dashboards email because                                 people aren't going to dive in and try                                 to understand all the things that are                                 going on and happening behind the scenes                                 I think the dashboards give them a quick                                 entry into entry point into what's going                                 on so if we create a new chart                                 here this is all coming from solar and                                 from fusion and I guess the simplest                                 chart would be like you know is this a                                 good time to invest and so I mean                                 looking at my graph from earlier                                 probably thinking yes now there's no                                 we're not using any of the dates there                                 there are date/time fields in that index                                 that we have from the crawl Yahoo News                                 data but we're not using it because it's                                 not the article which is a shame it's                                 like when we fetched it and when it was                                 last modified which is like                                              so not really was last modified it and                                 then let's see here so the count is just                                 exactly what it sounds like and then                                 group by is when we get into picking the                                 prediction but I don't know if you saw                                 you can see all these fields to                                 understand which one and it's to                                 understand which ones are available and                                 here's how simple it is                                 BAM so overwhelmingly and it's changing                                 throughout the day so earlier this                                 morning I would say it was even more                                 overwhelmingly positive then the numbers                                 were lower but so you can see that's how                                 simple it was just to show you know                                 market sentiment in general and this is                                 what the analyst thing about the market                                 I don't know like how how much analysts                                 eye information maps to like the the                                 actual stock market but they all claim                                 that they have led to all of these these                                 successes so maybe that is a good place                                 to start and then to save it and add it                                 to a new dashboard you just save here                                 and add to a new dashboard and                                 like visualizing search predictions so                                 and it'll take you to the dashboard and                                 it's simple but you could stay there and                                 keep working and this is really easy you                                 can export the chart metadata force                                 freeze refresh the sequel lab lots of                                 usefulness and evaluating your index and                                 your queries or other information about                                 your search application if you store it                                 in a collection so now we can go deeper                                 and and and create a lot more                                 visualizations and I think I will but I                                 want to ensure that if there are any                                 questions about what's going on here so                                 far or like any curiosities or good                                 so that's a good question and I believe                                 that that's being discussed now just                                 joins in general and I have not I have                                 not attempted to to query to collections                                 I think the the issue might be the                                 connector between the I between sequel                                 and and supercell I think it should be                                 possible there's no limitation other                                 than the connector so let me check                                 actually I'll create another so I can                                 create another collection really quickly                                 and we can find out it'll take like                                 maybe less than a minute                                 I should take less than that Internet                                 and then I go to these horses index                                 workbench data sources no existing data                                 source so I can point to cnn.com so it's                                 a it's really interesting thought                                 because if you're trying to do like                                 investment analysis you probably want to                                 pull in data from more than one source                                 multiple collections in this case so                                 we'll limit the documents to five                                 and so here we have five documents now                                 I'm going to try I wanted to try to                                 query both collections and join them                                 very very good question                                 I've never tried to oh let's see tables                                 you know what I forgot the each                                 collection is treated as a database so                                 even though they're they sort of felt                                 more like a table let's see how this is                                 going to be interesting it may work I'm                                 not sure if it will but I don't see                                 where my connection string is although I                                 went to edit table it's a database edit                                 so I'll grab that and then create a new                                 database collection too                                 grab this password again                                 seems okay                                 now let's see if we can Oh                                 so if I let me make sure I exposed it                                 and I supposed to see DB in the sequel                                 lab suppose this DB in the sequel lab I                                 need to add a table just to be sure that                                 as a table collection to default again                                 like I said just to keep things simple                                 I'll name it collection to again did I                                 pick the wrong                                 just let me check maybe this is blocking                                 me before I can try it but I don't think                                 that's collection - oh you know what I                                 know what it is so I set up collection -                                 and I saw this these simulated results                                 but I hadn't actually indexed any data I                                 hadn't started to crawl so that's that's                                 what happens if there's no data in there                                 so I started to crawl there's now data                                 in there see what happens                                 come on it doesn't know that it exists                                 yet I even though it's there let's see                                 here so it's definitely there so let me                                 see I'm gonna pull up the solar you are                                 just to make sure everything I'm seeing                                 I can believe sometimes there's some lag                                 uh-oh                                      hmm                                 I always forget there's a too many                                 there's too many URLs in my head and I'm                                 almost not a better clock's ticking so                                 you know collection                                               financial Oracle's is here so should be                                 a table so let's see if I can default                                 collection                                   I don't know looks like it doesn't like                                 trying to connect to multiple databases                                 if they're in the same the same source                                 which would make sense because well if                                 they share a schema schema name I don't                                 know I have to dig in I'm gonna dig into                                 it there could be something else going                                 on mate like there's a few different                                 ways you can connect to super set or                                 Zeppelin using solar so I just have to                                 look into how I'm connecting if that's a                                 limitation that I've imposed by my own                                 choice of how to connect I'm using PI                                 hive but maybe there's a better way so                                 let's see here is there so I'm almost                                 against is there a do you have it                                 charge the adapter oh I have it it's                                 here but I think the presentation is                                 taking a lot of power                                 or if you have a European charger but                                 the a good thing about so I need to look                                 into that limitation because that's a                                 major one actually Thanks                                 perfect the big thing the great thing                                 about superset is it's super lightweight                                 and you can get started with it really                                 quickly let me see if I can add as a                                 table I'll try this I don't know what's                                 gonna if it's gonna work                                 yes so I think I bet it's the way I'm                                 connecting but the the thing that's                                 really good about superset is just that                                 it's a very lightweight and it's really                                 easy to use so in the companies that you                                 superset it's very popular like it has a                                 lot of adoption because it's not overly                                 complex like I think Zeppelin is great                                 for data scientists and engineers and                                 super set is really accessible I don't                                 know I mean I don't know if it has                                 enough features for all data scientists                                 but definitely some that it has the                                 sequel lab so has some interesting                                 type-ahead features and and query search                                 features that help you so look start                                 from like the I think that's really good                                 and you can share query copy to                                 clipboard this query history                                 lots of shortcuts throughout and it's                                 probably in your language is it in                                 German                                 I don't know people's language here is                                 German but it is in German any of any                                 other questions about it I can show you                                 some another visualization as well an                                 easy one or a heart a more complex one                                 if you want any any questions did you                                 did did you try to set up this in the                                 lab disease lab application did you have                                 any trouble it's really simple right so                                 I think you could probably take it but                                 further than than this I think that's                                 the goal and like if you encounter any                                 problems or you fix an issue with sequel                                 solar sequel open a JIRA issue and email                                 the mailing list and make a pull request                                 or on superset if you encounter                                 something I think you just open an issue                                 and they'll get on it as soon as they                                 can't the various people the community                                 and I think that's pretty much all I                                 want to share like I I think that this                                 is a very pro practical use of this                                 application but it's not the only use I                                 talked through these because I didn't                                 want to go through them but this is they                                 sent my slides I hate slides by the way                                 and these are so I just want to show you                                 because you stayed for the whole                                 demonstration which ones I picked                                 because of the financial Oracle's app                                 and that was how I made money I mean I                                 wasn't trying to make any money I used                                 the Robin Hood for it's like a mobile                                 app but I'm not big I had like $                                         there before I tried this and it worked                                 out so but there's a lot of                                 opportunities to work on all of these                                 projects definitely at loose it works                                 but I think at a lot of places because                                 open source is starting to see a lot of                                 support commercially from companies                                 they're making investments and it's                                 really good because I could not afford                                 Windows so I had to use Ubuntu and                                 that's how I got into it and it's just a                                 thank you and oh yeah there's a happy                                 hour salt and bone and I think Eric will                                 sign the leucine and action book he'll                                 sign autographs for anybody who's seen                                 in action and all these are all people                                 on the team that helped me there's                                 Richard he's over there and Grandma                                 Julian and so he had the happy hours I                                 saw him bone I think we're probably                                 going to just be talking about search                                 stuff and like building search                                 applications and trying to make solar                                 less hairy so                                 Harry felicitous Harry from me if
