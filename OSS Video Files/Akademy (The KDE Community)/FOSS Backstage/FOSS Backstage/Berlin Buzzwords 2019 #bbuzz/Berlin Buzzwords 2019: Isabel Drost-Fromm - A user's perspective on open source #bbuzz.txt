Description: 
	"We have won" - that's what I once heard about the trust that is being put into free and open source projects. Looking back at ten years of Berlin Buzzwords, it's hard to imagine how things could be any different: Projects developed at the Apache Software Foundation are basis on which tons of data analytics systems are built. 

But as a downstream user likely betting their core business on open source - how well do you understand how these projects are being governed, how direction is being set, how well they are equipped to survive the next decade? After all, there's more to open source than the source code itself.

The ASF provides a home to several hundred OSS projects - a lot of them relevant to the search, store, scale, stream ecosystem that Berlin Buzzwords targets. If you have been digging a bit deeper, you may have encountered the phrase “The Apache Way” - often used in relation to how projects at the ASF should work.

This talk tries to give a glimpse behind the scenes - with a strong focus on what the implications of best practices advertised at the ASF are for downstream users of it’s projects.

	                              good morning feels like ages ago is that                               I will standing ready no while standing                               now introducing a keynote speaker for                               pretty much ten years I've refused to                               give a talk right here because I've been                               part of the organizing team someone                               tricked me into standing up getting up                               early this morning so I'm gonna talk to                               you about open source essentially from a                                user's perspective for                                              spent time with open source communities                                mostly at the Apache ecosystem and what                                I've seen there is how these projects                                managed to build bridges bridges across                                time zones geographies countries but                                also organizations what I would like to                                explain to you is how to become a part                                of this community and how to draw your                                team into a bigger open-source ecosystem                                before I do that we've got a couple                                empty arrows here if you are in a                                Apaches of her foundation member can you                                please come up to me so

me if I'm telling                                thank you                                okay the entire slide tech isn't only                                born from my inspiration it's based on                                an Apache wait presentations that was                                given before by many other people many                                of C's mentioned up there thank you for                                the inspiration so for those of you who                                haven't heard about my name before                                I'm a open source strategist at over                                pace which is a company here in Berlin                                in the financial sector I'm also a                                member of the Apache Software Foundation                                I happen to be co-founder of this very                                conference which feels awkward to say                                right here essentially the idea was that                                I don't like flying in plane so much so                                I prefer to have you come here so that I                                can come to a conference was public                                transmitted transit or bicycle I'm also                                a co-founder of fuss backstage                                which deals with everything economics                                governance legal of open source projects                                going to happen again likely later this                                year talk to these people so what's my                                journey what's my user journey and open                                source my first email to any open source                                project that went out I believe in                                     maybe                                                              favorite search engine if you still find                                it I was still a very young student when                                I send it after that I joined a research                                group which was dealing with text mining                                with link mining here at HQ Berlin what                                I wanted to do was to analyze the web                                structure to figure out if web pages in                                the social media space which Bexon still                                were called web locks and not Facebook                                were differently linked between each                                others in the regular web for that I                                needed a search engine and a crawler                                that was Apache not about exon it was                                hosted on SourceForge while I was using                                not it moved from SourceForge to the                                incubator from the incubator to a                                top-level pops up                                of a patchy low seen every single time                                these moves happened my inbox got                                flooded again and I was like what are                                those people doing what helped so Vall                                said I joined Z's mailing lists I got my                                questions aren't answered I started                                answering questions of other people and                                I got valuable input while I got this                                input I also asked how to cite this                                project in a research publication one of                                the founders of self Apache notch came                                back to me and said to me hey this is                                how you can cite it and say hi to a year                                advisor because the founder of that                                project thought that I'm just a student                                same thing happened to me afterwards I                                was communicating with people at eye                                level mistaking many people in sea level                                positions in senior research positions                                it's just your neighbor from across the                                street                                luckily nobody ever took offense with me                                mistaking them for some same for some                                things that they were or not what                                happens when I left research was that a                                 state subscribed at some point grand                                 Ingersoll posted an email on Zilla seed                                 mailing list asking whether there should                                 be some Apache text mining project I'd                                 say I reached out he came back to me                                 that there's like five six people                                 interested in it half a year later                                 Apache mahute was born which was machine                                 learning classification clustering and                                 recommender systems at scale now tired                                 of flying to conferences those was a                                 conference that I created half a year                                 later someone made me a member of C                                 Foundation and I'm like what what                                 happened me                                 I believe this happened to a few other                                 people as well now it's true throughout                                 my entire time at Apache what I found                                 fascinating is the independence that                                 these projects have of single entities                                 there's always multiple people multiple                                 organizations involved that keeps your                                 project sattell alive and that something                                 said I'm looking                                 for when I'm looking at open-source                                 projects today now I want you to wake up                                 don't worry I'm not going to make anyone                                 else come to the front please raise your                                 hand if you run your systems

okay okay now I                                 really want to see hands how many of you                                 do contribute After Hours for any                                 definition of

            in a project then there are a few                                 questions that you want to answer before                                 building it a strong dependency on that                                 project you want to know how these                                 projects deal with security issues you                                 want to understand who is behind the                                 project and who's driving it you want to                                 know what happens if this entity fails                                 to continue say if this one company runs                                 out of funding or if this one person                                 runs out of funding you also want to                                 understand how project decisions are                                 being made                                 if CS like one person driving the                                 decision or if he can become part of                                 decision-making process and this is what                                 this talk essentially is all about how                                 do these projects run now you've heard                                 already is that my background is a                                 strong Apache background so this isn't                                 really a talk about and uses perspective                                 on open source in general but really on                                 the Apaches of your foundations version                                 of open source now what does it mean to                                 be to be open source if you tell or                                 Twitter is there's quite some discussion                                 going on about the term open source for                                 me personally it means it has to be a                                 and an open source initiative approved                                 license so said it's open source PI's                                 license but to me coming from Apache it                                 also means an open development process                                 that means open road map creation open                                 architecture architecture decisions plus                                 open design documents plus a process                                 where I can go and participate now who's                                 part of this community making these                                 decisions in my personal experience that                                 starts will see users so this was                                 everyone here in the room now                                 if you've been in the lysene community                                 for long enough and you've been digging                                 through the wiki for long enough uvula

                        and no backwards compatibility it's                                 better than no petted or referring back                                 to my first experience with Apache notch                                 of course I made some modifications                                 dealing was writable Bexon Enzi                                 so-called much disappeared file system                                 I never contributed it back I wanted to                                 have it perfect I wanted to have it                                 polished I want her to have it such that                                 it just works except it never went out                                 this is where I learned that it's better                                 to share your progress very early on                                 even if it feels awkward even the few                                 not confident with that people around                                 we'll help you get it freezer was your                                 first patch was it you will be counted                                 as a project contributor at Apache                                 mahute a friend of mine once told me                                 that in order to become a committer what                                 he did was to flop the project with                                 patches and worse contributions so that                                 over time committees were just like come                                 on I don't want to review yet another                                 patch give him right access and go ahead                                 if it's so for some projects that's the                                 same level actually being a committer                                 and a PMC member but what do you get if                                 he is the stick a lot stick around for                                 long enough you are the one who makes a                                 decision who else to pull in if you                                 again stick around for long enough do                                 something cross foundational people will                                 nominate you as a member of C Apaches of                                 the foundation if people come to me and                                 tell me hey I want to be a member what                                 should I do what I do                                 what I first asks them is do you really                                 want to be a member you get a read                                 another two mailing lists was high                                 traffic said really what you want so                                 what do you get to do as a member of                                 Chris you become part of that foundation                                 you may be elected as a board of                                 directors remember yet another mailing                                 list to read and follow plus you can                                 vote who becomes a director what's the                                 task of these directors wise                                 directorship between PMC and membership                                 sayers of ones providing oversight over                                 the projects what's this fuss is funny                                 foundation therefore it's fair to serve                                 see projects essentially providing                                 services like infrastructure press etc                                 through offices and committees however                                 everything all of that starts with a                                 users need turned into a contribution                                 now interestingly enough let's bake deep                                 into the history of the Apache                                 foundation actually I still bump                                 randomly into people like this weekend                                 for instance when going shopping who                                 talked to me like wait a minute you're                                 wearing your custom t-shirt what's your                                 relation to open-source and I'm like I'm                                 part of the Apache Software Foundation                                 and say go like yes this web server no                                 not really but still the history so see                                 where is this foundation comes from and                                 said they were a bunch of people relying                                 on a web server for production use                                 except such a person who wanted to                                 develop it at some point didn't have the                                 time and resources to do so anymore so                                 they banded together continuing the                                 development of a patchy web server what                                 do you see if you look at that it sets                                 those whole contribution saver and                                 altruistic at all Savior very                                 self-serving say headless web server and                                 protections they wanted it to be fast                                 performant secure so xavier making these                                 contributions not because they had a lot                                 of time left they didn't do so because                                 they wanted to make the world a better                                 place they wanted to get a job done in                                 order for that to work even then people                                 were coming from different organizations                                 what they built was what someone once                                 called Acey switzerland of open-source                                 what they mean with that is a neutral                                 place for people to collaborate they're                                 independently of you of affiliation                                 independently of your history you can                                 collaborate to bring your project                                 forward so how does it work let's get                                 some simple issues to get started start                                 with copyright patenting trademarks why                                 are the legal aspects important for                                 downstream uses think about projects                                 pulling in dependencies you want your                                 projects that you rely on to be clear of                                 any license and Frenchman's you want it                                 to be clean think about                                 contributions coming from corporations                                 you want to make sure that it's okay for                                 these people to make that contribution                                 think about patent issues what else is                                 there just trademark issues as a trade                                 down system use of what I wanted they                                 said if I'm downloading a duck it's                                 actually is the duck side I'm not                                 looking for so I want to make sure that                                 the project trademark is being used such                                 that it's not confusing for my                                 downstream uses but I also want to make                                 sure that my project name doesn't                                 infringe on existing project names                                 otherwise I'm going to have to rename                                 over and over and over and my user                                 doesn't know where the project went okay                                 so far four simple issues what about                                 slightly more messy complex issues                                 called project governance some things                                 that we do today and tomorrow here as                                 well                                 a purchases community over code                                 someone wants translated that as a                                 project without people is a dead project                                 or at least one that's very deep asleep                                 which kind of community are we talking                                 about everyone here in the room not only                                 commuters not only the ones sitting here                                 in the front row but like everyone here                                 where do we find you we find you on                                 social media we find you on sestok                                 overflow but don't be surprised of speak                                 people speak up and try to channel                                 discussions back to the official project                                 communication channels what are those                                 still mailing lists so you're still                                 higher bandwidth than what you get on                                 Twitter so don't be afraid to join an                                 official project channel to speak up                                 there to ask your questions here I still                                 remember that                                                        very awkward to me what happened was                                 that people were very friendly into                                 answering so often there's paid support                                 available from Zurich parties my                                 experience is that it's still helpful to                                 remain in the loop of C original                                 projects even if you won't get when two                                 specific questions answers there people                                 will be able to help you out with more                                 generic questions but more importantly                                 just from watching the discussions you                                 will see which issues people run into                                 and you will avoid running into the same                                 problems and avoid making the same                                 mistakes and trust me over time you                                 can't help but answer questions in there                                 and become involved now where does                                 communication happen direct                                 communication walks so this is a picture                                 taken at buildin buzzwords I don't know                                 it was a Tonya so maybe second or third                                 edition its high bandwidth use easy                                 phrases you see gestures being made                                 you typically realize when someone's                                 being sarcastic accepts that this kind                                 of communication doesn't scale as much                                 as I would like to have you everyone in                                 Berlin all of like every months and                                 every day in the year that won't happen                                 so we will have to rely on asynchronous                                 communication so there's a rule at                                 Apache which says if it didn't happen on                                 our mailing list it didn't happen does                                 that means that Berlin bus routes                                 doesn't happen                                 clearly not people are chatting here say                                 you're hacking here we've had hackathons                                 happen here for specific projects all                                 this rule says is that if you make an                                 important decision you have to take it                                 back to the mailing list because not                                 everyone can make the flight here and                                 King makes a time to be here so that                                 they can participate in the decision                                 making process now what do they mean was                                 mailing lists let's not see scary CC                                 lists that you have in some companies

                 stable what does it look like cs                                       lists years from death list all of that                                 is public like every decision                                 my personal checklist as a user but also                                 as a developer is documentation public                                 both developer documentation and user                                 documentation it's roadmap planning                                 public is serious some public a user                                 support our architecture decisions being                                 made in public now everything is public                                 everyone can get involved and everyone                                 has to be involved does it take ages not                                 quite so so for input so you you you can                                 make decisions by something called lazy                                 consensus and avoid tracking decisions                                 forever what that means as you say I'm                                 going to make change X within the next                                 two days unless someone speaks up you                                 wait                                                                    forward you don't have to wait for                                 explicit approval if you go to mailing                                 this you will see a plus one minus one                                 zero what have you so it's just people                                 voting on decisions sometimes explicitly                                 in a vote stripe sometimes even                                 implicitly people just posting plus one                                 minus one if you're interested you can                                 go to the Apache dog website there are                                 even clear rules on how to vote and                                 there are rules on vessel something is a                                 majority decision or if ser can be hard                                 weed vetoes now I told you that                                 everything is public right except when                                 it's not when a project is discussing                                 but whether Nick should get commit right                                 that's not gonna be public Google won't                                 be able to surface this discussion this                                 happens on the private list                                 what does private mean it's private to                                 see project                                 probably who else can see it directors                                 of the foundation can see it and members                                 of the foundation can see it it's like                                                                                                     that's something you should keep in mind                                 when posting something to your private                                 list something else those who do the                                 work are the ones who did take the                                 decisions it's kind of like a scratch                                 your own itch kind of thingy so if you                                 want to have something done it's better                                 to volunteer to help with getting it                                 done if you come to a project as someone                                 just requesting a new feature because                                 that's what you want people tend to ask                                 you can you help out taken to the                                 extreme before doing Berlin buzzwords                                 like oh my gosh that's                                                   was running a Hadoop meet up here in                                 Berlin like meetups goes everyone was                                 complaining like I felt like everyone                                 was complaining it's the wrong time at                                 the wrong place it's the wrong date ok                                 you complain here is a woman to be the                                 next first speaker and then you set the                                 date and time that's how I found                                 speakers ok what does that mean what are                                 those contributions just could be a                                 contribution what else doesn't have to                                 be code only it could be conference                                 organization could be meetup                                 organization could be helping the sea                                 keeping the issue tracker clean could be                                 user support could be press work could                                 be helping missive fixing security                                 issues everything that contributes to                                 the success of the project                                 so essentially contributions are more                                 than just so it's good what do you get                                 for a contribution I've learned that                                 chocolate works well for bribery some of                                 you I don't know if so neil is here but                                 some of you may have received droplet                                 from me in the past                                 I once was offered iTunes vouchers                                 except I don't use iTunes what works                                 better is a public qualified thank you                                 what do I mean biz public qualified                                 thank you qualified meaning thank you                                 for acts because it helped me do why                                 better because this isn't informing me                                 as a user how to continue and how to                                 help the project even further now for my                                 very first contribution that went out to                                 a JBoss project what I got was a                                 mentioned a thank you in the JIRA issue                                 in the commit in the release notes my                                 own resistors helpful I could take this                                 public thank you go to my manager and                                 tell him hey we made a contribution in                                 this being made public there he could                                 take that go back to his customers and                                 say hey we are very active in the open                                 source space and suddenly more people in                                 our company caught time to inclusive a                                 practical open source so this is the                                 reasoning behind giving a public thank                                 you what else works at least that's the                                 Apache Software Foundation is that                                 people will give you increased influence                                 and increased ownership remember paksy                                 project management committees those are                                 the people who decide who else to invite                                 as a committee this will typically                                 happen if you remain committed for long                                 enough now we've done a survey at Apache                                 on what does the apache way mean to you                                 and something some quotes that i like                                 was this one i hear very often that                                 contributing to open source is kind of a                                 de sharing is caring                                 now if you every remember houses web                                 server was built from people who had a                                 business case themselves it actually                                 boils down to get gaining by sharing it                                 means earning together across boundaries                                 across organizations to build something                                 that's bigger than anything that you                                 could have built on your own                                 if you stick around long enough that's                                 easy me standing here                                                    also means building an awesome network                                 of bill people across geographies across                                 organizations who meet not only at                                 conferences like here but also who                                 exchange technological patterns but also                                 like stories from from their work                                 experience so you get to benefit across                                 all of those communities you know it's a                                 funny thing is such as influences kind                                 of influence doesn't go away marry it                                 doesn't go away why is this important                                 clearly you can take a break that's what                                 I'm gonna do two days from now going on                                 a vacation for three weeks I'm gone I                                 can return all good what's more                                 important though if you are contributing                                 as part of your day job fixing problems                                 that you run into it's fine to be there                                 very active in January not be active in                                 February March April and some become                                 active and somewhere again even if you                                 switch jobs you're committed status goes                                 with you so if three years three years                                 ago I was very active I went to a job                                 where I cannot be so active anymore but                                 because it doesn't align those business                                 goals anymore I can switch jobs five                                 years later returned back to where I was                                 except the technology may have continued                                 and evolved but my status remains now                                 Apache talks a lot about volunteering                                 about things not being paid such does                                 that means that everyone is contributing                                 after hours we've seen their hands right                                 here in the beginning that's not true                                 while the Apache Software Foundation                                 itself doesn't pay for software                                 development that doesn't mean that these                                 open-source developers aren't being paid                                 they are paid by entities who are                                 interested in furthering the projects                                 that they have experience with so it                                 doesn't mean that all of these people                                 are behaving in an altruistic way what's                                 the ASF expects us that you act as an                                 individual is this easy                                 nope so let's take a little bit deeper                                 into why people are being paid to work                                 on open-source and maybe you can take                                 some of these reasons back to your own                                 manager in order to explain why you                                 should be the one to contribute back to

                            even before using any of the projects                                 that you will hear talks about today                                 today and tomorrow you want to

or against a                                 dependency you want to know how                                 decisions are being made you want to                                 know who owns the project you want to                                 know how trademark issues IP issues are                                 being dealt with you want to know how                                 security issues are being dealt with for                                 that in order to learn that you will                                 have to spend some time researching that                                 project once you've got it in                                 development or even in in production you                                 want to learn from the experts much like                                 I subscribe to energy development                                 mailing list back in the day you want to                                 subscribe to your favorite project as                                 well you want to want to learn from                                 these experts you want to learn also                                 from the users and wanna avoid making                                 the same mistakes you want to get in                                 touch with those who are actually                                 working on those projects that way you                                 can extend your team's knowledge beyond                                 your own organization and there is                                 something important you will learn not                                 only the technical skills over time you                                 will also gain leadership skills                                 leading discussions on these lists                                 getting people aligned behind one girl                                 now for every single opens those                                 projects that I fused in the bar in the                                 past there was always some things that                                 didn't sit quite right documentation may                                 have been wrong some implementation may                                 have been not quite right so it's very                                 quick said at some point you will start                                 working on a patch why should you                                 contribute this thing back you can keep                                 it in your organization you don't have                                 to polish it you don't have to make it                                 more reliable or more broadly applicable                                 what you gain by contributing it back is                                 a you don't have to pay the maintenance                                 cost                                 next time you upgrade your patch will                                 already be integrated and so's making                                 modifications will have to take it into                                 account when making refactorings but                                 also for one of my patches that I sent                                 to Apache Tomcat actually what I                                 received was valuable feedback on the                                 limitations of the changes that I had                                 made and how to make it better such that                                 it applies in a broader scope so some                                 things that I'm changed would have                                 broken in production except that see                                 actually developers helped me improve                                 the patch of course if you're on a                                 consultancy it also helps you gain in                                 street credibility so you pick                                 participate actively you help out you                                 are visible like was my first patch to                                 see Chavis project so you gain street                                 cred abilities that you can show others                                 Nena already talked about our sponsors                                 you get visibility and that helps with                                 employer branding and recruiting clearly                                 if you remain active at least at the                                 Apache space what you gain is influence                                 you can help navigate and skier steer                                 Razer ship is going but referring back                                 to the quote I gave earlier Bertie                                 gaining by sharing but open-source                                 enables huge get is to collaborate on a                                 project to grow beyond what you your you                                 on your own could achieve you work                                 together as Bo's friends and competitors                                 on a project to build something that                                 each single one player wouldn't be able                                 to create and with that you will                                 innovate much faster you will move much                                 faster but you will also build some                                 things that's sustainable on in the long                                 run so to some extent the communication                                 on the patch Sheila's has a bad                                 reputation for dragging for a long time                                 because it's very consensus driven but                                 pulling all of these people around one                                 table means that you have a sustainable                                 communities that can carry on over                                 decades why does it help us well to                                 contribute back it helps was pushing                                 open standards in order to if you help                                 improve the tool links that supports                                 those standards more people will be able                                 to adopt them of course it can also help                                 to further projects set serve as like                                 candy for users to use your offerings                                 now Apache remains the Switzerland of                                 open source the idea is that you                                 interact and participate as an                                 individual with so many people being                                 paid there's a lot of head switching                                 going on between being board member and                                 committer between being employee of                                 company acts and PMC member what helps                                 is if people make set hats wiki                                 switching explicit this is a little                                 anecdote again from a keynote here at                                 Berlin buzzwords it was about Hadoop see                                 her do pack ecosystem and about see                                 YouTube community the person was giving                                 really nice keynote about the current                                 state affairs and where things were                                 going accepts the audience was very                                 skeptical                                 turns out what's this person had done                                 was to use a slide deck from his company                                 he wasn't talking company issues at all                                 but people were skeptical because it                                 wasn't clear which hats this person was                                 wearing going forward this was being                                 made explicit at the beginning if the                                 person was speaking for company X or                                 force a project and this we helped very                                 much and made it very clear what message                                 people were expected to receive so                                 catchy doesn't pay for software

                              committed status with them if said                                 switch employers there's one warning so                                 make sure that you do not pay with your                                 physical health we did have a keynote                                 here a couple years ago and post                                 Bonhoeffer from someone talking about                                 seeing negative effects of being a                                 software engine                                 here make sure to watch out for

time and love into your                                 open sores there are some links oh you                                 can't see this judges these funny

                     that's very easy to say so you pave us                                 time and love except when you're not                                 what does the foundation pay for it pays                                 for infrastructure machines for people                                 working on infrastructure for press for                                 legal for travel

       want to support the foundation what's                                 interesting for me and someone who once                                 was a user now I'm a member of said                                 foundation so is that you are not alone                                 on that journey through its focus on                                 neutrality apache manages to build                                 bridges across organizations - it                                 manages to bring people together and                                 often the issues that projects are                                 facing today aren't new so there are                                 people around who know what to do or                                 what worked in the past you just have to                                 make them speak and speak in a way that                                 you understand it so there's a lot of                                 best practices related to project                                 governance currently the foundation is                                 working on making a clearer of rich                                 pieces of C governance structure based                                 on which experience so it's nice to work                                 together to meet in person we are going                                 to have an Apache con later this year in                                 I believe hosted right here just come                                 back here in couple months just many                                 other conferences that you can go to the                                 funny thing about Apache is that they                                 also have links to other open-source                                 communities think open JDK sync Debian                                 Zink Dockers Inc WCC                                                   serious experience was dealing with                                 poisonous people like if everything is                                 public sooner or later you will have                                 people that don't fit
