Title: #FOSSBack 17: Krzysztof Daniel - Beware of geeks bearing gifts
Publication date: 2017-11-28
Playlist: FOSS Backstage Micro-Summit 2017
Description: 
	Open source software is one of the most important inventions of modern world. Sometimes, we create open source software because we believe it makes better world, and that everyone should be able to inspect the code and improve it, a.k.a. contribute back. While this is a very noble goal, business does not care about 'nobility'. 

What business cares about, is money. Therefore, open source software is usually created because of more down-to-earth reasons, such as (the list is not complete) cutting costs, desperation or ... intention to destroy competition. The latter is particularly interesting, only a few companies in the world has learned how to exploit this mechanism properly. I will reveal how open source can be weaponised, and what does it mean for governance and financing.   

Chris has spent the last 12 years in a variety of business roles including compliance, software engineering, quality assurance and software development and thus has broad experience ranging from IT through legal issues to business strategy.  Almost all of that work was related to open-source software. He is a passionate problem solver whilst always keeping a firm eye on the big picture. Chris has a Masters in Computer Science from Poznan University of Technology.

presentations                               because you believe the right thing the                               best thing you could do for your product                               on the other hand if you are                               to stay with me we will look at the open                               source software from a completely                                different perspective from the                                perspective of value and money from the                                perspective where open source can show                                its architects there's only one problem                                with god human life because human mind                                is a pattern recognition occurs it can                                recognize what has been recognized just                                like in this case all of you can see an                                accessible and people face pretty much                                pretty good picture and in this in this                                presentation I will try to show a couple                                of interesting uses of open source I                                shall introduce you to the bill Corbett                                this is the main person on this picture                                I like this picture very much because                                photo rockers are pretty much like                                developers they are and they are trying                                to do they drop the best way they can                                and this one here was hanging around                                this racetrack to make a photo of his                                life instead of making a photo it might                                be became a subject of someone else for                                of Islam                                there hasn't been what can happen in                                their business therefore most of the                                business is done using this approach                                which is basically let's don't work the                                pills because fix the stubborn person                                other has been successful by bombarding                                is it is just good feeling min coping                                and little about understanding what's                                going what's going and I'm here to say                                doing the right thing with the right                                skills we are usually at the right time                                but we fail to perform because we don't                                really understand what is going around                                us some of you may say I'm exaggerating                                but the fact is that                                                   are projects                                [Music]                                have you maybe heard of an open local                                company that has created the one of the                                first iPhone Twitter's back in                                         not that you've been awesome                                one person did the the thing is they                                wanted to create an open hardware open                                software form that would be software                                developer friendly and they have focused                                so much on being open and being                                developer friendly the most important                                teacher comes out in                                             everyone knows that ordinary people need                                to have a shared concern even in setting                                up Wi-Fi network took an hour this is                                the DB embarrassed and setting up the                                phone a week or stop on the other hand                                the most basic functionality was totally                                broken                                there was no support for the end                                [Music]                                it kind of War I what right now I should                                give you the challenge if you were about                                to choose in                                                          you prepare a closed-source iPhone not                                not necessary station or the open mode                                of open hardware open some software                                phone which one would be your trust                                hands up who's for open and we just take                                this is not how consumers can vote and                                this is I think one of the most                                important parts in this presentation                                open source open source as such will not                                bring you any sales is not accessible                                just barely a secondary production first                                of all you have to have the primary                                functionality and then you can compete                                with with alternative solutions based                                using open source as your advantage the                                project the general                                [Music]                                [Music]                                [Music]                                if I'm interested in a cup of tea the                                step number two is to understand what do                                you need so it's a simple ask if you                                want to provide a cup of tea unique tea                                hot water in the cup if you need tea                                sorry if you need hot water you need                                some motor cutter and electricity and                                because                                 an open-source presentation we will                                 provide our own editor city and we have                                 some battery battery requires an admin                                 software this diagram is a simple value                                 chain diagram which can be quite                                 interesting especially if we add here                                 the visibility axis or value axis                                 because what's on the top is important                                 for the user now the thing is that money                                 flow from the top till down because the                                 user pays for our service the service                                 provider needs to pay for own components                                 and basically every component behaves                                 like a glass try to gather as much money                                 as possible kind of simplified but we'll                                 do what we'll do for now                                 this of course begs for question without                                 open source which doesn't exist in that                                 value chain at all will yet we'll get                                 there soon but first we need to                                 introduce the dose of evolution and have                                 you maybe noticed that some things get                                 popular we are very excited                                 this is exciting                                 it's like being excited it's not                                 computing power does the same way and I                                 would call this I mean I is not me but                                 this process is called I wanted to show                                 you babies something interesting do you                                 know what it is this is the first                                 digital Tamara created in                                                                                                                     know everyone everyone but of course                                 this process of evolution isn't a strike                                 over                                 and all those four faces are precisely                                 named and certain characteristics but                                 dependents that we can break our value                                 chain up the able access will rise                                 together much reaching geeky and a                                 number of different attributes you can                                 reassign components and what we get is a                                 world a map now we are getting let's                                 imagine for a second that we have a                                 battery provider company the company                                 provides the battery provider company                                 ships batteries and in addition to the                                 physical devices come software if you                                 are this if you run this company which                                 produce open source is that being broken                                 it's good there it's kind of a right                                 answer but the fact is that you should                                 compare the cost of open source software                                 and the cost of software and there are                                 four major attributes which matter which                                 is how much does it cost a license to                                 suffer the software to get the knowledge                                 and how much does it cost to exit from                                 the open source software and if we did                                 that we would have discovered that it is                                 actually important because                                        companies doesn't track the cost of                                 using open source software                                 bear in mind what I                                 just said thanks to some numbers that                                 believe that empty send a stretch with                                 means zero for Madrid of companies using                                 open source doesn't count which means                                 that for an architect or for any                                 developer the difference between open                                 source and closed source code is really                                 different winners or feeling a purchase                                 order and getting a license process in                                 weeks longer operation it means that the                                 primary advantage of open source is how                                 fast it spreads and some companies use                                 it on purpose we will get back to but                                 this is to show how this this chart                                 shows view how the open source adoption                                 effect how being oppressors affect the                                 market a product know as a compound also                                 the question                                 I'll say company providing batteries you                                 will prefer to start with the question                                 is about all the other costs                                 what about contributing but will you                                 contribute that you will in the                                 beginning when the software is unstable                                 because you don't want to maintain your                                 own software becomes more and more                                 venture you will develop and we will end                                 up with strategy of course this is a                                 software that should never be created as                                 an open-source software because it has                                 no business model and it's actually                                 using volunteers to survive volunteers                                 which are not paid work for the public                                 good which is so it is great for them                                 but from the business point of view if                                 something that shouldn't have happened                                 if you are in such a situation your only                                 bet is to find someone who cares                                 which is why is the company that                                 vanished from the probably asking reason                                 we get false of false run companies the                                 traveler necessary                                 the original original software now this                                 is a simple others now there are two                                 examples I can think of just out of the                                 top of my head                                 it's Symbian and it's Java for senior                                 Nokia failed to earn money on it for                                 Java not on the Sun failed to make money                                 above it but even work fail to make                                 enough money out of it                                 they have both open source the project                                 and now the step away                                 this tablet is happy for syndrome and                                 I'm waiting to happen for Java is the                                 developer we assigned the Java will                                 probably end up as a community                                 maintained as a community                                 without serious math like that and I                                 thought a company like record or maybe                                 IBM will contribute to darkness that is                                 never God now slightly different                                 situation if you would be a cloud                                 provider which one is would be more                                 important for you software regardless of                                 whether it is closed or open source                                 software or physical cloud computer                                 servers rooms                                 internet cables subtitles which after                                 you are a cloud provider this is the                                 service units yourself this is something                                 that people don't see in the first place                                 the answer is for you the most important                                 asset is the one the others can't                                 replicate right so if this will be open                                 source then the computing center is                                 important if this would have open source                                 competition the computing center is                                 important from the physical device and                                 this explains why you can see a sudden                                 change in the last couple of years here                                 limbs is doing great                                 Microsoft knows there is not a lot of                                 money in this pace of operating systems                                 and it knows that there is a lot of                                 money to be taken from building cloud                                 and computing centers so this is not                                 absolute well makers of north                                 and is doing everything to drive the                                 cloud adoption actually this wasn't                                 always there and the only possible                                 Charles because back in                                                 to create I think it is this product is                                 still alive which contains a                                 specification of how to be too late now                                 we are getting too bad we are getting                                 back to deliver value to the open source                                 this is a scenario very often played by                                 amazing                                 uses open approach releases its software                                 its game engine the overtime money will                                 flow to the cloud game engine the open                                 game anything will be the only                                 dominating engine in the world and                                 because of open source adoption                                 what doesn't leave risks plenty of dead                                 other commercial engines possibly with                                 their compounds and for amazing it's a                                 standard                                 it's a significant cloud users and if it                                 is a standard this business is protected                                 money are forming here a muzzle                                 and therefore it in sponsor and                                 standards in the change of mood of you                                 have learned but we have to preserve                                 compatibility this is a very nice                                 picture taken in Sweden I don't remember                                 when they have attempted to transition                                 from one Sunday at noon                                 it was a tale that took a number of                                 updates and this is the reason why if if                                 you manage to establish a standard in                                 open source open source that once this                                 become major people so who may be super                                 summarizes the three important aspects                                 successful                                 it's contributing to open source                                 increased adoption strength because                                 there now this scenario is repeatable                                 again about amazing or maybe Google what                                 will happen what will happen is there                                 will be new solutions based on the will                                 pick up the best candidate from                                 experimental soldiers we leave plenty of                                 that the purpose here but will be                                 so-called power because now making                                 customers from the core business will                                 require a new competitor to rebuild this                                 entire stock which is pretty much at                                 some point we will probably sooner that                                 government stepping                                 no similar scenario was attempted by                                 European Union they are allowed access                                 to bank accounts I know we are in                                 Germany and you're trying to use access                                 API not always exist the information the                                 problem is the plans don't own the whole                                 start so those parts will came up with                                 useful software aggregation of multiple                                 accounts delivering personal loans when                                 you need them will be able to easily                                 other box with quite interesting types                                 have made in every related to open                                 source besides that the open source                                 tundra is used as a way to easily under                                 linked providers once we do that you can                                 switch provide                                 now the thing is the signal of the                                 important thing I have to say about the                                 pan sauces that open-source Wars if you                                 know what you are doing the thing is                                 maybe you have open source can clear                                 competition in the case shown by Amazon                                 or it continued the Copperhead RS is a                                 form of Android slightly more secure                                 that was released in the beginning yes                                 under GPL so they made this business                                 model to deliver an open source secure                                 system more secure and stuff                                 great and people would pay us arises                                 what happened is the player competitor                                 started saying more seconds they did                                 they open sourcing so they went and                                 change the license to something less                                 permissive and now we can look at other                                 companies                                 the                                 hit by adversity                                 this is one of the biggest let's say                                 this is one of the thing that I would                                 like we've got to be better and this is                                 one of the reasons why now cut the                                 measures if you are using open source to                                 kill someone's business of course there                                 are counter measures is intellectual                                 property if you are as an open source                                 the other party can see you it doesn't                                 matter whether the loss with this letter                                 is justified or not what it matters the                                 device type I don't have to presume that                                 a couple of slides earlier we have seen                                 on the other hand so if you otherwise of                                 the other people are using the operating                                 system to craft products                                 it creates strategy of Commons it's not                                 really responsible maintenance it is                                 I do work for a leading edge forum and                                 my name is cisco Donna by the way I work                                 as a strategic concept                                 and if you are too lazy to with all the                                 blocks and ultimate realize that I have                                 the thoracic course I have a single and                                 with this call you will get
