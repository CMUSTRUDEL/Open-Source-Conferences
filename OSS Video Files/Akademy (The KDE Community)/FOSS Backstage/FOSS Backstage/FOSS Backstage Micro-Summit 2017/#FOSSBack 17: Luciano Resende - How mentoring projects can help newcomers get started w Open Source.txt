Publication date: 2017-11-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage Micro-Summit 2017
Description: 
	As adoption of Open Source code and development practices continues to gain momentum, more newcomers have become interested in getting involved and contributing to Open Source. However,  it's usually not easy for newcomers to start contributing to open source projects. This session will discuss how mentoring programs can ease the way for newcomers to get started with open source, and will discuss existing mentoring programs such as Google Summer of Code and our in-house Apache Mentoring Programme.

	                              I'm going to be talking a little bit                               about undeath which is a community                               development TMC why mentoring the                               available programs in how they they were                               kind of thing how you can go about                               finding mentors and help about finding                               project ideas contribute just to anyone                               here that has not been contributing to                               open source that is come to come nev are                                just getting started officers                                so what it today if we look at me                                everywhere I go and every type of                                project that I see open source is it's                                interesting if I'm building services and                                again from work talking about at fault                                it's very rarely to see a project                                started from scratch not utilizing                                officer so I can get involved                                we have to do today or tomorrow                                what is it beneficial to get involve it                                for individual I mean you learn new                                skills new technology you get all our                                visibility as well if you're looking on                                a proprietary software not going to the                                community you just have to really show                                people understand you when you start                                working on communities I think you're                                building more your visibility outside                                for everybody to see how you're                                performing to know your skills but you                                also contribute to the community                                beautiful project that you might be                                using internal usually people that come                                from the background are often using just                                like Burberry software they tend and I                                have seen all that they just like pork                                and make the fixes in China so if you                                familiar or if you know people directly                                that maybe try to tell them what is some                                of the benefits try to get there to come                                to the community providers patches make                                for the company is the same thank you                                you have the name of the company lots of                                people that are looking for jobs and                                things like that they will recognize                                companies that are working on open                                source they also get a competitive edge                                you're not getting a software like                                cricket who is working out                                it's basically tested and gone through                                use case or scenarios from different                                companies from all over the world which                                makes the quality and one of the things                                that we did remember when we had initial                                meeting I get back to home and we decide                                that we went over that the idea is we                                were so we were perpetually was a very                                successful foundation of projects and                                everything and why was that mostly                                around the way we do things what we call                                in a gradual way but also we really                                value community over code I mean having                                a piece of code that has no                                or whatever but like maintaining power                                might not be very good have a community                                that goes around and abandons the                                project I think it's very important                                because if I mean let's change the                                things that you're doing so like if one                                or two people that are contributing have                                to kind of like go away or step aside                                you still get that project continue                                you're still going to have life into the                                project so the the contact MC what                                because basically the idea to promote                                that get more community involvement get                                things you know in a way that benefits                                all the projects and in the central way                                instead of like each product trying to                                vote and do their community outrage that                                the Condor tries to centralize as we                                have people looking to the community                                basically if we wanna practice Emily the                                television for circuit community help                                others understand the Apache ways of how                                magic works                                if you offered us to contribute why do                                we need confidence to contribute                                why why people maybe kind of life yet                                afraid to come to software I mean I've                                been working on IBM for a very very long                                time and I still today talk with people                                that are doing very useful and new                                technologies inside IBM as proprietary                                software that when we start talking                                about open source and then you have to                                come to a mailing list to discuss ideas                                or or come and give it at all the things                                that they are doing so that people start                                 to know about the technology it can come                                 and contribute to your project they they                                 are really afraid of doing that they try                                 the software the software is good but I                                 think the community aspect it is really                                 is really complicated                                 so what I see when I talk to those folks                                 to visit Lee this is how they see open                                 source                                 it's like really scary thing for them                                 and then when I start talking with them                                 other things                                 they have to do that's how I see them                                 like very kind of my crying baby no I                                 want to do that come on and it's very                                 complicated and it's a very love these                                 questions when we do that for the first                                 time but then you start becoming a                                 mentor to them you start to tell them                                 like well maybe help this is how you do                                 things or maybe this is the benefits                                 that you can have and what start with                                 having that that thing that was really                                 scary                                 well it's kind of okay now and you start                                 seeing them getting a bit happier being                                 able to come go to the maining this                                 maybe they will send money per week but                                 you encourage them and you get them and                                 they will do all that collaboration on                                 the community they will start                                 understanding that they need to grow                                 their community and that's like some of                                 these things that the managers can bring                                 to the students or maybe they can and                                 they can bring to people that are                                 starting to get involved in open source                                 but I mean this is kind of like the                                 society from                                 and how major can help them but what                                 isn't that for the mentors the next to                                 his life that kind of like saw                                 presentations at which point did I think                                 a couple of months ago that conference                                 me in LA never happening and the idea is                                 I mean anyone knows the picture and who                                 is there he was there so this is                                 Socrates I think if you know the name I                                 mean now it's a very famous but starter                                 it is delivered that writing down and                                 doing any kind of like things around                                 things that he was doing it was really                                 detriment to the thoughts and the                                 constructive debate that he had so he                                 pretty much never write down anything                                 that he was doing and everything he was                                 fastened to recall to suppose or                                 nineties talks or from lectures in the                                 way that you become to know about him up                                 to today is from the work that all did                                 the South disciples the people that was                                 learning from him started writing down                                 and passing death to generation so I see                                 as a mentor also being able to pass his                                 legacy pass the things that he is doing                                 because community in Chania of                                 technologies to the other people within                                 that those and girls and girls and just                                 like some name so Socrates mental winter                                 plateau which they have been to very                                 spotless and you see they're about that                                 start coming and we know how them all up                                 to today so when we talk about mentoring                                 like what we should expect that if you                                 if you if you get a mentor what you can                                 expect from the matter so it's not that                                 the better is that I go and give you all                                 the technical details and those things                                 but there are metrics that are helping                                 you kind of like in the community                                 aspects not necessarily is the area of                                 expertise of his technical expertise so                                 you start getting help with things                                 around the project dynamics from that                                 words areas the needs improvement or                                 areas that kind of like needs to get                                 development order which is an                                 opportunity for you to start                                 contributing also I think a lot of                                 people that come and basically say well                                 this is not working                                 I mean there are ways that questions can                                 be asked where you will see these things                                 really weird get attention and you'll                                 see the the response is much faster and                                 I think what is in what does the maker                                 expect for I students I mean                                 particularly myself it is my own opinion                                 when I do mentoring I basically                                 unexpected okay I really like the most                                 not like paying it forward but but                                 really I get really bland event for                                 example I wasn't the last actually                                 members meeting and I was saying like                                 god that was being voted as a member and                                 he started working in Apache it google                                 Summer of Code as my kind of like                                 maintain those kind of things where you                                 see the guy speaking and now being a                                 member contributing to multiple projects                                 that those kind of things are really                                 rewarding for me so let's take a look at                                 for example some of the project if you                                 really to matter if you in ferment or                                 what are some of the programs that are                                 available that we participated Apache                                 welcome we are Apache                                 so we have google Summer of Code the                                 google Summer of Code basically runs                                 around summer vacation from the US and                                 is intended for college university                                 students you need to be                                             older and you need to be enrolled in a                                 university at the time that to enroll                                 into your into the product in terms of                                 some stats here in                                                                                                                             countries                                                              source organizations and about                                    percent of overall success of her and                                 the idea here is Google we will pay a                                 steep and to the student to get them to                                 know the community know how to work on                                 open source already kind of like in                                 their career or before even they started                                 working so that gave me guess familiar                                 opponents and something that just                                 usually it takes a little while to                                 happen but it was already a NASA there                                 is gonna be a                                      so if you guys are students or if you                                 guys know these students you can start                                 cooperating and try to get them involved                                 and the way the project's the the the                                 workflow to get accept that work and                                 this is coming to all of the I'm going                                 to talk about some gonna go a little bit                                 into details here of an exercise and                                 basically say the same way but their                                 projects let's say inside Apache they                                 will create ideas project ideas in JIRA                                 and tag them properly then at some point                                 the students come they will look into                                 those ideas they were looking to areas                                 that they want to contribute and then                                 provide a project or call so that then                                 get ranked it by the people with the                                 mentors and the administrators patricide                                 reach them based on all the slots that                                 Google gives to each of the organization                                 those will get basically fulfilled by                                 the students based on their mentor some                                 of the kind of like a tips for                                 succeeding at work oh I think in terms                                 of the project just as early as possible                                 start getting your project ideas out I                                 start with the proper label so that it                                 starts very visible to students and talk                                 about those are major of those                                 and elevation and profits that you guys                                 read to me I think for the students the                                 idea is too early on as early as                                 possible start coming to the project                                 know how the community works get into                                 contact with the possible mentor and                                 start trying to contribute this model                                 here the quality just get a feeling of                                 holidays that really count start getting                                 accepted that and being successful at                                 least on how we do it in the patchy here                                 are mostly references in in case you                                 want to get more information                                 google code-in it's a very similar                                 project                                 he basically it's for students between                                 the age                                                              schoolers and the tasks are not                                 necessarily a very deep code test we are                                 sometimes documentation and things like                                 that and I've seen that up at you have                                 participated in a couple of times in                                 this project similar acceptance workflow                                 similar kind of like a success tips or                                 for projects and students one of the                                 projects that are not necessarily                                 specific for students is the outreach e                                 is used to be called the average profit                                 firm                                 run by in you know and in                                              think they became more this kind of an                                 outreach project that is it kind of grow                                 more more generic and it basically is                                 for minority groups in terms of like                                 women african-american in those minority                                 groups of ten and this mostly becomes                                 kind of a leadership during the summer                                 time so a couple of more information                                 here if you interested getting into a                                 similar workflow basically think they'll                                 do a similar workflow in terms of                                 acceptance of these students the                                 outreach website if you guys wanna learn                                 a little bit more we also try to do                                 these in Apache we have a documented                                 process                                 this I think we we have done once and we                                 are might be doing it twice soon in the                                 idea is get some of the people that are                                 mentoring students are mentoring folks                                 and yet not necessarily my students but                                 people in the industry that are not so                                 familiar with open source to come and                                 contribute to a magic projects that get                                 from either with that I'm running I                                 suppose                                 pilot program with government in India a                                 few years ago and I think right now                                 there is discussion from a University of                                 Teague                                 there are interested of doing the others                                 of their students I might like I'm                                 following the thread they try to do that                                 for next year                                 and we talk a lot for mateys and then                                 with students and things like that there                                 is also like the time where what I'm                                 given a community upon your project and                                 the way to do that and I've actually is                                 through the imagine creator the idea is                                 like any project or phase that are                                 trying to enter the project needs to go                                 through incubation you need to get a                                 champion and at least three mentors to                                 help you navigate and understand the                                 Apache way into run releases                                 successfully we've all the legal things                                 properly done so this is more for the                                 mentor sites that are trying to look for                                 opportunities if we always need another                                 extra hand in the air Patrick debater so                                 if you guys are interested on that just                                 some of the restrictions you need to be                                 a member of the IMC and for actual                                 members can see email for those that                                 wanted together may want to be a painter                                 have have experience with let's say and                                 different qualities in the past but                                 another memory sometimes were primary                                 group there are gives you those guys as                                 part of the agency for finding mentors                                 usually you have a relationship know                                 someone but it's not there is this app                                 like for example if you want to know                                 someone that speaks your language is                                 close to you you can go to this                                 find local mentors oh sorry                                 and we're finding that selectively let                                 me go quickly on the next step so please                                 last finding product ideas that nature                                 so we can go and run a query in JIRA                                 with the text sometimes we used metric                                 for generic the ones and we have that                                 you saw like in a year for the ones that                                 they're doing there is also open hatch                                 that are more generic ideas for products                                 that are outside and I think one of the                                 things that I want to mention here is                                 like is not only about technology these                                 are just like could be examples of                                 people that are today like members of                                 the International Foundation are running                                 like all the ESS my                                 or like Sarah that it when become that                                 they all have mostly contributed around                                 community around the fermentation around                                 communications so it's not all about                                 hope it's about the community and the                                 value that you bring to the community so                                 you can come in contribute in much more                                 different ways to just bringing over so                                 what I want to share if you have                                 questions that might be on your back so                                 we can get me thank you very much
