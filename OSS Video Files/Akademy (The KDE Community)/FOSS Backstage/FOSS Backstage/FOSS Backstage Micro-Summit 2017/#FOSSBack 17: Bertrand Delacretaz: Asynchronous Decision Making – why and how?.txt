Title: #FOSSBack 17: Bertrand Delacretaz: Asynchronous Decision Making â€“ why and how?
Publication date: 2017-11-29
Playlist: FOSS Backstage Micro-Summit 2017
Description: 
	The Asynchronous Decision Making techniques commonly used in open source projects enable efficient remote collaboration, in teams which have no boss, no schedule and often no cultural consistency yet produce world-changing software. These very efficient collaboration techniques can even work without computers and apply to most types of projects, not just software development. This talk describes the key elements and tools of the Asynchronous Decision Making process, based on concrete examples from the Apache Software Foundation and from federated governments, which, interestingly, work in a similar way.
