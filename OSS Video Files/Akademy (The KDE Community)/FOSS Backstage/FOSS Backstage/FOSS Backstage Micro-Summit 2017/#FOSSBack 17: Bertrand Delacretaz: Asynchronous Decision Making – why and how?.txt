Title: #FOSSBack 17: Bertrand Delacretaz: Asynchronous Decision Making â€“ why and how?
Publication date: 2017-11-29
Playlist: FOSS Backstage Micro-Summit 2017
Description: 
	The Asynchronous Decision Making techniques commonly used in open source projects enable efficient remote collaboration, in teams which have no boss, no schedule and often no cultural consistency yet produce world-changing software. These very efficient collaboration techniques can even work without computers and apply to most types of projects, not just software development. This talk describes the key elements and tools of the Asynchronous Decision Making process, based on concrete examples from the Apache Software Foundation and from federated governments, which, interestingly, work in a similar way.

	                              so my talks about the secret                               decision-making                               I have not invented anything it's                               something that we'll be doing for ages                               just been reflecting on on what it is                               you know I think our produce many of our                               open source projects are extremely                               efficient we don't have any meetings                               we're working with people from different                                cultures different time zones different                                companies there is no boss and it works                                we you know many of our projects deliver                                world-changing software I would stay                                open is here from the a loop crowd I                                think we can rightly say that Hadouken                                industry but my name is before I wrap it                                up bonus points for pronouncing it right                                I work with Adobe in Basel we have an                                Adobe Applied Research Center I have a                                principal scientist meaning that state                                guide and also on the very active in the                                Apache Software Foundation since the                                early                                                                 the ninth                                so most on the technical side and also                                on the Border's general management of                                the foundations and I've been reflecting                                a lot on these topics                                how do those projects are efficient how                                can we replicate that                                business or other organizations of                                course we can make fast decisions but we                                have many factors to take into account                                so I think in our projects we do lots of                                decisions if you look back how you shape                                software how you agree agree in Apache                                projects can be sometimes a bit                                difficult so it'sit's all relates to                                making decisions getting consensus on                                the decisions that we make at the at                                Apache con Sevilla                                                  called I will not attend your meeting of                                noble sauce person it's a bit more                                provocative it's kind of the same topic                                you know how can work without having                                meetings this was done more from the                                provocative angle but it's the same the                                same thing we don't have big sponsors or                                very rarely just talking with Chris in                                Apache call the Apache conference I                                think all of us what would refer is the                                envoys conference it's just chatting                                these people in the hallways or at the                                bar or in the garden somewhere the talks                                are good but but it's things very often                                happen in the evening over this is                                another I wrote this blog post for we                                have series of blog posts called success                                at Apache on the Apache Software                                Foundation blog which traffic is pretty                                good and I wrote one of these posts on a                                sequence decision-making so it's the                                same thing as I'm telling you today with                                I'm booking to another one soon so this                                is the this is a gift of remote teams                                but especially remote software teams                                need to make lots of decisions all the                                time we are making decisions which have                                in fact the project to me to reel them                                we need to make the right decision and                                when we have options we need to agree on                                which option I would say that the Apache                                model works best for infrastructure                                software that doesn't have buttons if                                you have trying to agree on the color                                it's easier to agree on stuff that's it                                a structure because you have if you have                                a web server it's pretty obvious what it                                needs to do                                you might debate how do we do that that                                what it needs to be to serve web pages                                very efficiently yet if you look at the                                Apache web server the SBPD project it's                                extremely modular it's a pretty small                                core and everything else is modules my                                theory is that that's because people                                could not agree and and really                                modularity is a way to solve community                                problems if you cannot agree on                                something                                do modules and what you know maybe                                someone will use what money maybe                                you'll be both are happy and still                                sharing the very important call which is                                which is a key so I think one of the key                                of success in these projects is reducing                                the surface on which we are to agree and                                that's what microphones are so we have                                to be able is very equal to for the rest                                 it's not as important so the question is                                 how can that happen without meetings and                                 how can we keep the process efficient                                 and fun I think the fun factor is                                 extremely important and as well as in                                 business in companies if you if your                                 colleagues you are employees about                                 having fun when they have an opportunity                                 to leave there will need or you have to                                 pour lots of money on them which is                                 expensive so you know I think the fun is                                 important then we can keep this part but                                 by being active on both sides both the                                 tech side and the administrative side of                                 the Apache Software Foundation sometimes                                 it's hard to keep the fun when you when                                 you disagree about something important                                 it's all that we you should strive for                                 doing that we have a nice concept that                                 we mentioned sometimes alone is the                                 share neurons putting up neurons                                 together to do something great and so                                 what is a simple decision making that's                                 I haven't done I'm not the psychologist                                 haven't done very complicated studies                                 from at least so maybe some degree and                                 this is how I see decisions there are                                 four main phases first you need to                                 brainstorm                                 yeah you know need to have white dreams                                 or wild ideas or could we do this thing                                 you don't want to have any any                                 constraints then you will we find these                                 disparate slopes into actual options                                 what are the options at this point we                                 have to do a specific function in our                                 software we do it this way or did we use                                 maybe other software or we could do this                                 the other way and at this stage you                                 should try to keep you my donor so not                                 you know try not to be too biased say                                 okay what are the options maybe and                                 sometimes that happens when you're more                                 experienced enough others may be you                                 know that option sees that we're going                                 to take option C we still include it for                                 fairness with your colleagues to for you                                 know so they feel that something say and                                 even if you pretty sure later in the                                 consensus you would come up then you                                 need to be in the consensus that's the                                 third stage that's the one that is often                                 the hardest because you know what are                                 you doing the options there's no there's                                 not much at stake you someone said oh I                                 want to have these options okay yeah we                                 decide but once you have to do the                                 consensus that's when things can get                                 heated and we have mechanisms                                 and then the decision once you have the                                 consensus the decision is just                                 formalizing it so having a way to                                 document the decision so that next week                                 still valid or when someone usuals your                                 team even on that to that CEO this is                                 the decision that we made last month you                                 have the explanation and so so that I                                 think we really where it where it's                                 where there's work to do is that the                                 consensus rather something interesting                                 to note is that unless you have forward                                 reason to do to have people do that                                 none of this requires people to be in                                 the same place at the same time you know                                 consider a phone meeting the same place                                 now none of this needs to be synchronous                                 everything can happen at synchronously                                 if you have the right tools and that                                 that's that's what I'm what I'm trying                                 to do today in some cases like the like                                 the Apache board meeting the Apache                                 bylaws require us to make decisions in a                                 certain way that requires us to be on                                 the phone to have a vote on the phone or                                 maybe you maybe try to you know then                                 that debate that is required and also                                 speak a bit about the Swiss government                                 which in                                 city workers in a similar way and they                                 also have written requirements to be a                                 laborer or made a decision but in most                                 cases if itself if you creating soft                                 software nothing requires you formally                                 to be to be exactly so it can maybe                                 signals the tools the radio and a drawer                                 or output I'm trying to get out                                 not-not-not talk too much about software                                 tools because they can be sometimes it                                 people can be very often generated about                                 which tool you want to use and I want to                                 avoid this austerity at a higher level                                 so for me the two main tools that we                                 need to do that is a shared a                                 synchronous communications channel a                                 channel where everybody uses the same                                 channel to speak you talk to the project                                 instead of talking to specific people                                 and you have a way to share the channel                                 and to branch out into more specific                                 discussions at Apache we do that by                                 default with mailing lists which are                                 often considered as a node of the county                                 - today the young folks the thing is                                 that amazingness is very if it's used                                 with lots of discipline that's another                                 question but if you have the right                                 disappear on mailing list it you can                                 reach the people very efficiently and                                 you can have threads which I can totally                                 ignore if I'm not interested in this                                 specific discussion so it's easy to pay                                 attention to                                 to completely ignore the rest and I am                                 used to you know I've been doing that                                 for ten years now I can't follow many                                 discs which are                                                        not reading the                                                       reading in twenty ten of them and the                                 rest are skipped because of the because                                 of the subject line because of the                                 shredding so if you use it what it's the                                 same thing as if you do marine radio and                                 I have my sailing instructor in the room                                 immanuel immanuel ishani                                 on top of being a volunteer Apache is a                                 volunteer at late at night France which                                 is the best sailing school in France                                 what'd you do what'd you sailing on what                                 or when you when you you know driving a                                 ship you have a radio which has one                                 common challenge at sixteen is broadcast                                 channel                                 that's way cool for parabolic and then                                 we'll switch to a different channel to                                 for the rest of the conversation it's                                 exactly the same as to do on make with                                 you call for people on radius with a                                 good subject line but then whoever wants                                 to jump in the discussion can do that by                                 staying the same track all otherwise                                 we'll just be called complete discussion                                 based so this is the synchronous                                 communication channels and the other                                 thing that you need is a case traveling                                 to an Apache we often use JIRA or                                 tickets for that bit tickets already                                 popular simply something where you can                                 isolate the case on the web page for                                 example and then handle the case                                 completely this webpage it could be it                                 could be you know white board                                 if you're working if you if we were                                 working a synchronously using this rule                                 as over my Center we have a white board                                 where we would make decisions that's                                 totally totally viable the software we                                 usually use issue trackers or wiki's or                                 something like that so if you want in                                 this way to only meetings you have more                                 team with more time to think which is                                 very important and more precise if you                                 work in the foreign language or if you                                 shine if you have an in-person meeting                                 it's usually the loudmouth who get gets                                 the attention you know we have people                                 who are always talking they are good at                                 talking and they are good looking so                                 everybody listens to them and then the                                 poor guy is shy and you know or maybe                                 even just if you need a bit more time to                                 think you can you can miss you your turn                                 someone ask you a question and you have                                 this sweet person why don't we do if I                                 can't I checked I left and you still                                 thinking you know my to answer comes to                                 me and maybe it was better and in this                                 way you can take your time to think                                 Derk Derk from burek is a passive member                                 who is activity IETF you know big                                 standards organization he told me that                                 these guys did happy things they will                                 spend a weekend talking about new                                 standards they do not make the decisions                                 at the meeting on purpose they leave it                                 open                                 they go up to the option stage and then                                 they make the decision later unveiling                                 is pretty difficult actually just to                                 give also people you know if you English                                 is not you were your main language you                                 take any need more time maybe if so much                                 big spots with an accent you don't                                 understand so the you know there's ways                                 to couple that with singers meetings in                                 a very efficient way so there's                                 so I think we have we have defined what                                 it is - a bit about magic and let's talk                                 about why I already talked about my my                                 father was a carpenter we he had his                                 workshop on the basement and we had the                                 flat on the first floor and quite often                                 he was late for lunch and he excused                                 what they were brewing this you know                                 it's called gluing the piece of wood                                 that it's talking wound so if we would                                 have insisted on him being at noon shop                                 at home for lunch he wouldn't be the                                 less efficient we would have stopped the                                 flow to be started when you do software                                 it the same thing there's very good blog                                 post by Paul Graham you were here about                                 maker schedule versus manager schedule                                 if you manager and you you week is done                                 of meetings if you have one more meeting                                 say one hour                                 it's one folio of your week you know                                 it's just one more slot and that's it so                                 it's easy to accept anyone home eating                                 if you a software developer you probably                                 know what it needs you in the zone you                                 you start with something complex and it                                 is two hours uninterrupted otherwise if                                 you                                 so that's the lady scheduled someone who                                 works on break the schedule someone                                 who's creating things they need their                                 blocks of time are interrupted and                                 meetings are more expensive for those                                 people because the meeting can destroy                                 your flow session which was would                                 otherwise ask three hours so that's the                                 that's the the big difference                                 and then that's something you have to                                 explain to the managers you know tell                                 them okay you're inviting these five                                 liberals for your meeting think about it                                 think how much it can cost them actually                                 terms of energy flow cycles so meetings                                 are extremely expensive somewhat I was                                 reading a lot earlier today and the guy                                 said if you have to expense the cost of                                 you meeting every time people would                                 think you do a meeting and after that                                 you have to expect $                                                    have to think about that and people                                 should be very careful I'm well known in                                 my company for rejecting most meetings                                 after lecture you know being a principal                                 scientist that I have the luxury to be                                 able to say no called you for meeting                                 there's no agenda                                 to do if an I found no way to prepare                                 for a meeting usually I will just reject                                 it                                 sometimes there's good reasons but I                                 think would indicate and it's so easy to                                 for meeting to fail you know oh oh we                                 forgot to invite Bob we cannot make the                                 decision or to come or there's no people                                 there's meeting you know people think                                 that meeting will magically so things it                                 doesn't we don't understand what's being                                 said                                 people aren't you there very often                                 should organize it in a way that people                                 can come prepared there are many ways                                 for meetings to fail so I think meeting                                 up treasures I love me a lot high-energy                                 brainstorming vision meetings look a                                 fantastic weather if you can be with                                 people in room and and draw crazy ideas                                 that's so much more efficient people do                                 do that in person doing the status                                 meeting in person is a big waste of time                                 Jason fired from base now wrote a blog                                 post on it two weeks ago                                 you know status meeting you have one                                 person talking all your listening                                 probably                                             interested this better way of doing that                                 and we can release mechanisms we can we                                 can I think avoid any research okay so                                 we have talked about what it is why and                                 let's talk about how we do it                                 so let's let's dig a bit more into the                                 tools and I'll try to be more concrete                                 and talk about the tools that week we                                 use so typically I would say my favorite                                 way of organizing that working that's                                 that's how we try to do that's how our                                 egg you do that in rotating in my work                                 is to use mailing lists for the                                 discussions so that the shared channel                                 is making it it can also be a slack                                 channel slack is very popular these days                                 the problem is like that it's quite is                                 how to catch up if you were away                                 if you sometimes you have decisions that                                 take three months because they are                                 complex and you have to try things and                                 come back with the mailing list and an                                 archive it's also difficult it's                                 possible to really catch up and find the                                 thread and the interesting trend slack I                                 think or other channels I think even                                 lots of disability before we can                                 not so far but for me that the default                                 setup is a very least earlier for the                                 discussions and then an attractor my                                 favorite is a get get tickets I think                                 worked pretty well for for discussions                                 that lead to decisions they are concise                                 they delete people to quoting infinity                                 you know the worst maybe is the worst is                                 people using Outlook which prevents them                                 from doing same quoting then you get                                 messages that or you get shadow                                 discussions you don't know exactly what                                 the person is replying to and I need                                 tickets for that so for me that's the                                 good so in my case I would say share the                                 same communications channels the rating                                 is used with discipline because neither                                 and then the case where the tool is for                                 me is due to our audience and and what's                                 difficult is knowing when to switch from                                 one to the next                                 you know you start a discussion which                                 think will lead to a decision at some                                 point you have to you have to believe                                 the rainiest becomes too specific too                                 precise okay we have done with great                                 scoring option space we move now to the                                 year to the tracker to do the                                 formalizing clarification of the earth                                 of the decision so the brainstorming                                 definitely used this channel that's                                 where meetings can be extremely powerful                                 when it's going as                                 as I said in the same room or even with                                 the digital white we would be much more                                 efficient at spending time to discuss so                                 again maybe a combination of synchronous                                 and asynchronous depending on how you                                 can do it there the second phase is the                                 options it will often happen on the                                 ownership channel but then it's maybe                                 maybe at that point where it makes sense                                 to move to the case management tool to                                 the issue tracker to define clearly what                                 are the options that we have and maybe                                 have links to details to prototypes to                                 whatever and then you keep just the                                 skeleton the backbone of the decision in                                 the in the tracker then for the                                 consensus building it's also often a                                 combination of both if if the consensus                                 is very hard to to emerge you might need                                 lots of discussions and this might be                                 easier because it's unstructured                                 disruption it's really complicated                                 dd the history of the actual consensus                                 should be in the ticket because we want                                 to document that what also often happens                                 with decisions is that we have people                                 who come up later they come back from                                 vacation or they join the team later I'd                                 love to explain the decisions to them if                                 they can find the information here oh                                 you know only older on the basics of the                                 decision should be documented in the                                 ticket then we don't have to spend one                                 hour explaining them they can read and                                 get most of the information in                                 self-service then in my table I will                                 find questions that we can really find a                                 history of the decision and I think it                                 can be extremely valuable to keep the                                 trace of our                                 consensus so I would do also different                                 senses in the tractor except if it's                                 messy then it's five you are proceeding                                 in and then the decision itself is                                 either something that we see in many                                 incubating Apache project these are                                 people want to vote on everything they                                 say oh you know Apache plus what this                                 one you don't need to vote on everything                                 we do is to build consensus how you                                 build it does not matter if it the best                                 is what the consensus just emerges from                                 the discussion and it's not maybe you                                 have both or if it's a bit conflictual                                 then the world because if you see a                                 picture we have                                                        should be                                                            with reasons so maybe use your equity of                                 some people there's something to look at                                 sorry the Apache Kogi ghouls are very                                 good for creating consensus where it                                 doesn't emerge naturally we don't have                                 to use them is the consensus and of the                                 document                                 it's you know so that the history is as                                 is here for people who need them to look                                 at later and one thing again the                                 principles are not in software                                 development because project like that we                                 we do it in software because that's                                 where people work remotely or not but                                 you could totally use it so this is this                                 is my view and again the where where you                                 team needs to get used to doing this is                                 especially how to use the tools you know                                 the baton is aniket the disappeared                                 already using different channel                                 what's the discipline for your channel                                 while speaking about marine radio on the                                 marine radio you have very specific                                 rules twister so the the broadcast                                 channels are too busy and you move away                                 to different channel to talk and so on                                 so you need you need time for your team                                 to get used to that doesn't come                                 magically so and it's good to have                                 coaches or to have someone who's kind of                                 the shepherd of his process and then can                                 look at it and try to prove it as as you                                 go so the tools are this one thing is of                                 course it's mostly about building                                 consensus and that's where that's where                                 I come with my example from the Swiss                                 government and usually actually                                 just a little bit of it they use a                                 system to create the agenda agenda for                                 their weekly meetings and they talk                                 about it                                 they use colonists but what I                                 highlighted here this is a page from the                                 Swiss ball that describes how they make                                 decisions and they also say the Swiss                                 government so the Swiss born the sweet                                 zone is governed by a Council of seven                                 people they have to agree you know they                                 have to get consensus to make a decision                                 and they say it decides by consensus                                 whenever possible and sometimes also                                 possible so it's exactly the same thing                                 so we are sharing to see that even Tony                                 outside of the software world which also                                 work remotely you know use the same                                 principles and also this is important                                 we've also seen some some Apache                                 projects who are confused about that                                 consensus does not mean unanimity in our                                 context consensus it means widespread                                 agreement means you know most of us                                 breathe if you go to dinner tonight with                                 with France you might not have unanimity                                 on where to go but you see a majority                                 wants to go to this kind of place so                                 let's let's go there that's the same                                 same thing so that's where consensus is                                 best one that doesn't emerge then you                                 need ways to to build it and that's                                 where the Apache voting rules are very                                 useful and then they pretty well                                 that page you know the plus one minus                                 one is ease these things one also one                                 important thing in Apache is that the                                 Bettles there's a very restricted way to                                 use a vector we don't want weight                                 vectors in Apache in general because if                                 they took and are also want to block                                 something at some point it's better to                                 have a suboptimal decision that you have                                 no decision at all and we stopped so                                 that's why we were restricted on to wait                                 and okay let's I'm going to present what                                 we done with the theory and I'll show a                                 few examples of where where this is used                                 and you see that that people can use                                 very different tools but the basic                                 principles are the same                                 a very interesting example which is                                 informed but very useful as a Cordova                                 discuss it's just a git repository that                                 the the magical device project a whole                                 library and they have they have this kit                                 Ramsey free which is used to propose                                 projects proposed extensions or propose                                 new things both project they probably                                 you know they looked at the baby list                                 structure so what they did is that if                                 you want say for example you want to                                 create a version of cocoa before the                                 BlackBerry from                                                        go about doing that so you'd first the                                 stem root we have defined their their                                 own process you create a ticket so it                                 cannot do the opposite that I was                                 telling you that's why it's interesting                                 because it cost rewards if you want to                                 propose a new project you create the                                 ticket saying I would like to do that                                 when you think and then come the                                 dispersion in the ticket so the ticket                                 is your share chatter it's pretty nice                                 because you have you know you have one                                 ticket per discussion you know mix them                                 up as I said the get tickets need people                                 to do same coding                                 then the the basics of the ticket is to                                 decide whether we want to make that                                 project on so the first stage getting                                 your project accepted and then if it's                                 if people say okay we think we should do                                 that then we create a document lockdown                                 text file here in this regulatory which                                 describe what you want to do and then we                                 would we find it using the ticket to                                 comment on the refinements that we do                                 and then the the final decision would be                                 accepting this document as something                                 that we should've got a project that's                                 pretty cool it's pretty simple Expedia                                 isolated you could you could work on the                                 tickets that were interested and talk                                 ignore the rest which is very good so I                                 think that any good alternative to using                                 the many ways was something we need just                                 a bit more structure to make a first                                 decision to do the project a lot and                                 then many small decisions to refine                                 document inscribe the project                                 Tobias approach don't really think you                                 know this can work very very efficiently                                 so it's interesting here to see that the                                 total different the process is exactly                                 this is how we do it in the same project                                 so sling is a is a so work framework as                                 it's a small project but it's one where                                 an active spot                                 I know it well so we do it kind of the                                 opposite way as I was saying we use the                                 mailing list for brainstorming what you                                 want to do something we usually use the                                 mailing list to debug the options I                                 would say also it works here because                                 it's a freeze on project just maybe                                    to                                                                     then we usually we create ticket to this                                 priority over sadly that's where we get                                 the consensus maybe with additional                                 discussions on Amazing Race and then if                                 that works might have a vote                                 and then the final result is a is a                                 ticket in a tracker which is pretty key                                 doesn't have all the noise of the                                 discussions that we're here I usually                                 throw away also decision is made by                                 puppet on the detail and you try to have                                 the ticket that describes the gist of                                 the decision-making without all the                                 noise that goes wrong it is a lot of it                                 is about that you know separating the                                 noise from the actual consensus building                                 and this is also examples from                                 non-software the global fields on the                                 left is the Apache Board of Directors                                 which makes a lot of decisions every                                 month so the way the way the board works                                 the you know the core of the world work                                 or an important part of their maximum                                 work is to approve the reports of the                                 protests every Apache project has to do                                 a report every three months then board                                 us to decide to approve or maybe ask for                                 compliments or maybe a reject the river                                 and we do that completely separately we                                 approve about                                                         month in a meeting that has two hours at                                 most                                 and is not only about that so it's                                 pretty efficient we make like you know                                                                                                      people from different cultures the                                 native speakers who sort of like to ask                                 people to repeat and so on so it's not                                 capacity it's not a fantastically                                 efficient call that is sufficient for                                 two reasons first we use a back channel                                 during the call we have an IRC chat                                 channel fathers jobs and you know what                                 did he say                                 relations and so on and the other reason                                 why it's efficient is that everything is                                 prepared in a boss                                 we we have a very simple case management                                 system which is a single text file and                                 where we have one paragraph or one                                 section for each decision and then we                                 can put comments you know I put my                                 initials and I write a comment in this                                 file so just one finds it extremely                                 simple system but which has the                                 attributes of the case management system                                 every case is a few lines of text with a                                 definite structure and then you work it                                 out and we use the phone to take care of                                 the coordination so it works is very                                 simple but the key is that the meeting                                 is prepared there's lots of preparation                                 every one of us spends maybe one or two                                 hours preparing the rating our reading                                 the comments in advance is pre-planned                                 to them                                 so that we can solve as many or make as                                 many decisions before the meeting and                                 then in meeting we'll just have to                                 formalizing decisions we have a system                                 some Ruby with continued as president as                                 we're writing we'll see a tool for that                                 and then we can see the decisions out of                                 this text file with some simple policy                                 you see decisions are either green or                                 orange or red and it tells us if we                                 already agree of any discussions and so                                 on and interestingly the the Swiss                                 government works in the same way as were                                 saying this is also from the same page                                 whether present the way they work they                                 have they have very good lists for the                                 agenda but which are which are on                                 different colors so for example the                                 orange list is the item so on which they                                 agree so they know in advance that they                                 agree because there are some preparation                                 and then admitting they just need to                                 check formally they need to approve them                                 in the meeting that's a requirement of                                 their parliamentary process anybody go                                 very fast                                 I don't know I have not been in their                                 sessions you can do that if you know the                                 federal transfer but maybe they say                                 items                                                                    moving them then they have a different                                 the blue Beast has responses to                                 furniture requests so this might need a                                 bit more discussion before we can reach                                 this decision and the white list items                                 are this they say a discussion decided                                 one by one due to their political                                 importance you can read behind that that                                 is no consensus of these items so we                                 need in the meeting to build the                                 consensus the good thing is that if you                                 start with the easy ones you will have                                 mainly gone                                                            just                                                                  the most and the they take about                                       decisions each year and in a journey in                                 a weekly meeting which lasts a few hours                                 we certainly                                 there it's interesting to see that the                                 principles are similar and these are                                 these are these are synchronous meetings                                 so it's it's a hybrid combination of                                 preparing the meeting as if it was a                                 synchronous Oh everything you can do in                                 a synchronous way and then keep the                                 meeting just for the visit of the things                                 where it really makes sense to be                                 together because it's difficult because                                 it's more efficient because it's complex                                 and any brainstorming and so on and both                                 the Apache board and the Swiss                                 government work in the same ways you                                 know we sometimes even sometimes say                                 that the Apache Software Foundation is                                 the streets another food source this is                                 yeah it's interesting to see that they                                 can be different tools to implement the                                 same things it's just the concept and                                 here we see that the hybrid you know                                 between it's not because you have a                                 meeting in person that you don't have to                                 create prepare it and if you can throw                                 away half of the reactants before the                                 meeting is fantastic it saves time in                                 the meeting for the interesting that's                                 it                                 so we have seen                                                        share the secrets communications channel                                 I need a case when I have the tool which                                 can be as simple as our text file for                                 the actual code or oh my god if the                                 meeting happens in this room then we are                                 the four phases brainstorming options                                 consensus decision where you need to                                 adequately switch from one two to the                                 next based on which way you walk                                 and this is where you t buy into the                                 abuse to to doing that then yeah it's                                 requires practice and we need to adapt                                 it to your own culture there's no                                 one-size-fits-all I think what's                                 important is to focus on the basic                                 principles and then you can adapt up to                                 your own team again the goal is to keep                                 things efficient and fun you know if you                                 have as I was saying if you are meeting                                 while you're discussing big ideas it's                                 it's really fun it's really efficient                                 that's why it makes all the difference                                 to be able to gather the same room if                                 you own little conference to do boring                                 stuff it's boring                                 so we have to we have to be careful I                                 have a reading list I have a number of                                 articles a lot of maybe some of mine                                 that also links to other people's                                 articles in this on this URL and this is                                 something that I mean a solid is you're                                 defining more precisely the requirements                                 for the central signals channel because                                 never seen before I think slow slack is                                 very popular today I don't think it was                                 fantastically for for in this world and                                 I'm so I'm trying to define it more                                 precisely we have to say no if we have                                 this function then it would work for me                                 so for me the favorite to instilling                                 rainiest but as I said                                 yes require a lot of discipline to be                                 efficient and fun so if anyone is even                                 to look at me that's what I have                                 thank you for being here we attention                                 and I'm I'm open for questions will as                                 I'm standing between you                                 [Applause]
