Title: #FOSSBack 17: Sharan Foga - Open Source and Trusting the Water
Publication date: 2017-11-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage Micro-Summit 2017
Description: 
	Remember when you were learning to swim and it was hard to imagine that the water would ever support you? Even though you saw others swimming and the swimming teachers told you what to do? It seemed like an endless battle and for a while you just couldn't swim. No matter how hard you tried it just didn't work! 

Why? Because learning to swim involves having to let go of a part of yourself and your fears, and to have confidence that the water will support you. Being in open source is a bit like that. People have ideas and opinions about how it should be, talk about how it all works but to really be part of it you need to let go and “trust the water”. In this presentation Sharan talks about what it means to dive into open source, swim around and have confidence in your source community to help and support you.
