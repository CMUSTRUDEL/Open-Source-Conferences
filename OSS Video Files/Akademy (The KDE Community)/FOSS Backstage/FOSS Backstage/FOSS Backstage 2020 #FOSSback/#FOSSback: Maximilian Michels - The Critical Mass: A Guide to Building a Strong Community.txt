The community is the heart of every open-source project. Without a proper functioning community, the project is bound to have a heart attack, which could be the end: Think of unsatisfied users, project forks, maintainer burnouts, or very annoying arguments.

Building a community can be a daunting task but it doesn't have to be. All it takes is a critical mass of people who have a long-term interest in growing the community. Be it companies or individuals.

As it turns out, this group can systematically foster the community by building a framework for community interaction: writing down guidelines, helping users, onboarding new contributors, etc. The next step is to break out of the daily business through organizing conferences, meetups, or regular face-to-face meetings. Ultimately, the community is held together by relationships which are best strengthened via face time.

In the past years, I've seen two different communities grow: Apache Flink and Apache Beam. Both have found a way to grow their community. I'd like to present and analyze the paths they chose to build the strong communities they have today.

	                              all right so if you want to sit down you                               can do that but you can also just stand                               and drink coffee no worries so I'm just                               gonna start so hello everyone and                               welcome my name is Max and yeah first of                               all I'm really excited to be here today                               this is a great conference and thank you                               for the organizers for making it happen                               and thanks for having me so you came to                                my talk about building open source                                communities and I'm assuming you work                                with open source software in your                                company maybe also personally maybe                                you're building a business around open                                source and maybe you also don't work                                directly inside an open source community                                maybe your developer a strategist                                decision maker or your sort of owner of                                a project whatever that means we will                                see you later so the goal of this talk                                is to help all of you to better                                understand what makes an open source                                community evaluate different types of                                communities and well to eventually find                                out how to build those communities with                                building a community there's there also                                pitfalls and I'll try to point out some                                of those today and also I want to take                                at some of the examples of existing                                communities so contrary to its name                                which Matias also alluded to and the                                last session and open source is is not                                only about the source or the code it's                                of course about the people and the                                community is is made out of people and                                inherently also determines how the code                                develops so for example in a healthy and                                diverse community a constant flow and                                exchange of ideas would produce in my in                                my perception much better outcome and a                                project that is proprietary or has a                                disorganized community and the size of                                the community is is not very important                                of course                                what is what counts is the quality of                                the community the governance in the                                project is probably the most important                                factor for ensuring that the community                                works and it pretty much lays the                                foundation for all the processes that                                that have to occur in a project                                mediation of conflicts and also growth                                of the community and yeah communities do                                not just appear of course they are                                created and that and often very                                systematically so before we dive in a                                few words about myself my name is max                                I'm a software engineer and consultants                                for source technologies and I started                                using open source technologies around                                   years ago I think that's a long time but                                actually before that first did was just                                using open source technologies so I                                built my first network router at my                                parents home using using Linux and later                                I started using Firefox and Thunderbird                                in the early                                                            long time on my main computer for more                                than                                                                   I want to make now but I still use Linux                                every day in my work so I try to                                contribute as much back as I could but                                honestly I all I did in the beginning                                was reporting bugs and I didn't really                                work on in the community or in the                                software that much but it was later in                                my studies that I started working on an                                open source project as a developer and                                that was at a Research Institute and I                                was really fascinated by distributed                                systems at the time but our resource                                project didn't really have any users                                well actually we had some like companies                                using it because they found it on the                                internet and played around with it but                                we we didn't really bother with you know                                they open some issues on the Ariane we                                had our code and Google code and they                                made they open some issues and we were                                like this is too much work I mean we                                would just want to run our experiments                                and implement our                                algorism we don't want to want to bother                                with that and so but also I wondered at                                that time you know how does this open                                sauce sauce thing really work like how                                can you actually build a community that                                you know is more than just you know a                                bunch of nerds working on a project so                                 after I graduated I had the opportunity                                 to work in the company called data                                 artisans and it's now called America                                 it's a company here in Berlin and                                 they're actually we face the problem of                                 having a piece of software from research                                 that we wanted to build a community                                 around and we built it from the ground                                 up with like zero users so for me                                 personally I always realized that I was                                 I was really I love coding but I also                                 and and the process of problem solving                                 but I also cared about the community                                 because without the community there's                                 like no heart in a project and open                                 source just doesn't the project just                                 doesn't live and most of my experience                                 is with apache software but well we also                                 look at they're definitely also other                                 valid ways to approach open source                                 software and communities so I will also                                 consider those other approaches so you                                 you want to build a community right                                 maybe you're frustrated with your                                 existing community maybe you think you                                 can bet do better maybe you want to                                 convince somebody to open source a                                 product and believe that building a                                 community can be a really valuable thing                                 and let me get one thing straight of                                 course open source communities are are                                 not easy to build there's no like recipe                                 a definite recipe for building one                                 rather it takes a continuous effort to                                 build one and it doesn't happen                                 overnight                                 of course the effort might decline once                                 the community is more mature but you                                 have to you                                 have to invest in the community first to                                 get something back I think that's that's                                 a good attitude you have so the first                                 question you should ask yourself when                                 you want to engage with community you                                 want to build a community you should ask                                 yourself why why do you want to build a                                 community right because there are other                                 ways to spend your time you don't have                                 to you know indulge with communities but                                 I think a really good reason to do is is                                 to attract attention to your personal                                 self or your company that might seem                                 like a very selfish motive for doing                                 open source but it's actually like I                                 think many projects actually started                                 from that people wanting to get more                                 stars on github for example cross github                                 is not the only way to publish your                                 software but that's what a lot of people                                 use and yeah people just wanted to                                 establish themselves as as you know                                 leaders and attract attention similarly                                 also companies have been doing that for                                 a while now to build a product or an                                 ecosystem around an open-source product                                 and a community and companies who do                                 that usually benefit from this because                                 they have an easier time to recruit                                 people because they the open source                                 engagement gives them a better                                 reputation and also they might be able                                 to hire developers already familiar with                                 an open-source technology well another                                 reason why you want to do is of course                                 innovation and ideas due to the rapid                                 exchange of ideas you have you have a                                 much faster development cycle of                                 software usually and if you release                                 often you get feedback constantly so you                                 have this feedback loop going on which                                 can be really beneficial for source                                 software and one one and additional                                 reason is that you might also save costs                                 right because ideally if you have a                                 function community it basically works                                 for you I mean that is if it if it works                                 right so you only have to invest a small                                 portion in it if it's working too                                 get back a lot right but of course it's                                 a lot of work first another reason why                                 you mind two white want to build                                 open-source community is you your                                 forking existing project and to be                                 honest that's usually not a very good                                 idea because if you split communities                                 usually it causes some friction and only                                 one of the communities will survive but                                 and you also offend a lot of people                                 usually but they're examples where this                                 was really successful like in the case                                 for Hudson where you know son got bought                                 by Oracle and wanted to control Hudson                                 and it was forked into Jenkins and it                                 was better overall and do community                                 moved on so that's a good example for                                 example yeah and yeah another another                                 good reason I think is open source is                                 fun because you know exchanging ideas                                 making new connections just helping                                 people as it's a fun way to spend your                                 time I think so let's take a look at                                 what makes a good community I believe a                                 good community consists of of basically                                 four things so number one is is code and                                 you might ask yourself why is the                                 community about code right well you have                                 to understand that most of the times a                                 community is only there because of the                                 code and a community can only evolve                                 around a meaningful piece of software if                                 you don't have something exciting to                                 share and which doesn't provide value to                                 people then yeah how can you build a                                 community around this so you should                                 think about the existing open source                                 projects and and solutions and                                 communities and see how you can position                                 yourself there otherwise nobody will                                 care about your project also code is                                 important because it attracts a certain                                 type of community so how innovative how                                 easy to use your                                 where's and which programming language                                 you use plays a very big part in about                                 what community is going to build to                                 evolve around us so for example compare                                 a lisp project with a JavaScript project                                 compare like system software like a                                 database to a web framework or some you                                 know utility library the type of code                                 has a huge effect and you should ask                                 yourself how how much and how do how                                 much do I know the people who could be                                 joining my community so the second point                                 so first point is called second point is                                 people so that's something obvious right                                 the community is composed of people and                                 if you look at the definition for who's                                 like what people are part of a community                                 you usually find while they are users                                 developers and contributors that's right                                 you know from a very abstract point of                                 view but in reality things are let's say                                 much more complicated so the developers                                 they don't they don't go work directly                                 work for the community right instead                                 they they work at companies and those                                 companies have like corporate goals they                                 might you know shift from time to time                                 and you should acknowledge that and even                                 if you if they don't work at companies                                 they might do it in their free time or                                 volunteering and you should be aware of                                 this and and think about that when you                                 work with those people in the community                                 and for example it's usually not a good                                 idea to to rely on a single person to                                 maintain a project or a part of your                                 project because of that person's on                                 vacation or has a burn out which happens                                 or just doesn't want to work on the                                 project anymore then usually have a                                 problem in your community if you if                                 you're not prepared for that well not                                 and another aspect of people on the                                 project is that there are also decision                                 makers which which act behind the scenes                                 which often like vouch for your software                                 and your community in in                                 in a company or at conferences and you                                 if you know those people it's it's very                                 valuable for your community and you you                                 gain much more reach with your community                                 and generally recognizing that                                 contributions can be outside the                                 codomain I think is the key to growing a                                 diverse and powerful community and so if                                 you if you can cooperate with writers                                 bloggers enthusiasts                                 influences of some sort that's a great                                 way to to grow your community and you                                 should really be recognizing those                                 contributions also from outside people                                 that don't write directly work on the                                 code or like our mailing list so I think                                 to have a healthy community you really                                 need like a whole variety of roads like                                 of course you need programmers but you                                 also need architects reviewers leaders                                 organizers support has helped us and                                 moderators and all these roles can be of                                 course taken by by Pete like multiple                                 roles can be taken by by several people                                 and you don't need a person for each of                                 those roles but what's crucial to have                                 as many roles as possible so we had code                                 we had people and the third ingredient                                 is our processes so every community                                 obviously needs clearly defined                                 processes and probably the most                                 important aspect of our process is and                                 how do you contribute to the project how                                 do changes get reviewed and all even                                 more basic how do we communicate with                                 each other do we have a code of conduct                                 do we have a specific flow how                                 contributions are proposed and voted on                                 and connected to that is how do you earn                                 merits so if if you do contribute to                                 your project how do people recognize                                 your contributions is there some formal                                 that you receive or maybe there's not                                 even that that's a decision you have to                                 make as a community when when you build                                 a community hmm and yeah there also                                 other things like how often do we                                 release software how do we test and                                 document and also who has the final say                                 if if people cannot agree on on a                                 particularly subject so we have Co                                 people code and processes and the last                                 ingredient is are the tools and                                 infrastructure the tools that a project                                 use has has a large impact on how                                 communication works right so whether                                 whether use email or slack or forum like                                 just deciding on where where the source                                 of truth is can be very important and                                 also like who owns those tools and is                                 very important to make sure that the                                 project always functions and can't be                                 just overruled by a single person if if                                 that's the desire so I think a good                                 community is one that solves all these                                 problems and speaking of ownership of                                 infrastructure ownership in a project is                                 often associated with the license of the                                 code and Matias mentioned already that                                 you know software open source software                                 has you know different licensing models                                 there's you know the more permissive                                 license like the Apache License BSD MIT                                 there copyleft license like GPL Eclipse                                 license and their proprietary issuance                                 like open core whatever that means or                                 any and other custom licenses and of                                 course licenses are super important                                 because they set a legal framework and                                 also it determines like the mindset of                                 the people that are that one to                                 contribute because they might not be                                 comfortable with for example somebody                                 not contributing back if if you make                                 modifications ellos Mele or distribute                                 that modifications so they might you                                 know not like the apache license for                                 that reason                                 but yeah                                 in the end I mean if if you if you want                                 to engage in a community of course you                                 you have to contribute back upstream and                                 you should make that clear to everyone                                 who uses your software but that's                                 licenses are only one part of a                                 community and of ownership so I                                 mentioned also infrastructure is                                 important for the ownership and there's                                 also the the name or the trademark so if                                 if you want to insure a community can be                                 independent then you should also think                                 about who who owns the name of the                                 project because if you know the name                                 disappears it's it's harder for a                                 community to like the project can lose                                 relevance and harder for communities to                                 survive and yeah and the last aspect of                                 ownership is of course decision-making                                 and governance and there are different                                 types of models when it comes to that so                                 there's like simplifying very very much                                 there's basically the ownership model of                                 a single person or entity which is often                                 called Pannell event dictator model                                 which was pioneered by like lina                                 stalwarts and keto van Rossum and Linux                                 and Python and their advantages to this                                 model and there's a tight control and                                 narrow focus so you can you can say no                                 really easily which at which your                                 project and your community and which                                 helps to say it is to stay for your                                 project to stay simple but it might also                                 limit how your community can grow in the                                 end well for linux and python actually                                 both as models don't exist anymore                                 they're now also controlled by a board                                 or of you know some more                                 foundational model yeah so that's pretty                                 much the other model where foundation                                 owns well the the infrastructure and you                                 know the rights for for a project and                                 also its community and that's there that                                 we have the apache software nation the                                 pythons affiliation linux foundation                                 eclipse foundation and so on and all of                                 these have different bylaws of course in                                 my eyes the the ASF the apache software                                 nation is probably the most open in my                                 eyes but that's because i know it's a                                 bit best what is special there about the                                 patches of foundation is that to to to                                 gain influence there you you can only                                 you have to gain merit also so if you                                 contribute to the project you will you                                 will receive like respect and eventually                                 i get awarded committer ship or pmc role                                 and that's pretty much the only way to                                 do it other foundations like the linux                                 or python variation also have the same                                 model but they also allowed any                                 companies to to to donate and receive a                                 saying in for example the road map which                                 is a i mean it's a different model but                                 if you build a community you should                                 think about which model fits fits you                                 best                                 so that brings me to the critical mass i                                 believe that every community needs a                                 group of people which takes                                 responsibility for the project and I                                 call that the critical mass so what does                                 the critical mass do well it's it's it's                                 a self motivated group of people with a                                 long-term interest and this group builds                                 the structures and the foundation for                                 for the projects they are also promoting                                 the project and they are active in the                                 day-to-day business of the project so                                 ideally this critical mass is like a                                 very diverse group of people with                                 destroying interest different back row                                 different levels of experience and you                                 may ask can't just be done by community                                 managers and well not really I would say                                 I mean to agree of course community                                 managers are super important but the                                 power of the of a critical mass lies in                                 its diverse roles and experiences and                                 backgrounds so what would be a good                                 example of things that a critical mass                                 would do well it would take care of the                                 project foundation creating bylaws the                                 code of conduct it would in day-to-day                                 business foster open discussions answer                                 questions on the mailing list it would                                 ensure that the project stays relevant                                 with regards to technology because yeah                                 if a project comes obsolete obsolete                                 because of you know technical debt and                                 can't get up keep up with other projects                                 then also the community has a hard time                                 surviving and yeah it also would ensure                                 that you know the infrastructure was                                 correctly mediate conflict and it would                                 also ensure that it's a continuous flow                                 of new contributors joining the project                                 such that you know community always dies                                 when when other always always you know                                 grows when you know other people leave                                 the project and another part aspect of                                 the critical mass is to have an outreach                                 to organize conference and meet and                                 meetups write books or articles promote                                 on social media and just be really                                 excited about the project so how do you                                 find a critical mass right so I think                                 there's no definite answer for that but                                 um I would say it is a reflection of the                                 critical masses is a fraction of like                                 how how people interact and projects and                                 inside the community and I have a quote                                 here from young Lena which                                 she also here from Berlin is really                                 active in the couch to be a project for                                 a long time and he says on his blog I                                 try to be involved with every threat on                                 the manga list and showing exemplary                                 behavior being nice to people taking the                                 issue seriously and trying to be helpful                                 overall after well people stuck around                                 not only to answer to ask questions but                                 to help with answering as well and to my                                 complete delight they mimic my style I                                 think that's the way to go if you if you                                 are active in the community and you look                                 out for people and your you have showing                                 exemplary behavior you will find you                                 will automatically connect with other                                 people                                 and form this critical mass which is of                                 course a very fragile thing and it's                                 always a moving sort of a moving target                                 so I about you know what makes a                                 community what's all great about it but                                 you know maybe they're also things that                                 can go wrong right this is and an open                                 source the lack of funding or a                                 monetization can be huge threat to the                                 community I mean if you in your                                 community you should make sure you don't                                 directly depend on the project's success                                 or you have a plan B to make money and                                 otherwise so you should diversify also                                 your income to make sure and that yeah                                 you can meet community can survive for                                 instance when a classic example is when                                 when a company you know runs an open                                 source practice it it shifts its goal it                                 goes bankrupt then the project just                                 disappears and yeah you should encourage                                 actively to diversification in your                                 project otherwise your project might die                                 another thing is unsatisfied users and                                 contributors things might break and                                 don't get fixed and if you don't have                                 the right process in place                                 then you know bad documentation                                 complexity generally unfriendliness                                 tyrannous might just result in your                                 project to become obsolescence similarly                                 also if you are unfriendly to people or                                 you lack diversity that might you know                                 hurt your project also connected to that                                 is you know just people burning out if                                 the project scales because they can't                                 handle the stress that's huge                                 shoots threat to the community and yeah                                 so you should play fair and moderate                                 discussions and ensure that you know the                                 burden is not only on a few people on                                 the project so everybody give something                                 and receive something if you don't do                                 that your your project might get forked                                 it might just end up being dead and that                                 might damage your reputation as a                                 company or an hour person and result in                                 a lot of costs which you maybe not                                 obvious um                                 so perhaps before doing something that                                 could harm you maybe you should see a                                 talk on building a community first so I                                 want to conclude with looking at two                                 projects here one is called Apache beam                                 and patchy and the other one is called                                 Apache Frank they're both Apache                                 projects as you can see and I think                                 they're a great example of how to grow a                                 community although I want to hear matías                                 opinion maybe on this because definitely                                 these this project had a lot of let's                                 say investment the backing them so it                                 was maybe easier for them to grow                                 community but I believe the success of                                 this project for example flink is is                                 really due to the investment in the                                 community which is not something that                                 you can just do with money                                 so flink is a stream processing system                                 open source which definitely has a                                 really innovative technology which                                 helped it to also grow a community                                 around it but I was working in this                                 company here in Berlin which helped to                                 grow the community and I think what we                                 did there was really we stopped                                 communicating in the company internally                                 about what how we would develop the                                 software instead we would do all our                                 communication on the mailing list we                                 would share design documents online                                 start discussions we would we understood                                 that it would you know just harm the                                 community if we communicate communicated                                 secretly and of course maybe that's not                                 possible with all regards of your                                 company's business but we pretty much                                 shared everything and also we organized                                 meetups and a conference called fling                                 forward from                                                         build a community it the community                                 expanded like so much it went into China                                 and in                                                              conferences with like thousands of                                 people bigger than in Europe or the US                                 and yeah I think that's just a great                                 example of how to grow community another                                 project that I worked in was Apache beam                                 and it's also a good example how joining                                 a foundation the Apache Software                                 Foundation can really help a project                                 because it was a sort of a github                                 repository in the beginning Google                                 Google open sourced it but you know                                 there was no not even clear contribution                                 guidelines there was not really much                                 going on with the project so what Google                                 did is they donated it to the Apache                                 Software Foundation and they they Google                                 and also the rest of community which                                 developed really made sure that you know                                 it had really clear contribution                                 guidelines and actually we grew the                                 community there because we are actively                                 observed everyone who was involved with                                 the project everyone who posted the                                 email                                 contribute on github we took note of                                 that of that person and we encouraged                                 them through emails and interaction to                                 stay involved with our projects and that                                 that way we were able to grow the                                 community every month by several I don't                                 know the exact numbers but we all like I                                 would say we had we added like a                                 committer like at least every month and                                 [Music]                                 yeah and and also we explicitly                                 acknowledged that non-code contribution                                 would be also OK for committee ships                                 ships which i think at that time was                                 still a new idea and some people were a                                 bit opposed a bit about it in the                                 beginning yeah also we organize                                 conferences and meetups which yeah                                 especially conference we only started                                 recently but that also helped to grow                                 the community so to conclude building                                 and fostering a community is definitely                                 not an easy task and it can take years                                 to build a healthy community there is no                                 easy way I think that's clear but to                                 give I wanted to you know state four                                 things in the end to sort of summarize                                 this so I think the four axioms I don't                                 know for a strong community are yeah if                                 you could communicate openly to share                                 your intentions to make sure that                                 nothing is you know happening behind the                                 scenes and everything that is happening                                 a project should be documented every                                 process how to do things should have a                                 clear place so that somebody who joins                                 it has an easy time to figure out things                                 then another point is innovation is                                 super-important I think if you don't                                 think about how you your software can                                 innovate and adapt to well the market                                 and also people's need                                 then I think you're doing it wrong and                                 you yeah your community will not last                                 very long and yeah I mentioned                                 recruiting like looking out for new                                 people that's super important because                                 you never know how long somebody sticks                                 around because of you know things that                                 change in life and or you know maybe                                 that person doesn't want to work on the                                 project anymore because it's just fed up                                 you know changing jobs is to see so you                                 should you should make sure that you                                 keep a healthy line of new people always                                 in place and yeah and then also of                                 course foster relationships via kind                                 communication code of conduct                                 conferences meetups on that's the only                                 way to you know keep like bring people                                 together and more closely so with a                                 critical mass you can build a foundation                                 for your community and yeah the critical                                 mass might be really small to begin with                                 but keep an eye on new members and                                 remember that relationships are at the                                 core of a strong community so with that                                 I want to complete conclude thank you                                 very much for listening                                 [Music]                                 [Applause]                                 UMAX for that great talk does anyone                                 have any questions we have one here                                 [Music]                                 thanks for the talk                                 my question is if a project starts                                 within a company and first the company                                 is just using it internally and now                                 you're considering to make it public                                 open sources like can you test the                                 waters like can I even gain critical                                 mass outside of my company before you do                                 it because otherwise you just have                                 another potentially dead project out                                 there that's not an easy question I                                 think yes you can you can test you can                                 test how you know the potential that                                 your open source project you know has                                 for in terms of building a community                                 because I mean chances are if you if you                                 think about all these things that I've                                 pointed out and you you really shift                                 your focus from development inside to                                 being very open transparently and you                                 you build something that people you know                                 actually need not something as just some                                 old piece of software that you don't                                 want to maintain anymore I think then                                 you're pretty much guaranteed that there                                 will be a community around us but of                                 course you know yeah there's no                                 guarantee for it and you it might take a                                 while to pick up what I think one thing                                 that you probably can do is you know                                 just promote that project reach out to                                 customers or people already involved                                 with your existing with the solution                                 that you might be providing to people                                 and encourage them to take a look at the                                 project and point out to them that they                                 might benefit also from engaging in the                                 community                                 [Music]                                 any more questions thanks for your talks                                 very interesting learned a lot                                 I'm Benedict I'm actually an account                                 economist so this is quite new to me but                                 very very good to know I'd like to start                                 with a question and then a bunch of                                 comments so yeah I'm interested in this                                 because open source becomes also very                                 relevant in hardware and we we see is so                                 it becomes more powerful and what we see                                 is that it's mostly free market dynamics                                 I would say so my I'm really interested                                 in how the state can kind of regulate it                                 not by law but how can you actively                                 engage in open source communities and                                 thereby maybe ensure that what happens                                 is kind of within democratic values so                                 my question would be do you have any                                 examples of state actors engaging in                                 open source communities and then yeah                                 maybe I stopped here                                 yeah that's that's an interesting                                 question I think that is sort of related                                 to Matias talk as well how you know how                                 an open source so I understand correctly                                 you're saying how should an open source                                 project act towards you know government                                 actors right who who are active in the                                 community                                 oh I think well I mean that's happening                                 already I mean in Germany there are fans                                 who you know research projects and funds                                 that you know directly benefit open                                 source technologies and or even like                                 build no new yorking source technologies                                 of course how much the community is part                                 of that process I am not exactly one of                                 us in sure because sometimes it's only                                 you know about building something that                                 is open source and you know rest doesn't                                 matter in terms of fulfilling the                                 research contract there but yeah                                 actually to answer your question about                                 actors state actress and open source we                                 actually had you know in in Apache Fling                                 we had an interesting case for example                                 because it's it's a streaming technology                                 for big data or you know data in general                                 so we had actually also somebody who you                                 know had really did great contributions                                 in the project template code and                                 community but we found out you know or                                 we weren't really sure you know we                                 didn't want to ask like where this                                 person actually work and it turned out                                 probably that person was actually                                 working for the NSA which kind of let us                                 question like is that you know okay use                                 of our software do we you want do we                                 want to support that how do we you know                                 how do we engage with that person if we                                 know that and I personally think that                                 you should probably decouple that from I                                 mean it's hard but I mean if you if you                                 if you keep ask if you asked you know                                 what why are you doing this why are you                                 contributing this you can always you                                 know go deeper and question the motives                                 for a person to engage in a community                                 but I think you as a community you gain                                 more if you don't ask this question but                                 you don't you only see you know what                                 that person is doing good for the for                                 the project and I think                                 and I think also that is goes                                 interaction of what Matthias said maybe                                 disagrees I don't know and yeah asking                                 that you know you know asking where it                                 you know what other motifs is is usually                                 not the most helpful question but of                                 course if that person was to you know                                 act in a non friendly way or would you                                 harm                                 you know actively the project and you                                 would have to do something against that                                 speak out of course I which doesn't mean                                 like for example I would incur to size                                 the NSA or so but I mean you know that's                                 two different things                                 you know what my political opinion is                                 and you know what is good for a                                 community I believe just as a very small                                 addition you can you can check join up                                 which is a European from the European                                 Commission website where they publish                                 case studies of government involvement                                 in free software projects there is also                                 the sharing and reuse award from the                                 European Commission where they give                                 awards to public administration who                                 actively start own projects and put it                                 under free software licenses and the                                 other question was also the like                                 involvement in foundations flow yarn                                 over there there was also public                                 administration involved in the document                                 foundation projects there so that that's                                 happening a lot and those resources is                                 something good to look at and there's a                                 small advertisement we also have a Pro                                 sure with examples of government usage                                 of free software it's a public money                                 public code on public code you you can                                 order the brochure or say I have a look                                 at the PDF version there and there are                                 also some examples in there and another                                 just two other cases I wanted to point                                 out so with the NSA there was recently a                                 CVE                                 they announced right so they're actively                                 part of the community in a sense when                                 they do something like that but                                 obviously they they did that because                                 their systems were at risk probably the                                 other thing is in Italy there's also a                                 group that's open-source software they                                 coordinate                                 the entire Italian government like open                                 source projects and there's a talk yet                                 digital innovation unit and they gave a                                 talk at KDE Academy this past year which                                 was really interesting here yeah we have                                 time for one more question okay quick                                 question since the term critical mass                                 kind of implies that there's a lower                                 bound to how many people you knew it can                                 you put a number on that like what's the                                 amount of people you'd need to get it                                 started yeah I would say this is one                                 person and you need at least one person                                 either or maybe in the future there will                                 be you know AI machine learning                                 algorithms that bootstrap the community                                 but you need one person I believe and                                 that's that's very often the how things                                 start actually some person kicking it                                 often really standing or making a                                 statement for the project we have time                                 for one quick one okay thank you thanks                                 very much for that and thank you we'll                                 take a                                                            [Applause]                                 [Music]                                 you
