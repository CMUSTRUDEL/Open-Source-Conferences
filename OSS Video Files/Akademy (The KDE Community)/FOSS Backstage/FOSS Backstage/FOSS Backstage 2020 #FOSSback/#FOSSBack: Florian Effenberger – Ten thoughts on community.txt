Many activities these days, be it sports, social work, arts or free and open source software, are organized in some sort of community. If backed by a respective organization, this not only helps with setting up a structure, but also puts statutes and rules in place that set forth the values and ideals all contributors should share. Inside these communities, there can be various roles. Some of them are formalized, like the board of directors or the supervisory board, others are within dynamically grown groups that can change frequently. Either of those are ideally composed of experienced and enthusiastic community members who take leadership and responsibility.

Based on my experience from the last 16 years, I'd like to point out common problems when working in an international free and open source community, share mistakes I've made and tell how you can hopefully avoid them.

	                              okay so let me start straightaway so                               yeah thanks for having me I'm I'm glad                               to be able to speak here today and be in                               Berlin and I'd like to connect more or                               less seamlessly to the talk we have                               before and would like to give you some                               insight on lessons learned a pitfall                               traps to avoid things how from my                               perspective an open source community can                                work out and of course he always need to                                read that in in a specific context this                                is ten items that I identified they are                                not conclusively depending on which kind                                of project what your background is what                                your what your project's goals is these                                things could be different but this is                                what we learned we that is the the                                librivox project that I'm part of and I                                hope that provides some benefit for the                                work you do some some more inside some                                things so I'm in the whole feed for like                                                                                                 Liebherr office area a lot of things                                have changed have developed and are                                constantly developing and so reserve                                there's a couple of things so my my                                official role is that I'm executive                                director of the document foundation that                                is the entity behind LibreOffice and I                                was there from the beginning so I was                                one of the founders and was also back in                                the days with the open office or project                                and seen everything developing over the                                course of time and and how the whole                                area changed and I tried to share a                                couple of bits and pieces from from that                                time so one of the when when we have job                                interviews at the document foundation                                one of the more interesting questions                                for the candidates is like what is a                                community and we get a ton of actually                                pretty good answers one candidate one                                started to to paint that on a paper so                                everybody has a slightly different                                understanding of what it is and one that                                I like a lot and that is taken from the                                German Wikipedia article that talks                                about a group of people which we had                                hurt before it's made out of actual                                people we are we are not in the face yet                                that we have AI running to show share                                that entity I think is key and joint                                interests and it already starts with the                                question a group of people what is their                                background so you can be there in a pure                                private capacity private contributors in                                in the LibreOffice project we have a lot                                of these you can be there solidly with                                your corporate hat or and this is hope                                you see more and more that of course                                more and more people have jobs that are                                related to open source to free software                                and they contribute more and more so                                it's it's not mutually exclusive that                                that kind of thing that you either are a                                corporate contributor or in a private                                capacity in the end a company doesn't                                act people act and so in the end it                                doesn't matter so much                                who is what is your background you're                                part of that community                                and what we've learned is that is quite                                critical to to have those common memory                                things you can talk about like a bit                                with old school friends you have                                memories you can share and at least for                                us in the LibreOffice project that is                                one of the key things that when you meet                                people you haven't seen for a long time                                that there are things you you remember                                things common feelings common events                                that you attended something that unites                                you that builds that kind of group                                feeling that is not important what I                                don't like so much is that I think these                                days the term community is actually                                quite abused so you have any random food                                producer running a website with a forum                                or a chat and it's immediately a                                community might be in a technical sense                                but this is not what I am addressing to                                me it's a bit more so I think kind of                                the marketing that is done these days                                you have all sorts of communities around                                the washing powder and and what not                                that's not the term that I would use                                here but I mean fair enough it's it's                                simply what we see                                and no I think the if you look there the                                 it's not depth enough usually so the                                 usual websites that have those those                                 random groups it's around one specific                                 product it's usually just in one                                 direction you barely can influence what                                 is happening at just the consumer end                                 and in a true open source code you can                                 influence you can take a role so if I'm                                 on that website off the washing powder I                                 usually can't influence the marketing if                                 I'm in an open-source project I have in                                 an ideal world at least much higher                                 chances to do that so yes you got                                 Armando specifically but you're on the                                 on the receiving end you cannot be a                                 crater it's it's a broader finition                                 indeed and there are many more and I                                 think you always exclude something or                                 someone so I haven't yet found a proper                                 definition that that's why I said you                                 only interviews you get a lot of great                                 ideas and I'd like to combine all of                                 these in one big sentence but if anybody                                 has a better better definition I'd like                                 to hear that it's not so trivial                                 actually I agree                                 you could base that on two or match that                                 with the definition but that the sense                                 behind that you can be enabled you can                                 take part which we will see is missing                                 from that so it is some sort of                                 community but not what I have in mind                                 put out at least when you think about                                 how is that organized it's it's some                                 sort of creative chaos so many many                                 years ago I think could could be fifteen                                 years back in the open hours or project                                 we tried indeed to paint a picture of a                                 community and in the end we ended up                                 with an anthill you have all those ants                                 running in different directions and it                                 looks super chaotic in the end something                                 comes out of that but per se there is                                 not so much structure and this is what                                 many projects these days organize did                                 you have some more structure some more                                 leadership some more goals that you                                 share some more identity and we had two                                 people it gets even more exciting which                                 of course with my background is a is a                                 of what I want to tell you is when you                                 have an organization involved be it a                                 commercial entity be it like what the                                 document foundation is a non-profit                                 because all of a sudden apart from all                                 the human factors that you have a lot of                                 organizational things come on top you                                 have to deal with donations with funds                                 and not having money is a problem but                                 having money can also be a problem you                                 need to deal with that you need to                                 organize that you need to spend and                                 coordinate that you will in an                                 organization have certain roles that                                 could be a board that could be it was a                                 reward it could be a treasurer that                                 could be spokesperson and as such that                                 is then subject to certain rules to                                 election so there's a framework around                                 that that people have to stick to and                                 that can make things even more                                 complicated the the separation or                                 distinction between the rows here is not                                 conclusive so for me                                 former roles are those that you need to                                 have that fill a formal role like in a                                 non-profit you have a board you need to                                 have that then you often have more                                 dynamic roles that could be people                                 taking a certain role that is not                                 formalized like being a marketing                                 spokesperson but that differs you also                                 have projects and organizations that                                 have a dedicated role for that but there                                 are more formalized straws that have                                 other rules other regulations are                                 structures and there are more flexible                                 roles that can be rather easily awarded                                 or are rather easily awarded then then                                 others and what still holds true at                                 least from the projects I know that we                                 are always short on volunteer so if                                 you're not running away fast enough it's                                 it's rather easy to get a certain roller                                 to get a certain task assigned at least                                 you might not be immediately in a board                                 but getting a certain task getting                                 certain duties and some sort of role is                                 rada happens rather quickly I think                                 but then with taking some some more rows                                 some more leadership in a project you                                 also take over certain responsibilities                                 and there are certain things to avoid                                 and this is what I'm trying in the next                                 slides to break down on on ten items                                 that I identified that we learned that I                                 personally learned over the last couple                                 of years things that we ran into things                                 that we had to deal with things that for                                 us were God you experience might be a                                 different one fair enough but there's                                 some of the things that I could extract                                 from so what has happened we are at a                                 certain point why is that and and what                                 could we have avoided what would we have                                 wished we have learned up front so the                                 first thing especially if you are in an                                 organization with a large group with a                                 larger board it's usually not clear with                                 whom you are running so it's not that                                 you likely run for a board role and have                                 like three people that you run with but                                 it's an election so you might indeed end                                 up with someone you don't like you can                                 hardly work with that's that's risk it's                                 it's not different than in the company                                 you might go to a department and there                                 are people you get along with and people                                 you don't get along with so what we have                                 learned is that cooperation is essential                                 and that needs to take place in a in a                                 certain way I mean it all sounds trivial                                 but for us it's always good to remind                                 ourselves again of those those golden                                 rules you need to communicate open and                                 honestly especially if you are in a                                 volunteer capacity and you don't see                                 each other the same of us each day you                                 work remotely then that is actually                                 rather important transparency especially                                 for a document foundation has one of the                                 key things that we set up so                                 transparency for us is very very                                 important so the communication the                                 cooperation should happen in that                                 fashion                                 don't underestimate effectiveness if you                                 are just discussing for the sake of                                 discussing you will first achieve                                 nothing and second it is damn exhausting                                 and that's what happens frequently you                                 just argue and discuss and it turns                                 especially into email into a massive                                 amount of messages that serve                                 essentially no purpose                                 just to you know we'll speak your soul                                 free but it's not it's not productive so                                 especially if you spend spare time you                                 want to create something you want to see                                 something and not just end up in in                                 pointless discussions it's not possible                                 to avoid that completely we are all                                 humans but I think it's wrong important                                 thing to keep in mind that if you work                                 in an effective way doll so in the end                                 we'll give you more more pleasure module                                 and what you do then what I mentioned                                 you can work or you can end up with                                 people in a certain group with whom you                                 might not get along immediately so you                                 need to identify a few queue things that                                 you have in common because if you work                                 together you need to share something                                 otherwise it's rather pointless um                                 talking about goals or a win or plans is                                 important but the second step is of                                 missing after all those great goals but                                 who's gonna pursue them who is in charge                                 who wears the Hat that does not                                 necessarily mean doing everything                                 yourself but checking driving it                                 reporting it feeling mandated to to push                                 a topic forward and that is key because                                 the first step is easy we want to                                 achieve the following things but who's                                 gonna wear the hat on this and the                                 second step is especially in the                                 beginning of a project of missing and                                 can lead to some rather unpleasant                                 experiences a key thing is also                                 different points of view it's normal and                                 it's actually good to have different                                 points of view sometimes it's a bit like                                 salt in the soup without it's not taste                                 if it's too much it's horrible so you                                 need to find a proper balance too to get                                 along to align the views or to end up                                 with something you can all share and                                 more than once especially if you work                                 with people from other countries from                                 other cultures you will get a new                                 perspective at some point and you will                                 try to question yourself try to                                 understand others and that in the end                                 can lead to a much bigger choice then                                 you had on your screen before because                                 you you see something else you get some                                 more input and in the beginning for us                                 that was rather exhausting because we                                 were already quite busy with what we                                 were doing but then we learned to value                                 and appreciate that more and more                                 so I think it's really key and of course                                 Janna would with certain compromises you                                 need to find certain things you all                                 share you want to work on and also goals                                 they are not always exclusive you might                                 have different goals sometimes they are                                 simply exclusive but sometimes they are                                 not and acknowledging that and trying to                                 sound out what is possible and what                                 could actually work together quite well                                 is also one of the errata challenging                                 tasks I'd say and the picture I have if                                 you play the game of rope pulling so you                                 have actually people enjoying the same                                 thing there even when two different                                 sides in the game but some resistance is                                 important in the end it's important we                                 have a great time together and even if                                 you disagree on a couple of things                                 that's fine but you should be able to                                 play these the same sports that's that's                                 important the second point I named it                                 commitment because first you if if you                                 are mandated with a more formal room                                 with more responsibilities you get there                                 because of your previous commitment but                                 then it also means you have more                                 commitment in the future that's pointed                                 I find what important so of course                                 sometimes there's just a way I concede                                 and you take it fair enough                                 but you likely will not get a certain                                 responsibility or appreciation of what                                 you do if you haven't been seen before                                 if you were not present acting as a                                 specific way recognized by people                                 appreciated by people so usually it's an                                 expression of trust or the explicit or                                 implicit but that's something you should                                 make yourself clear sometimes fair                                 enough there's just a seat free and                                 people look for someone to fill that but                                 more and more and and it's in a majority                                 of of cases that you have a certain                                 reputation a positive one and this is                                 what you should make a self aware                                 however what I think is rather important                                 to understand if like if you get elected                                 into a board it is not only because you                                 did a great job and now this is your                                 mettle that you can aware and that's it                                 no actually comes with a ton of other                                 and additional work and what I want to                                 emphasize this work can be completely                                 unrelated from what you have done before                                 so if you were a marketing if you were                                 an development and all of a sudden                                 you're on the board maybe part of that                                 role is oversight over these areas but                                 you will have a ton of other work that                                 is completely unrelated and so it's not                                 just the laurels you get and you can                                 wear proudly but there is more attached                                 to it there did there are strings                                 attached and this is what I think when                                 people run for such a role especially in                                 a large organization is really key to                                 understand looking at the time that is                                 required it's really hard to say it                                 completely depends on the organization                                 what we did the document foundation is                                 to estimate over a year what is so to                                 speak the minimum amount of time you                                 have to invest for a role and we ended                                 up with like                                                            is quite a lot actually over the course                                 of the year so it shouldn't he prevent                                 you from running for a specific role but                                 you should make yourself tedious more                                 work coming on top that requires a                                 certain commitment so why is that                                 because variety sounds rather positive                                 what I want to highlight is what could                                 be a part of this this is now a slide                                 that is rather specific for for formal                                 board but now imagine you have a mix of                                 developers of QA people of marketeers of                                 localizers of infrastructure people and                                 it's all great but what you see here is                                 a ton of the tasks that they might end                                 up with dealing on a daily business or                                 at least overseeing on a daily business                                 so there is a lot of new information you                                 might have to digest and we just seen                                 that we just started with a new board at                                 a document foundation usually I do the                                 onboarding explaining a bit what's going                                 on what are the areas and that list and                                 that amount of emails we sent for the                                 onboarding basically grows every two                                 years when we have the new set of port                                 running and it's really it's not getting                                 easier I mean we have new regulations we                                 have new issues and what can be                                 frustrating is that while all of them is                                 required it's barely visible in public                                 it's nothing they                                 it's like makes you a rock star you walk                                 on a red carpet and people applaud for                                 that it's the the boring groundwork that                                 needs to be done that is not really                                 glamorous and that can be in the                                 beginning of it frustrating when you                                 have a lot of work and people don't see                                 what is going on but it heavily depends                                 on the organization the size of                                 organization obviously but this is what                                 we learned and rather the hard way so to                                 deal with all of that it's I think basic                                 knowledge to be able to learn you you                                 should be open you cannot have all of                                 that completely on your table and be                                 completely sophisticated in all of the                                 areas that's completely impossible I                                 mean everybody has their special areas                                 of interest but you need to get a bit of                                 inside how these kind of things work you                                 need to be open there must be some                                 tolerance to frustration the onboarding                                 is not so easy it's a steep learning                                 curve this is what you should keep in                                 mind when when dealing with that and                                 then if you are in a larger group                                 usually people have different skills you                                 should identify this and make use of                                 that because if you end up doing                                 everything your servant you might have                                 an accountant in your group or an IT guy                                 let them do the job that they are                                 actually skilled with and I mean it                                 sounds stupid but we identified that                                 each time when we go to the the list of                                 people taking care of certain areas if                                 you ask them so what's your your                                 interest why are you skilled people are                                 usually shy so they can tell you in my                                 day job I work in an office and I do                                 accounting but if as a hobby day I don't                                 know I'd like to write texts there might                                 be it might be good for the marketing                                 area and sounding that out that they are                                 brave enough to bring it up and say hey                                 ever interested in that area this is                                 something I really feel comfortable with                                 it's not as trivial as it may sound                                 because people usually don't run up                                 front and say yeah I'm great here and                                 I'm great yet they are usually rather                                 shy it's a bit of kind C of shaking head                                 so a bit of kind of personality but at                                 least it's the experience that we made                                 it at least there is a certain amount of                                 people rather reluctant to like waving                                 the flag and hey Here I am and this is                                 my                                 so sounded out to distribute the tasks                                 and responsibilities accordingly I think                                 that's rather important and again                                 responsibilities who is responsible for                                 what this will likely help you a lot to                                 to get all the influx of tasks done                                 properly and then at some point this is                                 what I call delegation its delegation it                                 doesn't scale anymore                                 you need to have others in the board to                                 help you out and I know those kind of                                 people who like to work long at night                                 and do everything by yourself to be                                 super competent but actually if you                                 delegate it's not a sign of weakness                                 it's a sign of strength you need to                                 delegate it's impossible in a mid to                                 large organisation to handle everything                                 yourself that just doesn't fly unless                                 you completely stop sleeping but that                                 has other unpleasant side effects so you                                 can outsource to colleagues to other                                 volunteers you might have employees they                                 are service providers and you can share                                 the tasks and they're the classical                                 areas as soon as there is some money                                 there are some resources what you want                                 to outsource unlikely these these four                                 areas and IT is a bit depends on the on                                 the area you are active so if you have                                 the skills in-house you might want to do                                 it in-house if you don't it's one of the                                 things to to first also as I guess but                                 all IDI really and sorry for everybody                                 who is in that field but I think the                                 fields are simply boring nobody really                                 wants to do in their spare time                                 accounting and and administrative stuff                                 so this is something you'll likely want                                 to outsource in the beginning to really                                 have you had free for other important                                 bits and pieces that's exactly the                                 message try to get as soon as you can                                 rid of smaller tasks of things to the                                 Neue of micromanaging things that not                                 only sucks but also only sucks a lot of                                 time if you are in a more leadership                                 role if you are there to guide people if                                 if you want to run the show                                 then you goal is really strategy long                                 term goals                                 a vision where do we want to go where do                                 we want to be in two or three years and                                 not dealing with a day-to-day business                                 that is that is not working out and                                 responsibilities is actually the next                                 slide but you have a certain                                 responsibility all of a sudden that you                                 need to follow and that doesn't fly so                                 well but all the small things that can                                 easily take up your full working day so                                 what you need to do with all the tasks                                 is to be in a position to control what                                 people working with you or for you are                                 delivering but you can't be expert in                                 all of these and we've seen a lot of                                 times that oversight is important but                                 you can't go deep it's it's simply                                 impossible after a certain amount of                                 size and one of the things especially in                                 those boring or unknown areas like                                 administration Texas and all the needle                                 topics that can surround a project these                                 days just because it's not your prime                                 topic and you're not skilled in it it                                 does not mean it's not important and                                 especially for those delivering on the                                 tasks if the perception is always like                                 it's not appreciated it's not relevant                                 that can be quite annoying so keep in                                 mind that even topics you have                                 absolutely no idea of might be of                                 critical relevance for the organization                                 that is simply simply key                                 responsibilities is and with that we are                                 already halfway true is the fifth item I                                 like to talk about so if you are in an                                 organization of course this this maybe                                 larger group there's a board or a                                 supervisory board or any entity anybody                                 you are part of it might be easy to hide                                 and say yeah but we are like                                           here we are five people or it's the big                                 membership or whatever in the end if if                                 you have been mandated for a specific                                 task you simply have a personal                                 responsibility maybe not in a legal                                 sense but at least morally ethically                                 towards those who who gave you trust so                                 in the end you need to be on the safe                                 side you need to be fine with yourself                                 at what you're doing and                                 with all the tasks and duties just to                                 repeat what I said before try to keep an                                 overview what's relevant you cannot be                                 in all of the areas it cannot cover                                 marketing development QA localization                                 it's impossible doesn't scale but keep                                 an overview what is cooking there what                                 might be pressing points meet deadlines                                 they are simply for for legal entities                                 hard deadlines that you have to meet                                 there is no way around there's no                                 discussion regulations they get more and                                 more complicated I mean we just had this                                 this GDP on topic behind us                                 there is many many more things to come                                 I'm sure beyond Dadd taxes and the basic                                 legal stuff I'm rather sure we will see                                 more things that will take our time and                                 we'll take our energy and are not                                 directly related to the core thing that                                 any project wants to do but we have to                                 deal with that it will not get easier                                 that's I think that's for sure and we                                 had the the interesting experience last                                 year think of us with the changes in                                 copyright and they are always errors                                 there can be a massive problem for for                                 any project especially if it's                                 distributed worldwide so keep that in                                 mind that is not important and again                                 just because you don't know the topic                                 does not mean it's not important it                                 might be not important but it's not a                                 given so that's something to be aware of                                 then if we talk about project made up of                                 people of course there's a massive                                 social component that's that scares like                                 in any company and I think with free                                 software projects worldwide lots of                                 volunteers different people that                                 actually is one of the more challenging                                 ones and one of those who really can                                 determine where things are going beyond                                 the ground work you need to provide                                 working together in a in a team and have                                 a certain sort of responsibility is                                 really really key so you might have and                                 this is what also we discovered over the                                 course of time you have your tasks and                                 projects but at some point in time you                                 might be large enough did you have a                                 paid team and then you run into the                                 problem that like in many organizations                                 you have a pro bono board do we let                                 India spare time maybe not have                                 need a business based on guiding people                                 on handling employees on the other hand                                 you have a set of eight contractor speed                                 employees people depending on the                                 organization and that changes the game                                 quite significantly because all of a                                 sudden you might simply end up in being                                 an employer it's no different from a                                 small local Association that maybe                                 employs one or two people you take over                                 the leadership there and then you are                                 the employer if you like it or not you                                 might be employed yourself in in your                                 professional life but you also have that                                 responsibility of the employer and that                                 can change things quite a lot so I don't                                 want to deliver a lecture on like how to                                 handle staff there are tons of people                                 who've written great books about that                                 but the basic two things I think are                                 especially in a volatile environment or                                 a changing environment like the                                 communities is give them some safety and                                 provide them a proper work environment a                                 positive one it can't be all unicorns                                 every day but try to provide some                                 positive work environment because that                                 is key and that is really important for                                 you it might be that site job or site                                 activity you have an evening but for                                 them it may be is their complete                                 income stream their complete                                 professional work life and that is                                 simply a completely different                                 perspective that you have to factor in                                 and I think especially for a project you                                 can actually make advantage of what you                                 provide because people then indeed can                                 work from home which is a key benefit                                 it's not so common still especially in                                 Germany countries are different in that                                 regard but it's a key thing you can                                 advertise with they can turn what they                                 like to do into their day job into a                                 living contribute you to something good                                 to something positive not only earning                                 money but actually moving something                                 achieving something is something you can                                 sell so when you write your job offers                                 don't just have that the basic facts but                                 advertise why why they should go with                                 you what is the good thing you promote                                 to the world and I mean as open-source                                 communities we do have things that we                                 want to give to the general public and                                 therefore this is something you can                                 really use                                 who advertise and make use of and shout                                 out to the world if you contribute here                                 if you join us actually you do something                                 good and you can well make the world a                                 better place that sort of a stupid tacky                                 but you know what I mean you can't                                 actually contribute to to something good                                 asset it's really a steep learning curve                                 especially when they do it in a                                 volunteer capacity especially with                                 volunteer teams like many projects work                                 with volunteer teams and that adds                                 another layer of complexity because not                                 everybody is immediately suited for                                 remote working from home not changing                                 the location during the day might be a                                 problem for some as we have learned so                                 just listen it's basic knowledge talk                                 with each other not about each other try                                 to listen try to sound out especially if                                 you don't see people in the office each                                 day if they're working remotely if you                                 only infrequently see them like some                                 members of my team I meet four times a                                 year because they are living on the                                 complete opposite side of the world and                                 then you need to really sound out what                                 are they up to how are they doing how                                 are they feeling and that is really                                 really important that can earn you on                                 the other hand a lot of motivation and                                 loyalty and this is what we need if you                                 invest in people if you build up a team                                 and they run away after a year you have                                 a problem you need to build it up again                                 it costs your time it cost reputation so                                 it's I think a pretty good investment to                                 do that to spend time even if it's hard                                 because it's not your daily job it's not                                 what you are trained to do try to gather                                 some knowledge and how that works and                                 simply be open I think that especially                                 in a field that we are working in is one                                 of the key competences we should have                                 been open listening being open minded                                 and as such do that also with your team                                 that brings me                                 the topic of diversity and this is the                                 larger the project gets the more                                 exciting that becomes so we have looking                                 at people who contribute to to                                 LibreOffice we have such a broad range                                 of people broad range of countries                                 backgrounds professions from students to                                 people being retired we had from one of                                 my samples we had a doctor a leading                                 doctor who was working in a field of                                 graphics so completely unrelated to what                                 he was doing in his day job and that was                                 always a quiet for him it was a change                                 he had a talent that area for me was a                                 change to the Daedra and that's minute                                 that's cool and it requires you to                                 understand certain things so language of                                 course is one one element which language                                 do you speak or if you're a native                                 English speaker at what speed do you                                 speak it makes a difference can people                                 follow meetings can you really bring                                 across the content awesome easy words if                                 you're on the same level that's fine but                                 then you might have people who speak                                 basic English and you speak fast and do                                 super complicated words especially in                                 meetings on the phone that might make a                                 big problem culture yeah we have                                 different cultural backgrounds we might                                 like certain things we might dislike                                 certain things and religion Percy I                                 mentioned it is not a key element of the                                 quanta Bouton's but it can like for for                                 the food you have at conferences makes a                                 difference or once we had our own                                 conference people were asking is there a                                 room where we can have prayers and we                                 simply didn't have to don't scream but                                 for them it was really important so the                                 more people you have the more diversity                                 is in the more you need to to learn                                 understand and there are they're great                                 things you learn that will also advance                                 you personally at the beginning it might                                 be a lot of new unknown topics that you                                 have to face and then of course with all                                 the great diversity let's face it you                                 also have to deal with complicated                                 persons that's like in daily life like                                 in a job so it's not just all the nice                                 people gotta here you also have to face                                 with complicate                                 toxic people with people trying to do a                                 harm and my take is at the moment is                                 this even going up in the community so I                                 have a couple of communities I know of                                 that really face problems at the moment                                 might be coincidence but in general                                 there are discussions they are                                 complicated people you might need to                                 address it's part of the game and I made                                 the sample before of local associations                                 the big difference for me is that much                                 of that might hold true also for small                                 local organization the big difference is                                 that in an open source community you                                 have people from around the world and                                 that is rarely the case in a small local                                 Association there might be some people                                 from other countries but it's not this                                 massive influx that you deal with people                                 from                                                                     much higher and the challenges are much                                 higher but then what you can get in                                 return is much higher as well if you                                 have all those people in work together                                 with them that can change the game quite                                 a lot to your advantage and in the end                                 the general advice you need to be open                                 you need to challenge yourself you                                 points of view might change or at least                                 you will learn a new point of view from                                 others and you need to factor it in and                                 I personally was really positively                                 surprised a couple of times it's not                                 always easy like at the conference so                                 where's the room where we can pray and                                 you're like ah okay just don't have to                                 don't screen for the next conference you                                 know you need to reach out and ask if                                 there is such a demand you can fake it                                 and you learn something that you will                                 keep so it's it's a really helpful thing                                 for my point of view speaking about                                 languages maybe a bit more to the                                 groundwork again on how to coordinate                                 all that so we have projects we have                                 people we have different feelings we                                 have diversity but how does that more or                                 less technical work technically work to                                 coordinate everything and languages is                                 key we all assume English as a language                                 spoken everywhere                                 I might object to that there are                                 countries where English is not so                                 prominent where other languages are much                                 more prominence or the basic assumption                                 everybody speaks English                                 might not work out so be careful with                                 that I have no no proper solution                                 because if if you have a variety of                                 countries and unity intact but then not                                 all of us speak like five languages but                                 this general assumption everybody speaks                                 English is wrong it's simply wrong I                                 don't want to name countries                                 specifically but we have a couple of                                 countries that simply told us so we have                                 one or two people as a gateway otherwise                                 English here is simply not resistant so                                 be careful with that also brings the                                 question if you have contracts if you                                 have anything writing with people or any                                 like which language would a code of                                 conduct be in or which languages it's                                 not so trivial it affected it in for us                                 English is fine far as it might not so                                 factor in more into that and then of                                 course the practical things like time                                 zones are great if you coordinated                                 Australia or other countries you have a                                 lot of fun daylight savings can be                                 different so does this just at the                                 practical think when the heck is our                                 meeting at which time so keep that keep                                 it in mind and then again talking about                                 times working with the team and pro bono                                 folks you have the problem I wasn't here                                 can mostly do work outside business                                 hours in evenings during weekends if you                                 have a paid team if he asked him to be                                 present like each weekend it's a kind of                                 fly so you need to find some our balance                                 how to match everything like that                                 how can a team of pro bono and paid                                 staff work together and find a meeting                                 slot that is not disturbing their daily                                 routine too much it's not so trivial                                 actually there is to media it's my ideal                                 scheduling a couple of things basic                                 things but we learned it use polls                                 alternate time slot so everybody at                                 least has chance once to join a meeting                                 and sent calendar why it's because then                                 you have the proper time zone it's it's                                 basic but we had issues several times                                 that people did not know when a meeting                                 starts even if it's written and you had                                 the time zone conversion send him a                                 calendar invite it helps actually                                 so how to communicate email is great I                                 can read and reply whenever have time on                                 the phone and it need to be present                                 immediately but then at some point after                                 the fifth hundred email it might be a                                 problem to still follow discussion might                                 be easier to take things on the phone so                                 identify what is better on a phone                                 identify what is better in email or chat                                 or whatever written conversation and for                                 emails we learned if people have too                                 many emails and who does not tech the                                 emails like urgent vote discussion info                                 so we can presort a bit that actually                                 helps a lot and in general it's                                 absolutely fine to prepare a vote in                                 email and conduct via phone or the other                                 way discussion discuss a controversial                                 topic on the phone and have two final                                 vote by email so you are not bound to                                 one media continuously over the life                                 cycle of a topic see what what's better                                 and then you need depending on the                                 organization you might have to meet a                                 deadline agenda quorum Factor didn't for                                 some its relaxed if you like an                                 association in Germany you have to                                 reduce how that has to happen so you                                 need to agree internally when is our                                 meeting deadlines when do we send the                                 agenda out otherwise what you decide                                 might be simply void and everything was                                 wasted time Trust trust sounds easy but                                 it is not I'd say so                                 at least after a certain amount of time                                 if you're in a row and you still don't                                 have trust in others or you still don't                                 feel trusted you either run away or you                                 don't fill the role properly so Trust is                                 important written communication is risky                                 because you don't see the other side                                 everybody has a different style of                                 writing and like once I had a colleague                                 who was always - a long a nice email                                 replying one sentence and it's like                                 don't you like me would do we disagree                                 then he told me no no so I'm working at                                 this company and whenever my boss is out                                 of the room I have like                                               reply to that email and then it was                                 clear but before that what an arse but                                 then it was completely different he                                 really wanted to reply he even like                                 risked a debate with his boss too                                 to my email it was a completely                                 different context but you need to know                                 that a simple email a couple of lines of                                 text are really risky to to be                                 interpreted and then we all have the                                 confirmation bias we all assume that the                                 bad feelings we had before are now                                 confirmed so talk with people try to get                                 into exchange trust people try to build                                 trust that is that is key because after                                 a certain amount of time it will be a                                 long time be in silence and you will not                                 discuss about it but there will be a                                 point that everything will pop up and                                 like the pain of the last five years                                 will really break out and that's what                                 you really want to avoid it takes time                                 energy and it's just not leading                                 anywhere and then that's what we learned                                 being based in Germany and having people                                 worldwide if you have a different legal                                 setting that can lead to some funny and                                 obscure things because if somebody from                                 the US or from the UK looks at Germany                                 or the other way around there is a ton                                 of questions and that also might lead to                                 to trust issues so try to have a                                 complicated it is try to translate try                                 to explain what is going on what the                                 rules are why there are rules so they                                 have a fair chance of getting on board                                 and understanding it the languages is                                 not a barrier to that class but maybe                                 most important reward reward is                                 important and the next and last slide is                                 simply my my very personal list I think                                 everybody has their lists of why they                                 feel rewarded or what makes them feel                                 rewarded what I'd like to see there the                                 group of people would simply like to go                                 to a big corporation and at the end of                                 the month of a massive paycheck and then                                 just spend time at weekends and                                 vacations others have completely                                 different desires and you should                                 identify if you're active in a project                                 what your personal reward is and also                                  what you want others to see as a reward                                  like appreciation if you want to be                                  appreciated appreciate honors if you                                  want to lot them if you want to help                                  them achieve a new level at their day                                  job do that so try to find out why                                  somebody is running                                  for a role try to find out what makes                                  people comfortable in contributing what                                  they are desired reward is and try to                                  give it to them everybody has their very                                  own list of things what they are really                                  comfortable with what they really would                                  like to see try to find it out and also                                  important answer this question for                                  yourself in order to to keep you happy                                  and engaged in the long run so let's                                  that was really did the condensed                                  version that all originated I think two                                  years ago when we had a new board coming                                  up and the question was can you                                  summarize a bit of what we had as                                  experiences and it's clearly very                                  subjective it's my own takes and and                                  feelings u.s. might be completely                                  different but I'd like to simply give it                                  to you as some sort of inspiration it                                  depends on the setting and the                                  organization to size and the kind of                                  people fair enough                                  but I hope it was a bit useful I'm happy                                  for questions feel free to poke me and                                  yeah thanks for your patience and thanks                                  for listening                                  [Music]                                  thank you thank you for that talk does                                  anyone have any questions thank you for                                  your talk I'd like to go back to the                                  very beginning when you had a definition                                  of a community and I realized that you                                  might not be as attached to it as you                                  know it's presented but the way you know                                  the way it's presented it might be more                                  descriptive than prescriptive but I                                  wonder if there is a way to hack it that                                  would change things a little bit so can                                  yes thank you a group of people with the                                  shared identity and joint interests I                                  wonder if one way to present it is                                  something like a shared shared values                                  and common goals and here's why                                  a lot of what I do is trying to bring                                  designers into this space and it's                                  really difficult when an identity is                                  defined in terms of common memories                                  ventures and experiences because                                  sometimes they're just not shared right                                  sometimes it's very alienating when                                  you're referring that to some                                  conferences you've been to years ago or                                  there is a very obscure Star Trek                                  reference somewhere you know like                                  there's just ways in which a shared                                  identity could be very exclusive and so                                  I wonder like if instead of saying                                  shared identity maybe there is a better                                  way to present it as shared values like                                  valleys we all hold and similar to                                  interests when you call it an interest                                  it's often you know oh we our interest                                  is building local for software or                                  something you know some something you                                  know that people can have fun doing                                  together but often times that means that                                  you are only going to reach developers                                  in that sense if you make it a common                                  goal say something like our goal is to                                  you know destroy tech monopolies or                                  something like that you might find that                                  designers are also interested in                                  participating and even lawyers in the                                  Countians right like you know that the                                  people could be the group could be much                                  more diverse than just developers and so                                  yeah I guess I don't know if this is                                  more of a question or a comment but like                                  is there a way to hack the definition to                                  make it a little bit more inclusive to                                  different groups of people I absolutely                                  like the idea so it's                                  really not easy when when I was starting                                  to talk of us as you see in the end                                  ending up at Wikipedia because I liked                                  that I was not able to come up with                                  something really descriptive or really                                  that that felt like yep that's it myself                                  I like vision you could use also passion                                  it's maybe a bit too strong depends on                                  the kind of people you address but I                                  know some in our group who are really                                  passionate who really like they they                                  have that flame they really like to do                                  that and so everything that is emotional                                  any any anything that is in an emotional                                  sense getting there is something I like                                  there are other people who see it more                                  technical and that that's fair enough                                  but it is this when I might as some                                  would have two friends from school is                                  this emotional binding they have                                  something you share whatever it's called                                  so vision sounds great to me                                  I like their approach am indeed indeed                                  thanks about leadership and especially                                  when you have a group of volunteers                                  maybe not like full timers or paid                                  people like you just also have to do                                  difficult things like in the companies                                  I've done like letting people go like                                  what's the equivalent where or did you                                  ever run two into a situation where he                                  actually has somebody in your community                                  where you said well we actually don't                                  want to work with you anymore                                  so luckily we never had to go that far                                  we were always close to like really                                  talking to people saying your behavior                                  or how we approach the other person is                                  not appropriate so at least I'm not                                  aware of a major issue luckily but my                                  take unfortunately is it was just not                                  discovered I can't imagine after that                                  amount of time with that group of people                                  nothing ever happened so that's why one                                  and I'm happy on that and I'm sure there                                  was something but at least we have                                  complicated times we have to talk to                                  people and it gets even more complicated                                  if they are friends and and you know you                                  have those those two heads and one and                                  that like so what's happening here is                                  simply not gonna work out on the other                                  end like I'm a friend of you so what the                                  heck is going on                                  and that is not so easy what we usually                                  do is trying to find our to sound out                                  who is probably best in a project a                                  person who speaks the same language or                                  who is you know the same mindset whom                                  would they trust that helps a lot it's                                  not always smooth and easy of course                                  that's the way we try to handle it and                                  we do have complicated people on various                                  occasions of course but we try for                                  example when when when when there are                                  people known to run around and annoy                                  people to say very friendly to make here                                  so if there's a problem here's a couple                                  of trusted people you can contact maybe                                  not in a code of conduct sense but like                                  if that person pops up I know them quite                                  well please poke I'm happy to talk don't                                  don't try to get into that warm I'm                                  happy to to call and and and and solve                                  the problem or talk to them so this is                                  some sort of I'd say internal knowledge                                  that we have but of course is risky if                                  some people leave Danette knowledge has                                  gone but that's how we at the moment try                                  to address it but we're eager to improve                                  on that as well so code of conduct is                                  one of the topics that we have fun but                                  their discussions to improve on that I                                  think this is key the more communities                                  grow the more they include people who                                  are simply different from the core group                                  that the more important that is I think                                  and but as you can imagine and maybe                                  some of you went to that it's not an                                  easy discussion at all thank you for the                                  talk my question also goes into a                                  similar direction I think as as your                                  question when you define diversity you                                  mentioned like different people in                                  different jobs different age different                                  culture but you didn't mention for                                  example like gender for example which no                                  no worries about that but I was just                                  curious because I read a                                  right on Twitter the other day that well                                  the amount of for example women in tech                                  is much lower than men but it's even                                  much much much lower a lot fewer                                  percentage the relationship is like more                                  off in an open source where there are                                  very few women so I was just curious do                                  you have it's a tough question but do                                  you have an explanation for that                                  and what you think could could a                                  community do to address this issue                                  yeah so indeed the debt list is also                                  most conclusive it wasn't made on                                  purpose because with that you open a                                  really massive discussions that I really                                  don't have proper answers for I share                                  your findings what we did is to discuss                                  that we had a workshop to conferences                                  ago to how to improve it it's a very                                  small first step obviously and it's not                                  a trivial topic it's a very heated                                  emotional topic and that these are                                  always really really pragmatic to to to                                  talk to I have not a real explanation I                                  perceived the same if you mean if we                                  look at our board if you look at our                                  membership base it's easy if you look at                                  the gender the the percentages is clear                                  it's exactly what you say we see it with                                  the conference's we we try our first                                  steps that I would say to to improve we                                  could do clearly much better but then it                                  really is a question how to to work on                                  that so also the opinions they are                                  different and I think it's so fragile if                                  if you move in a in a at least public in                                  a certain direction you might break this                                  i'm i don't know it i perceived                                  everybody is really careful fully aware                                  of the problem clear we should solve                                  that and luckily we do have a couple of                                  really dedicated and passionate people                                  driving that and I hope to see much more                                  calm because we perceived the same and I                                  certainly have no no perfect answer as                                  to why we see that and and how to solve                                  that I I hear many opinions but I                                  I can't combine all of them to one they                                  are they are different that makes it a                                  bit trivial if everybody is going the                                  same direction it's easy if you have                                  opposing opinions then it's prom attic                                  and I'm not the expert in that feeling                                  that makes it really challenging you                                  have to say but I'm willing to learn any                                  any more questions okay thank you                                  [Applause]                                  you
