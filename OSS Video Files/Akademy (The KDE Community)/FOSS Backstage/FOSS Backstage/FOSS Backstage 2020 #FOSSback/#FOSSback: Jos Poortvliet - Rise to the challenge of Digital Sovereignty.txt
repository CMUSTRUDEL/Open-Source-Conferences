Title: #FOSSback: Jos Poortvliet - Rise to the challenge of Digital Sovereignty
Publication date: 2020-03-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2020 #FOSSback
Description: 
	Digital Sovereignty presents a new challenge to the open source community. And with challenges come opportunities: politicians are keenly aware of strategic importance of digital sovereignty. Yes, I know, that's a first.

We have to rise to this occasion and provide solutions. That is both a matter of code and communication, as is often the case. As member of a number of open source communities that care about this and as marketing person, I have some ideas which I'd like to share!

I'll talk about what the challenge with digital sovereignty is and then discuss what we, as open source community, can do to offer decentralized solutions that address this issue.

	                              is meant to be discussion I've come up                               with a few proposals and                               also put together a few slides to                               describe the subject slash problem I                               want to put up for discussion so for                               your information this is kind of                               open-ended they've put a really long                               slot at this I've already asked if I                               have to fill that otherwise they'll hang                                me but they won't so you know by the                                time everybody's board we can just go                                home and can also stick around as long                                as you like so the subject is little                                serenity and well I have a little agenda                                and I'm sorry I was earlier thinking                                that you know inside tech jokes are not                                really good I bet many here even                                so first gonna talk about well issues                                with this serenity what the problem is                                where the cloud went wrong and after                                that I'm essentially gonna open it up I                                have a few statements and discuss                                so our cloud went wrong now I know how                                many of you have seen this image I                                thought it was kind of fascinating this                                is the movement of the US president s                                could apparently be quite easily                                gathered from public data sources on                                where mobile phones were including the                                mobile phones of his security team now                                this is well first of all quite a I                                think embarrassing thing for the US but                                it also tells says something about how                                hard it is to protect your privacy in                                our society because this is probably one                                of the best protected people in the                                world and                                so in other words there is a bit of a                                privacy issue I think this is nest and                                Google had put in a microphone but then                                apparently they didn't know it was                                recording everything I don't know if I                                believe them but it's still quite an                                amazing thing to have happened which it                                really did                                I have one last one this is a secret US                                military base in I think Afghanistan                                how does image was made well from the                                public data of a sports tracker which                                was used by the surface man walking                                around on that base again holy macaroni                                how is this possible yeah this is                                because nobody cares about privacy                                anymore and then this is what happens by                                the way this was not a mistake they did                                not take the data down they just said                                look you know maybe you shouldn't have                                use a sports tracker if you were in a                                secret military base                                okay yeah sure fair enough                                like targeting of companies based on all                                that data that we don't care about                                apparently any Society it's pretty                                extreme Facebook send a mail around in                                Australia at some point where they told                                people a little hypothetical story sell                                their services and the story pretty much                                went like this                                you know look if there's a teenager you                                know and he has asked website has asked                                someone else out for                                we know exactly when he or she is                                essentially maximum nervous about the                                date that's coming so that at just the                                right time we can present them with a                                nice ad for I don't know a perfume or a                                leather jacket so that they're most                                likely to buy isn't it awesome please                                buy advertise                                I think it's amazingly creepy they have                                this information now I do think they're                                heavily over selling their ability to                                actually monetize that for another day                                they do have this                                now ever their formation can do all                                kinds of things we know happened to the                                elections in the US and the company that                                was doing that in the UK they had made a                                really interesting psychological model                                and                                psychology's quite interesting they had                                essentially determined that people who                                scores so what they did I don't know how                                many of you are familiar with the big                                it's a personality test with like five                                main metrics there's like anxiety and                                for others but the interesting one is                                anxiety the thing is people who score                                high on anxiety they're more likely to                                 felt concerned people score low on that                                 or morning                                 and you know that's bloody useful                                 information if you're running it                                 campaigning you want to keep a portion                                 of the people home and have another go                                 all that stuff so they use that and                                 again how would they know this                                 information well they could get that                                 from                                 that's that's pretty damn first                                 it's also really interesting so targets                                 us retailer they had some automated                                 advertising                                 set up this advertisement algorithms                                 would learn automatically certain                                 patterns in customers behavior so at                                 some point they started to advertise                                 certain shampoos to women who were                                 pregnant including some who didn't even                                 know yet that and they would send them a                                 free gift packet with like baby stuff                                 and people would come and say what the                                 heck well you know if you start buying                                 certain things that can be because                                 you're pregnant I have one example was                                 women who are pregnant start to become                                 more sensitive to smells so they started                                 to buy less strong smelling soap and                                 other personal hygiene products and                                 therefore Oh clearly that person                                 suddenly starts buying this less strong                                 smelling shampoo let's send them a nice                                 packets but they might not yet know and                                 their family might not know they're                                 pregnant it might be trying to hide it                                 from them there's a problem here don't                                 you think so again and and this was                                 nobody trying to do anything evil it's                                 just you know automated algorithms                                 screwing people's lives I mean I can                                 make a really long list and I think many                                 of you in the room probably are familiar                                 with these three and you know I can make                                 and the thing is this is not even the                                 subject                                 because this is privacy and we've been                                 talking about privacy here in Germany                                 and certainly in our community for quite                                 a while and I've been given talks about                                 it for quite a while a long list of                                 examples but at least there's a bit of                                 awareness now and there's a TD PR and                                 there's other stuff and there is some                                 awareness now the lead Facebook hashtag                                 is                                 I I want to try and bring this to and                                 more call a strategic level and that's                                 what digital sovereign it is now this is                                 about what we do as a society as as a                                 government businesses yeah the thing is                                 these guys they have really changed                                 in a lot of ways and they're threatening                                 a lot of individual pride                                 but these companies are doing different                                 things                                 while they are doing is they're changing                                 business of other businesses they're                                 essentially b                                                         you as a consumer go there but they are                                 in between you and other company that's                                 trying to sell it do you know what                                 percentage booking.com gets on a hotel                                 that you                                 does anyone here have a rough idea yeah                                 that's about                                    all right that's huge I do you realize                                 how much that is there's no way that                                 what they're doing which is running a                                 bloody website costs anywhere near that                                 right their margins are insane how the                                 heck can they ask so much what can you                                 afford no being on the hotel comb or                                 booking that comb or TripAdvisor no you                                 can't so you just have to give that                                 what does that do to hotels in Europe                                 that essentially their profits are being                                 move to the US all these companies are                                 from now in these hotels they cannot                                 really do a lot of interesting things                                 anymore they have to cut costs and you                                 know when you cut costs you know doing a                                 lot of innovation now right now maybe                                 hotel don't do that much innovative                                 things these days I don't                                 well tell one a lot oh but of course if                                 you're talking about                                 well there are other companies that do                                 interesting things and what this model                                 does is it that sense Lee turns hotels                                 almost into a franchise yeah you know                                 what the model of franchises                                 I mean the people who do the work got                                 very little money and the people who                                 don't do the work they got the money                                 that's what the front circle I can go in                                 more details but this is what happened                                 and you know okay if this happens to                                 hotels I mean we'll survive our hotels                                 might be a little crap here but our                                 society will be what about these                                 companies                                 and this is what Europe's economy is                                 running on right                                 and company is like well Android auto                                 and uber and whoever else are going to                                 built or is working with them to build                                 self-driving cars they are essentially                                 gonna get a business model that's                                 probably similar to booking that car                                 because they bloody well know how much                                 money there has made that way and these                                 companies will not be making much profit                                 anymore and they will not be innovating                                 it and neither will any of the companies                                 that deliver to them                                 and well I guess we can all kind of                                 imagine what that will do to the                                 European economy and this isn't not just                                 Europe this is any country in the world                                 that is facing this very same situation                                 there's a huge amount of profit                                 accidentally going to be extracted from                                 local hopefully still innovative                                 industries and that's all gonna be made                                 by these US companies because if if uber                                 manages to become the global taxi                                 company with their own billions that's                                 perfect if they become the booking.com                                 of taxis then every taxi will be an uber                                 uber is probably gonna buy cars just in                                 the hundreds of thousands but in the                                 millions and as a negotiation position                                 for these companies it's not gonna be                                 particularly great hence very little                                 profits and we're all laughs                                 so the next round of interesting things                                 that's happening in tech has a lot to do                                 with big data data in general AI and all                                 that stuff and all that data is not                                 where it's produced I mean I made this                                 kind of eyeballing some statistics but                                 later I saw statistic that only                                       the data that's generated in the EU                                 stays in the EU one tiny little ball and                                 most of our data is in the u.s. growing                                 degree                                 China                                 and not here so if you want to build an                                 AI company and you need a lot of data                                 for that                                 well Silicon Valley is your place we                                 don't have that data anymore we've given                                 it now look all the car companies are                                 working hard on self-driving cars and at                                 the same time they're giving Android                                 auto and Apple's car thingy all the data                                 that these companies will need to be                                 able to build a self-driving car much                                 better than our car companies                                 so                                 with all that data what you can do                                 there's AI but well there's more stuff                                 you can do                                 interesting point is that you can                                 essentially control people's think now I                                 mean I talked a little bit about them I                                 was talking about privacy because if                                 you're a facebook now you know an awful                                 lot about people and you can really                                 steer them in a certain direction                                 and I'm not sure how good it is for all                                 of us a foreign country                                 I mean                                 when I talk about privacy I often                                 explain to people what the biggest                                 drivers are behind people's decisions                                 and their motivations and their idea                                 the thing is of course your beliefs                                 about the world drive your behavior if                                 you think that I don't know flying is                                 dangerous then you will be afraid to fly                                 your belief has an effect on whether                                 your beliefs come from all you think it                                 comes from what you read and your facts                                 and things you've heard and read and                                 stuff and that that's true to some                                 degree you know sociologically speaking                                 most the best predictor of people's                                 opinions is the opinions of the people                                 around them friends family                                 and how do you get the opinions of your                                 friends                                 Facebook whatsapp these companies                                 control our opinions way more than we                                 can ever imagine that and and and who's                                 to say that that Facebook cannot just                                 change your timeline because I mean God                                 knows how that is created anywhere                                 they can just put certain positive for                                 them news a little bit higher and                                 negative things a little bit nowhere                                 lower and you know if they just do this                                 to three percent different they cannot G                                 elections and nobody will ever know                                 this is just a bloody dangerous thing                                 I mean of course right now there are                                 kind of two models in which this power                                 over people's thinking is being used                                 there's one model where it's used to                                 make you want things and buy them that's                                 the capitalist model and there's a well                                 a little more dictatorial where this                                 knowledge is being used to control what                                 do you think about well those who are                                 control                                 and you                                 global-scale                                 don't we do we want either of these to                                 be controlling what we in Europe do I                                 of course there's a lot of fighting now                                 happening and I like think that though                                 we had to or Adobe did shut off                                 Venezuela from their services kinda                                 sucks if you're a design agency there                                 these days there anyway of course                                 there's a lot of fighting now but you                                 away I mean the stakes are really going                                 up and Chinese companies are now also                                 really gathering data well censoring                                 guys are pretty upfront about it and                                 they have an interesting way of doing                                 that                                 but you know who is controlling that's                                 it's it's these companies and their                                 jurisdictions and again they're                                 invariably not European                                 so yeah I know I think there's an issue                                 and this is serenity is a term that's                                 used describe this issue and that's also                                 the name under which I'd like to put it                                 let's talk about it I mean what should                                 we do because the reason of course                                 having this discussion here is I think                                 open source has a bit of a role to play                                 I mean we were just talking about                                 licenses and and who to work with                                 probably bad ideas open-source could do                                 I mean you know we're building tools to                                 help people's privacy to decentralize it                                 so next round of course that was matrix                                 so matter Mouse does that's what lots of                                 others do I mean can we do more here is                                 this the right thing to do in the first                                 place                                 I don't know is anyone else who wants to                                 say something about this because I can                                 keep talking but                                 you mention in your previous talk about                                 Silicon Valley and venture capitalist                                 and things if you're a European company                                 that's done really well at fundraising                                 and got maybe                                                         and change some bit of the world with                                 some software and your competitors just                                 raised                                                             really have a hope of changing the world                                 against that juggernaut yeah that's                                 definitely I think one of the issues I                                 think there are people here who would                                 agree that's that raising money here in                                 Europe is just amazingly much harder and                                 that's the limits that sir some                                 governments put on are really stifling                                 innovation I mean even if you have a                                 really good idea it can be amazingly                                 hard to do get funding here even if it's                                 a                                 so I mean one of the things that                                 put them in that order                                 one of the things that I've been                                 thinking I was also like should we let                                 government solve this                                 I mean governments are waking up right I                                 know how many of you have heard of Gaia                                 X                                 yeah so so Gaia X's German government                                 thing led by a minister who might not be                                 the most popular here but the idea is to                                 build an alternative to American cloud                                 services and then I'm meaning did Amazon                                 Web Services and Google Apps not Google                                 Apps platform but Google clouds you know                                 where you can run your app and I think                                 it's a good idea I also think that it                                 looks to me a bit like another attempt                                 at providing I don't know government                                 money to a bunch of companies who are                                 already addicted to it actually rather                                 opinion piece published I think                                 yesterday saying that guy X shouldn't                                 have a budget if it wants to be                                 successful because otherwise it just                                 gets companies and he'll just want some                                 money to do something fun and don't care                                 about actually getting anything but I                                 don't know you can debate whether                                 government should do this or whether we                                 should do this or both or neither or but                                 of course in the funding area that's                                 something come government can change we                                 can change the rules here and change                                 things something I wanted to mention in                                 this section is we have the problem also                                 with with with Microsoft and there's                                 office                                                               research we are not allowed to use cloud                                 services at all obviously people still                                 do it because Google Docs or some stuff                                 is just too nice to use it yes and we                                 don't have any alternative which we                                 assume is there's some stuff we can host                                 our souls and so but most of them I mean                                 yeah obviously next Slough spring brings                                 that what we say it's planned to                                 introduce that but we introduced gitlab                                 it took like three years so we're slow                                 with stuff like that but the main                                 problem for us is that like we still                                 rely on this whole Microsoft Word well                                 as a lot of research organizations do                                 and we rely on having office and now's a                                 sad they just won't tell us any                                 who copies we have to go to their cloud                                 and we are not allowed to do this by law                                 so you see this is a problem and I just                                 talked to our CTO a technical officer                                 from all of the ilaria and he talked to                                 those of other research facilities and                                 they were all like yeah we know we are                                 standing there with a lot users but come                                 on we can't do anything about it they                                 have to change the law so currently we                                 have the problem that yeah this                                 companies have the power to by just not                                 doing anything just going their way to                                 influence kind of German and European                                 laws regarding security of research data                                 just because there's no alternative                                 cable or which is accepted to I mean we                                 are really so deep in the net of                                 Microsoft                                 the only thing I can say about that it's                                 true for every area not it's completely                                 screwed up relationship                                 to fail worse than the back                                 yeah exactly it's it's law legal                                 yeah I mean this this is a need to fix                                 this you need governments to actually                                 enforce the law which is amazing but if                                 they would the problem would actually                                 get solved because obviously the Europe                                 Europe could make Microsoft forced to                                 they could force Microsoft to release                                 their cloud hosted software as a piece                                 of software that could be hosted by say                                 jÃ¡nos and that there will be possible I                                 mean obviously they could but they don't                                 want to because of course then they                                 don't make nice profits and European                                 Union fails to actually put its foot                                 down on this because well you know                                 lobbying and all these nice trips                                 you                                 so we might be circling back to                                 enforcement straightaway but I would say                                 that the most ambitious regulatory                                 attempt to do something about this would                                 be gdpr which came out of Europe do you                                 think that's moving the needle in any                                 way                                 I I think gdpr is hugely successful and                                 hugely influential which is also why you                                 see it being adopted everywhere I mean                                 California just introduced a similar law                                 it's not the same but it's it's vaguely                                 similar or fairly similar and other                                 countries are doing the same thing and I                                 I think that so there's a slightly                                 similar law coming I think that EU is                                 working on cybersecurity something                                 something which is supposed to do a                                 thing a little bit similar to the GDP                                 are where the GDP are enforced privacy                                 in price of course only the relevant for                                 individuals not for companies and the                                 cyber security law is trying to do                                 something somewhere but then for company                                 and their data companies has no privacy                                 and and I think yeah that there's the                                 government and the you in general can                                 play a role on this and and there are                                 people who seem for this there are                                 various lobbying efforts etc but you can                                 imagine I mean Microsoft is involved in                                 kayak it's completely like are you                                 kidding me why of course they are                                 because they're involved so whenever an                                 organization that has any kind of actual                                 influence tries to make any statement in                                 any direction the pressure to make sure                                 that it doesn't actually harm the                                 business of these companies and again it                                 makes sense that they're too big to fail                                 if if Germany would enforce the law that                                 nobody can work online anymore                                 well the fact that people then say oh we                                 need to fix the lowest                                 because we just need to make sure that                                 Microsoft doesn't think they get away                                 with it but the thing is of course until                                 now we've always shown them that they                                 can get away                                 that's government is in the same                                 situation they had some time ago was a                                 report that office was sending                                 essentially what you type to the                                 Microsoft server so then the Dutch                                 government of course is very upset about                                 that you know it should not be happening                                 and they can turn it off                                 Microsoft said yeah well we'll make a                                 fix and then the promise I have a fix in                                 six months                                 and they didn't                                 goodnight r                                  are you kidding me                                 of Engineers and                                 to disable something that just sends the                                 keystrokes to a server in the US that                                 does not a                                 it was not necessary for                                 so if so if gdpr is a success now I know                                 that several of the free software                                 organizations in Europe did Lobby Fuji                                 DPR in fact I remember that in Germany                                 specifically there was actually a                                 commentary around where the government                                 asked organizations in general to                                 provide input at the time I was on the                                 board of KETV and we did put a comment                                 in there so I guess the question would                                 be what we can learn from the process so                                 we can scale it up how we can be more                                 active in the next round and what                                 follow-up steps would be to replicate                                 that yeah I mean I know there are some                                 some people trying to get together and                                 and set up a lobbying organization a tea                                 fsfe is of course active in this area I                                 would say generally speaking follow that                                 lead support this kind of stuff and                                 there are people though I think                                 I mean and there of course other                                 organizations doing                                 I mean I I see a roll honest                                 you                                 I do think that the role of                                 this is a problem                                 at a level that you can't solve it I                                 think                                 you                                 yeah I have one question or a rather                                 remark you had this one slide up with                                 booking.com                                 and what I've for me is kind of                                 fascinating is that I learned way back                                 that the internet kind of cuts out the                                 middleman meaning there's business can                                 go directly to consumers and now                                 suddenly with platforms we have                                 basically pulled back where the                                 middlemen in basing middlemen inject                                 themselves and and for me it's kind of                                 fascinating treat well I think it's                                 called I do an appointment directly with                                 my hairdresser but now I am supposed to                                 go through a new middleman that somehow                                 yeah provides the service for me and I                                 guess it adds some value quote-unquote                                 in some form or a while but yeah it's                                 just I don't know if you have any                                 thoughts on that I think the model of                                 these is the same everywhere in the                                 example you give the hairdresser thinks                                 oh there is now there's really nice                                 service that I don't need to handle                                 these appointments anymore and they just                                 start either not three percent so I'm                                 gonna send my customers there so that                                 they make an appointment there and now                                 in the worth it right because I'm                                 spending way more to handle this much                                 yeah and then ten years from now when                                 everybody is always using that website                                 and of course thirty percent and your                                 hairdresser and this is the business                                 model of this and it's amazingly                                 transparent than ever                                 that's why these companies are spending                                 so much money to get into this position                                 I mean the amount of money like billions                                 as it came to the funding point that was                                 made earlier                                 they're throwing enormous amount of                                 money at this to get into this position                                 of being the middleman you cannot skip                                 and then they can extract amazing                                 profits and as a consumer you don't you                                 don't even see it because boo King Kong                                 forbids the hotels from offering a lower                                 price on their own website                                 I mean and with car companies I've asked                                 a few times at Europcar like hey you                                 know if I just come to your website                                 I see higher prices than what I see on                                 the various car rental sites they say                                 yeah that's that's true you should book                                 there                                 yeah it's really nice for them                                 I want to ask a little bit about how we                                 define success in this story because we                                 talked about like GDP our being                                 successful I've worked in or an                                 organization that was implementing GDP                                 our and that's horrible even in the                                 process we spoke with a lot of other                                 engineering companies and frankly the                                 way people were implementing GDP are                                 made almost no difference to the end                                 consumer and yet we were compliant so I                                 would challenge the fact that we call                                 GDP are successful and I'm wondering                                 what the success actually looked like                                 for the consumer and at what cost are we                                 how do we want to cost this out because                                 GDP are is extremely expensive to                                 implement and I think in some places it                                 hasn't done what we hoped it would so                                 I'm wondering how do we want to price                                 this out as well and how do we want to                                 convince people that this is worth the                                 cost because I think in a lot of                                 people's minds it's about what do I get                                 as consumer out of this they don't                                 necessarily see the the bad parts of of                                 losing access to their data so how do we                                 convince people that this is this is                                 worth it how do we motivate people and                                 yeah and how do we talk about success in                                 this this realm                                 sorry that's a lot of things in one yeah                                 so the first point you made is like in                                 in a bunch of engineering companies you                                 saw that was implemented in a way that                                 you don't think consumer any benefit but                                 then if that's the case already sure GDP                                 are compliant absolutely                                               rooms with lawyers saying experts saying                                 yes yes you're compliant this is fine                                 and part of it had to do with the fact                                 that if you knew that you weren't                                 compliant but said that you would be                                 compliant that's enough yeah but that's                                 a temporary fix                                 sure but if everyone's doing that and I                                 pretty sure a lot of people are doing it                                 then it's not it's not actually doing                                 what you know what the law says and what                                 people are reading into it as but that's                                 a temporary thing and I think is totally                                 legit for a law that is as impactful as                                 a GDP are to have a quality grace period                                 I don't know about you but I regularly                                 see pretty hefty fines already being                                 handed out for the GD P R and those                                 fines are going up of course you also                                 have to keep in mind that the companies                                 you're probably talking about were not                                 primarily the companies that the GD P R                                 tries to                                 get in line now the target of the gdpr                                 was to make some people would go as far                                 as to say that the goal of the gdpr was                                 to make the business model of companies                                 whose primary business model is to                                 essentially abuse people's data in a                                 arguably immortal way in                                 argue it filter that with you know I                                 think it definitely made it harder and                                 companies small companies were never                                 meant to get too much hardship that part                                 perhaps filled in some ways I think a                                 lot of companies are very afraid of it I                                 mean I implemented the GDP are largely                                 at next clouds yeah it's it's a bunch of                                 work but I think it does you know it's                                 like the GDP are are at the TPL                                 compliance in a company you know getting                                 your compliance and order as a pain in                                 the ass but once you've got chidden                                 order it's actually better for everyone                                 and I think in that regard                                 GDP re-enforces a kind of hygiene right                                 so again I would argue that what's                                 missing is a success criteria that                                 matters so I mean I'm speaking like an                                 engineer I talk about goals and success                                 criteria but if if everybody influenced                                 GDP are perfectly but no consumer                                 actually execute their right to withhold                                 data or to delete data or like it's not                                 successful then well the goal of course                                 yeah like there's no point in doing it                                 if no one but the goal was of course not                                 to make everybody remove that data from                                 the people the ability to do so if they                                 want it right so of course the reality                                 is that only a small percentage cares                                 right so if you if you look at the costs                                 then involved you know if                                               consumers are actually exhibiting                                 control over their data versus the                                 impact to the economy in a sense like it                                 seems like we're not people people don't                                 yet understand the cost to them for not                                 having control over their data otherwise                                 more people would be that's true but                                 once they realize that the systems that                                 companies are now actually in place to                                 give them what they want which is                                 control over that data and that was not                                 the case a few years ago                                 but yeah I know what you mean I think I                                 think the gdpr has done a lot in terms                                 of awareness and in terms of actually                                 making sure that companies deal in the                                 right way with data or at least better                                 maybe not always the right way                                 and that has definitely been hit to                                 Facebook I mean hey they did not grow                                 for like two quarters or something                                 you                                 of course it didn't fix the problem of                                 the dominance of these companies and                                 their business models that's true                                 so I guess I guess part of what I'm                                 saying is I think we need to be smarter                                 about how we motivate people to take                                 control of their data and not just pass                                 regulate                                 red tape I think there are some sides to                                 it though I think part of it is just mr.                                 lobbying we talked about earlier I mean                                 obviously the GDP went through the same                                 process and whatever law we will push                                 through that tries to address either                                 this is serenity or privacy or related                                 issues it's gonna get watered down to                                 quite a point by really heavy lobbying                                 the same awareness I mean a lot of                                 people just don't fundamentally don't                                 get it I mean recently I managed to                                 actually get through to my dad for I                                 think the first time ever when it comes                                 to privacy because I told him at some                                 point you know he has a pacemaker and I                                 told him look you know would you accept                                 a pacemaker from your doctor when you                                 knew that not a single doctor in the                                 Netherlands would be willing to use that                                 brand of pacemaker it was like no I said                                 well if I tell you that pretty much no                                 or that most security people you know                                 exercise their right or care about                                 privacy or don't put their stuff at                                 Gmail would you then agree that maybe                                 there's a problem with it the first time                                 he said huh yeah maybe you know but it's                                 it's hard to get this into people and                                 that's not gonna succeed ever completely                                 either so like solving the problem I                                 don't know that's we're never gonna                                 solve the problem completely but we                                 might avoid complete meltdown                                 by fighting                                 I think this is really a great and                                 important                                 Cashin and I would say that the problem                                 is too big to to look at the single                                 point of solution so to speak so I think                                 it's a it needs a very broad approach                                 it's about policymaking it's about                                 deciding whether children should be                                 taught how to how to deal with a                                 Microsoft product or if they should in                                 general learn about the technology                                 behind it if we let Microsoft into the                                 schools we shouldn't be surprised that                                 they get such a lot of power so I think                                 in the process of Education you have to                                 make influence you have to I mean we are                                 all I think activists in that scene so I                                 don't have to tell you what we should do                                 together but I think we should be aware                                 that it needs our common effort to make                                 a change because the problem is so big                                 that we cannot assessing a entity or                                 approach fight against these powers and                                 money flows and I think money flow is                                 also a very important issue                                 I think for most of the topics for                                 example let's say Microsoft Office I                                 mean what are they doing how are people                                 using this product what they are                                 actually offering most I would say                                                                                                        from that is already available as free                                 software why are people not using it I                                 don't know and what do we have to do to                                 make this happen                                 no I don't know yeah it one more two                                 more points please one is that economy                                 is an important issue I think we need to                                 lobby for more people to be willing to                                 pay for a free software because economy                                 is key to everything                                 and I don't understand why people are                                 not willing to pay much less than they                                 are paying for proprietary software than                                 they are willing to pay for free                                 software and the second thing is the                                 products have to be better                                 I mean the                                 what we are delivering as free software                                 must also become more competitive in the                                 sense of usability and stuff like that                                 and I think in that case it may also be                                 helpful to join forces                                 I mean maybe sometimes at from a                                 strategic point of view it's not so                                 clever to start the so in so many the                                 project of the same in the same field                                 but really to to join forces and try to                                 improve products that are projects that                                 are already around I mean for if you                                 think about XMPP or chat for example why                                 the hell I mean how could that happen                                 why are we why are people using whatsapp                                 instead of Shaba I mean what's the                                 difference you chat with other people                                 but obviously because the the client was                                 more appealing use use of more colorful                                 better design I don't know but I think                                 that's what we need to continue to do                                 yeah I think a lot of it bows down T to                                 the economic side I mean can talk long                                 about we talked about business models in                                 previous talk and I think that's                                 definitely a part of it                                 we need to do better in in the open                                 source community in building businesses                                 honestly I mean                                 I'm doing it right and it's it's                                 interesting that it works and how well                                 it works and I see just too many                                 companies well and I was a super general                                 tip I would say stop doing so much                                 consulting and focus more on                                 subscription and now it's really hard                                 it's much harder to sell up subscription                                 and consulting but it's consulting isn't                                 gonna get you anywhere I mean we we say                                 no to consulting projects even if they                                 are very profitable because doesn't work                                 and every hour we spend on consulting                                 we're not spending on essentially                                 something that will benefit a                                 subscription now I'm happy to talk about                                 that in private to people about how you                                 can move your company from consulting I                                 think and this will have an effect on                                 the quality of the price because what I                                 don't like personally I'm often asked                                 even by people hey do you want to do we                                 want to donate to neck you know we're                                 using it as a company we're happy to                                 donate                                 I always said I don't want your donation                                 I want your business I want to be able                                 to provide a service that you want to                                 pay for otherwise I don't want to feel                                 you're a strong in my direction because                                 that's not gonna sustain my business so                                 I don't really want to convince people                                 that they should pay as much for open                                 source as to pay for proprietary per se                                 I do think that there is an awareness                                 thing that needs to be done as you                                 mentioned earlier there is this bigger                                 awareness in some areas of the market                                 where people do software development                                 together they realize it is smart to                                 contribute because it helps their                                 business in the long run and a similar                                 thing I think needs to happen in the                                 industry that companies need to realize                                 that you should get a subscription for                                 the software that you because it will                                 help you in the long run with more                                 reliable better service not because                                 you're being nice and donating because                                 but just directly because a benefit you                                 as a business yes all the slightly                                 longer term thinking than three months                                 so I think it's more of an awareness and                                 it's more about getting companies to                                 realize and I think all of that will                                 indeed help and strengthen source in                                 general which will also be helpful I                                 think for industry now bringing it a                                 little bit closer to digital serenity                                 one thing that I find amazing is that if                                 you just think about how much money is                                 being paid for make the top five of                                 proprietary American software vendors                                 and what the open-source community and                                 businesses could do with that money when                                 we're at next cloud                                 Partners have built a product that                                 one-on-one                                 we've done that that's                                 the numbers                                 it would be government to actually start                                 to take open-source serious purchase it                                 and that will change the whole equation                                 because a big part bolts down                                 like aus it's amazingly hard to sell to                                 government and it's amazingly easy for                                 Microsoft yes part of it is because for                                 every one salesperson I will take and                                 bring in a can of                                                   confidence and of course they don't ever                                 wanna lose a serious deal reputations on                                 the line and oh my god if they would                                 lose one deal they will do everything to                                 make sure that everybody and that it                                 goes wrong how many where for this is in                                 the end also a decision purchasing                                 decision at government                                 and yeah there's a bit of a                                 too-big-to-fail right if government                                 would stop using Microsoft Office                                 tomorrow then economy of Europe would                                 probably grind to a halt but you know                                 what if Trump has a bad day and decides                                 that you know Microsoft is no longer                                 allowed to offer services to Europe our                                 economy also crimes to a halt is this                                 really the situation you want to be in                                 are you freaking kidding and this is                                 just a ridiculous amount of dependence                                 we have and just purely the fact that if                                 you realize that then would still argue                                 for a hour okay but we need to change                                 the law to allow it                                 Steve anyway anymore                                 yes does the digital sovereignty project                                 plan to do awareness-raising for the                                 benefits of on premise self hosted                                 software is that part of the goals of                                 the project so the question is what                                 project you're talking about Digital                                 sovereignty is in the website ah the                                 website yeah there is a website digital                                 serenity of the log but that one's mine                                 together with Frank but that's not as                                 much of a project as it is just a                                 website where we hope to get opinions of                                 various people                                  together                                  but everyone who posts there                                  be able to espouse their own agenda or                                  opinion have to necessarily mess with                                  minds or certainly not as long as they                                  are not say shields but                                  obviously                                  that our people I would                                  I have not advertised this side I really                                  plan on doing that but yet                                  post doesn't                                  you                                  anymore yeah yeah you mentioned that                                  it's hard to convince to go                                  I'll do buy it just buy it I diet                                  you                                  because if you want to sorry for that I                                  had it on yield because if you want to                                  build a good product you need to have                                  some pressure that aligns your work with                                  the market and if you just get random                                  money from the government                                  you're not gonna build a good product                                  ever I'm sorry so the government should                                  pay for a service that they need and                                  that helps otherwise I don't want their                                  money so that's why it thinks my                                  question is the Ministry of Economic                                  initiated this project called Gaia X                                  which I heard or I guess mixed cloud is                                  involved with yes so it would be very                                  interesting to hear your your opinion on                                  that so well first of all that mean                                  unplug it again because I actually wrote                                  that piece I mentioned earlier about guy                                  acts that's what this serenity dolor but                                  I know it's also been circled around in                                  the German government                                  yes well trusting enough they like my                                  opinion                                  so the idea of kayaks is to build this                                  alternative right for us Klaus but they                                  want to do this in a distributed way so                                  as I well let's say some a techie person                                  for a minute what I kind of think is                                  what they're gonna come out of is to                                  have a single standard stack that's a                                  OpenStack orchestration kubernetes or                                  stuff like that                                  some stack that different cloud vendors                                  can run and that has enough                                  standardization that if you run your                                  application container in place X you can                                  migrate very easy and quickly to place                                  why                                  maybe even there's a single portal now                                  you go to I don't know Gaia XCOM you say                                  okay I need an exile server                                  I wanna house it in a German provider in                                  the data center in Munich okay here are                                  the vendors click pay your app is                                  running such a platform it's essentially                                  what amazon offers except kind of                                  decentralized standardized and                                  now again I'm purely predicting well I                                  feel the direction is and whether they                                  ever get there is a big question to be                                  honest because                                  it's bill smart attack like that                                  usually but if it would go that way I                                  think it's and we have the technology                                  for it to do this right I mean all of                                  you here can probably in the weekend put                                  together the proof of concepts a but                                  describe how to build one                                  this is technically not a I mean come on                                  OpenStack all this stuff kuba needs that                                  exists companies are building it it's                                  open-source you can deploy this this is                                  not a terribly hard thing to do I mean I                                  find it fascinating as one of                                  Microsoft's strongest arguments against                                  Gaia X and digits of rarity is that                                  Europe can't do it because you're not                                  really difficult to build a cloud                                  platform yeah yeah only we can do that                                  anyway I mean I think this is not bad                                  per se                                  but what I'm worried about is that the                                  German government is gonna say okay you                                  know we have I don't know                                                                                                                         implement it and I think most of you can                                  do a back-of-the-envelope calculation                                  say of                                                                 thousand times yeah and that's what the                                  pro that's where the problem will be                                  this is just gonna get stuck in like                                  busy for a while and                                  that's why I made an argument I said                                  let's just not give any money to it but                                  instead maybe just say look two years                                  from now twenty percent or ten percent                                  of the German government's European                                  governments applications have to run on                                  it now there's an incentive because                                  without results there's no money and of                                  the opposite of the usual way                                  and that's                                  it's my opinion                                  that's worth                                  you                                  anyone                                  okay yeah thank you very much for that                                  that was a great discussion                                  [Applause]                                  [Music]                                  you
