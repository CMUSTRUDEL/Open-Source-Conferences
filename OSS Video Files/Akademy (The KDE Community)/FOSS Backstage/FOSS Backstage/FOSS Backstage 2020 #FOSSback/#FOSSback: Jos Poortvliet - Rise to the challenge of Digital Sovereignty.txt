Title: #FOSSback: Jos Poortvliet - Rise to the challenge of Digital Sovereignty
Publication date: 2020-03-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2020 #FOSSback
Description: 
	Digital Sovereignty presents a new challenge to the open source community. And with challenges come opportunities: politicians are keenly aware of strategic importance of digital sovereignty. Yes, I know, that's a first.

We have to rise to this occasion and provide solutions. That is both a matter of code and communication, as is often the case. As member of a number of open source communities that care about this and as marketing person, I have some ideas which I'd like to share!

I'll talk about what the challenge with digital sovereignty is and then discuss what we, as open source community, can do to offer decentralized solutions that address this issue.
