If you are a Free Software (Open Source Software) developer, do you have to follow an open development model or a certain business model? Do you have to believe in or be a supporter of socialism, capitalism, or liberalism? Do we, when we work for software freedom, have to agree on certain positions on privacy, intelligence services, the military, the climate catastrophe, nuclear power, vaccinations, or animal rights? Or should we accept to have different views or even allow each other not to discuss certain views, because what brings us together are other values?

I will argue that the core values of our movement are that everybody, no matter what background, can use the software for every purpose without discrimination. That everybody is allowed to study how software works. That you are always allowed to share your software with others, either to help other human beings or to make money. And that no individual, organisation or government should be forced to change their behaviour because of the software, but according to our principles, adapt and thereby improve the software for themselves and others.

Furthermore, the talk understands itself as a plea for more respect and diversity in Free Software communities. It will be argued that while sticking to those values we should treat others decently who might have other believes, or another or no opinions at all about a topic we ourselves care about. That we should not try to put an emphasis on our other believes while working together on Free Software/Open Source Software, but instead work together with other groups or movements to bring our other topics forward.

	                              so thank you very much for the                               invitation I'm here today to talk with                               you about core values of software                               freedom and before we start with that I                               would like to get a better feeling of                               how you feel about certain topics so                               let's get started I will ask you the                               question three first one is okay                               something did not work sorry okay no                                first question who of you hear things                                that cover your governments military                                should not operate in other countries                                can you show the hands and next question                                who here thinks that it should be                                mandatory to be vaccinated okay and the                                last question it's a religious question                                and most people say you shouldn't do                                that in a talk I still want to do it so                                who are few things that Emax is the best                                operating system or editor okay good                                thank you very much for that we will                                come back to some of those questions in                                the talk so when we are talking about                                the core values of software freedom it's                                good to have a look at where this                                movement is coming from and so we are                                going back to the time when your                                computer didn't fit in your pocket but                                you needed some room for that and at                                that time the software which was coming                                with the computers was in source code                                form and you were able to make                                modifications to that there was no                                restriction what you can do with that                                you you got it you could to make changes                                in most cases you even had to do changes                                to make anything meaningful with it and                                you could pass it on to other colleagues                                in your department                                or pass it on to other researchers and                                that was all possible there was no                                restriction then over the time some                                companies figured out that you can make                                way more money if you restrict how                                software is handled and they introduced                                in the in the software licences                                restrictions on this what people can and                                cannot do with the software and all the                                time those restrictions they got more                                and more bothersome to people and at one                                point people decided to make a change                                and fight against this and they said                                that they would like to build an                                operating system the new operating                                system where every component there is                                able to is giving you the rights you had                                before and for this they had to write                                down what what are those fundamental                                rights you had before those freedoms and                                they came up with in the end four points                                that everybody should allowed to use the                                software for any purpose that you should                                be allowed to study how the software                                works that you should be allowed to                                share it with others and in the end also                                improve it and make a dot make changes                                to the software so that's what they                                wrote down in the free software                                definition by the GNU project and the                                efsf and from there on started trying to                                rebuild the whole whole operating system                                where each of those components gives you                                those rights later there are other                                organizations who define that in a                                longer list like here with Debian or the                                open source initiative they define that                                with ten points I will not go into the                                details of those ten points I will come                                back to some of those I'm never able to                                remember all those ten points I can                                remember the four points I will stick                                with those at the moment in the talk                                but they define the same thing there and                                just to clarify before when I'm talking                                here about the values of software                                freedom and then I say free software I                                mean the same thing as when people from                                the open source initiative say open                                source or when someone else says floss                                or Foss that's the same thing for me                                it's similar to what is this tell me a                                car anything else a mini some people say                                it's a BMW when it's about a brand some                                people say it's a computer on four                                wheels or several hundred computers on                                four wheels and some say it's a vehicle                                depending on what you say you highlight                                different aspects you will be perceived                                differently it's a little bit a                                 different meaning what you transport but                                 in the end people will understand that                                 it's about this thing there and that's                                 the same for four there was out of terms                                 so when I'm talking here about free                                 software I mean the same thing as when                                 others say open-source or false of loss                                 or Libre software just to clarify that                                 before so now over the time these what                                 what is this movement about was was                                 often questioned or there were                                 misunderstandings about that so one of                                 the first things which which came up was                                 does it mean                                 and in software freedom that you also                                 have this value of creative software                                 that it should be available for everyone                                 without the need of having money to pay                                 for it and that's something which came                                 up already very early and there were                                 several clarifications about that but                                 still a word over the time it came up                                 repeatedly and also because of the often                                 in in the english word free software the                                 misunderstanding that it's it's about                                 the greatest part this come up regularly                                 and we we also see it that people they                                 contact us constantly they they tell us                                 there is a piece of software out there                                 they claim it's free software but you                                 have to pay for it when you want to                                 download it so they are violating our                                 principles they are violating our well                                 use that cannot be free software when                                 when they charge for it or they they                                 also tell you in EPS tours that it's not                                 possible that this is free software when                                 you when you have to pay for it and                                 that's one of the things which in the in                                 the free software movement which had to                                 be repeated repeated leaved that it's                                 absolutely fine to charge for software                                 that's not included in there it's not                                 about that you have to pass on something                                 without having to pay for it                                 the ever severe on the contrary we                                 encourage people to pay for free                                 software and that you pay for software                                 developers give you more freedom and                                 don't restrict you on what you can do                                 give more money to those people then to                                 those who restrict what you can                                 afterwards do with it                                 so charging money for free software is                                 absolutely fine there's nothing in there                                 and it's also something which repeatedly                                 in the discussions there was a common                                 misunderstanding in the free software                                 community that is okay to do so                                 furthermore a lot of people during the                                 time believe that free software is equal                                 to the perception that people should                                 altogether develop a software everybody                                 should be allowed to participate in                                 developing the software this                                 understanding came bit from the from                                 very very famous projects which had this                                 approach so everybody was able to                                 participate there and that's why a lot                                 of people during the years they think                                 that something cannot be free software                                 or is violating the principles if people                                 don't let them participate in their                                 project or if people don't want to give                                 them the source code at the moment when                                 they don't have any relationship with                                 each other and then they they say that                                 our principles are violated there                                 and that's something where the                                 development model and what free software                                 open-source the support that's not the                                 same thing you can develop software in                                 your basement sit there ignore everybody                                 around you don't take any phone calls                                 don't read any emails when you are on                                 the street and someone tells you your                                 software should have this feature you                                 just ignore that person you can do that                                 and then sell this software to someone                                 give them the source code or the offer                                 to give the source code give them the                                 those four rights that's absolutely fine                                 to do so you can do that that's still                                 free software on the other hand if                                    universities around the globe are                                 developing a software and the students                                 are allowed to participate every                                 professor is allowed to participate and                                 even the public is allowed to                                 participate but they write that you are                                 only allowed to use it for academic                                 purposes it's violating some of the                                 other principles there it's not free                                 software anymore it's proprietary                                 software because not everybody is                                 allowed to use it for any purpose but                                 it's still a very open development model                                 is possible that hundreds of people are                                 developing this together on the same                                 side it's also possible that this is                                 changing over the time so you have some                                 people out there developing free                                 software some groups and for some time                                 they are listening in a lot to everybody                                 around them and participate in their                                 discs in the discussions with with their                                 community but then they have a client                                 who wants to have a certain feature or a                                 certain product where the software is                                 integrated and then you need to make the                                 deadlines and it's possible that during                                 that time you don't read the mailing                                 lists or forums or don't check your IRC                                 channels as you did before and ignore                                 other people around you till you made                                 this product and it's possible that                                 afterwards you see oh that works also                                 for me better and you stay with that or                                 after some time you go back yet that's                                 all possible with free software so the                                 development model and the the if                                 free software or proprietary software                                 that's not directly related to each                                 other                                 beside those misunderstandings which                                 occurred over the time and where did the                                 free software movement had discussions                                 about that if things are good or bad                                 about this and what's what's right or                                 wrong                                 there were also then people who said                                 that                                 I I like that you are able to use study                                 share and improve the software there's                                 just one small thing that is missing for                                 me that this also covers my ethical                                 beliefs one of the very common example                                 of one of the very famous examples here                                 over the years was that people said the                                 military should not be allowed to use                                 the software because when I develop                                 something I don't want afterwards people                                 to use that software to kill others                                 that's against my beliefs I don't want                                 that to happen and they thought about                                 introducing something in the licenses                                 where those freedoms I I mentioned                                 before to you study and improve software                                 but they are written down in software                                 and wanted to introduce clauses like                                 this to prevent military use now over                                 the years this debate was repeated and                                 one of the first things which is often                                 questioned when introducing something                                 like this is you imagine someone who                                 wants to kill others and thereby heavily                                 do bad things to other people do you                                 believe that they will check what is                                 written in some license and will adhere                                 to what is written there just because                                 like Cornelius is writing down please                                 don't use don't use my software for for                                 military they would all know no I am it                                 would be so handy to use that software                                 now to kill those people and and achieve                                 my goals but he wrote that down so let's                                 do that let's find                                                       make to write this piece which he                                 developed over the last                                    and and do it do it differently so I                                 mean that that's a question which came                                 up there how much effect does it really                                 have to include something like this the                                 the other question which came up is what                                 does military use mean do you think                                 should should the software be allowed to                                 be used in in this in this car vehicle                                 computer on wheels should it be allowed                                 I mean in many parts around the world                                 you attach a machine gun on this and                                 that's the tank of the                                                 it's very difficult to to make a                                 decision there is are they didn't                                 allowed to do that and what about a                                 company who is producing this our date                                 and allow to to use the software because                                 they are producing the equipment for the                                 military it's a very very tough decision                                 there so how to define what is military                                 use and if you depending on where you                                 are coming from where you grow up you                                 also have a very different understanding                                 of what the military actually is because                                 around the world it differs what the                                 responsibilities are so in some                                 countries the main responsibility of the                                 military is to use tanks machine guns                                 other weapons and defend the country or                                 attack a country but there are other                                 countries where the military is                                 responsible to take care about fires                                 like you have a large forest fires and                                 they do this there or in cases of lots                                 and other catastrophes they are in                                 charge of handling this and helping the                                 helping the population to to deal with                                 that in some countries it's even there                                 there is not that much emergency for for                                 when you're insured it's it's an also                                 the military which gets you down from                                 the mountains and rescues you so the                                 question is then if you prevent military                                 usage or in general if you prevent                                 certain usage what other usages are you                                 thereby preventing                                 because you have some third and                                 background and some third and thinking                                 what what you believe this area is                                 covering it might be completely                                 different in another part of the world                                 one of the other topics that also came                                 up was that someone wrote a license                                 which said that you should not be                                 allowed to use the software if you are                                 not not vaccinated and as a company you                                 are not allowed to use the software if                                 you don't make sure that your employees                                 are vaccinated because I mean person I                                 don't wanted to test some things about                                 free software licensing or wanted to had                                 a belief about public health and what to                                 do there and then wanted to introduce                                 this or have others stick to their value                                 system there and there was of the                                 question I mean how much control should                                 a programmer have over others how much                                 of your own belief system you should you                                 be allowed to transfer on others what is                                 right and what is wrong there most of                                 the times so now the free software                                 movement always came back that's too                                 much we should not allow a programmer to                                 have so much power over users what are                                 developers and I mean those are not just                                 two examples there are many many more so                                 there are people have written licenses                                 or made suggestions that it should be                                 free software but you should not allow                                 to use it in nuclear power plants it                                 should be free software but it should                                 not be allowed to use for people who who                                 do animal testing or genetic engineered                                 food or in general genetic engineering                                 or about certain aspects of label law                                 that companies should not be allowed to                                 use it if they have a certain amount of                                 working hours and no breaks and some of                                 them they were even that general that                                 they said don't use it for evil purposes                                 which is even more complicated than to                                 think about what is that depending I                                 mean I I would be quite sure that if we                                 go through several topics here some of                                 you would say it's evil some of you                                 would say it could be fine in certain                                 circumstances and a lot of the examples                                 here even if we here would agree that                                 most of them would be good if they would                                 not be done with the software we develop                                 think about the most evil person you                                 know or you ever encountered and think                                 about what might they include in their                                 licenses what people they might include                                 what use cases they might exclude and                                 what they want to force you when you are                                 using the software so as much as it is                                 under as I can understand that people                                 want their their believes to be                                 transported in in their work it's it's                                 difficult to do that with software                                 licensing and it's something where a lot                                 of people in the free software                                 communities they saw all the time or SS                                 those well use are embedded in the in                                 the software licenses the you study                                 share and improve it's it's embedded in                                 there and they they have to believe that                                 it's also true to the licenses that this                                 is the case because you saw that you had                                 achieved certain things with this for                                 many this tool of free software                                 licensing is bit the hammer and then a                                 lot of problems the rest of the problems                                 out there they look like nails and you                                 you try to fix it with that and that's                                 often from the power                                 not probably the right approach there to                                 try to fix everything with with this one                                 tool but you should consider if there                                 was other beliefs if you can also                                 achieve that with changing laws with                                 changing social norms influencing the                                 markets or changing the architecture and                                 other measures how you can regulate                                 society in the end after all those                                 discussions and and debates over                                    years of the free software movement in                                 the end it always came back that yeah                                 it's it's really difficult to add other                                 things there and at the core it's it's                                 those mainly those four points or those                                                                                                        the process and which we wrote down and                                 codified by that so to go a bit deeper                                 into them again Saudi it always came                                 back to the belief that anyone should be                                 allowed to use the software for any                                 purpose without getting permission so                                 there should be no discrimination who                                 should be allowed to use the software                                 and who should not be allowed to use the                                 software it's not the programmers                                 decision it's everybody is allowed to do                                 that and also without any restrictions                                 and no negotiation there so you should                                 not be have to go to the programmer                                 first and ask am I allowed to do this am                                 I allowed to do that that's one of the                                 main features with free software all of                                 you in here who of you office is a                                 lawyer and you lawyer in here okay I can                                 tell you even if none of you is a lawyer                                 when someone out there is asking you can                                 I do this with the software you can say                                 yes and you can be so sure that you can                                 say yes I'm really sure you can you are                                 allowed to do this and am I also allowed                                 to do it yes you two are allowed to do                                 it but can I do it can I do this with it                                 you can say yes yes yes without having                                 to study the does license without                                 needing to read the license at all you                                 always know that when something is free                                 software and it's theirs it's clear that                                 it's free software you can do that you                                 you don't have to to do the any checks                                 there so                                 even people who cannot read they know                                 they can do anything with it and                                 furthermore it's always allowed to                                 understand what the software is doing to                                 study the source code of the software so                                 nobody is restricted what they can learn                                 how software works around them so the                                 free software movement they don't limit                                 we don't limit what people can                                 understand about technology there you're                                 always allowed to understand that to                                 learn from it and to discuss what you                                 found out how software works with the                                 rest of society and have a debate is                                 this right or wrong in your opinion                                 that's something which is always allowed                                 with free software and furthermore                                 you're always allowed to share it with                                 others again so there is no no                                 restriction with how many people you can                                 share you can share it publicly without                                 getting any money because you want to                                 help people you can also decide well I                                 would like to to make a lot of money and                                 you you sell the software to others and                                 you can I mean you can do that for your                                 own benefit or to help others and you                                 never need any permission for that                                 it's not necessary that you ask someone                                 if you are allowed to share it with                                 others again you can take a software                                 where you paid a lot of money and you                                 you know someone who doesn't have a lot                                 of money you can just pass it on without                                 asking for any money for it that's                                 always possible so people should not be                                 restricted how they can help others or                                 what they can do with                                             software there and furthermore in the                                 world we are born more software more and                                 more devices around us and more and more                                 processes around us are dominated by by                                 software people should not be forced                                 neither                                 individuals nor organizations nor                                 companies nor government's should be                                 forced to use the software in a way the                                 developer decided them to do and change                                 the processes accordingly but you should                                 always be allowed to make modifications                                 and make the software help you in what                                 you want to achieve                                 ask others to help you with this so you                                 can always adopt the software you're                                 always allowed to extend it further if                                 you don't agree with the general parts                                 of the software you can make your own                                 modifications and go complete different                                 way from there on and you can make you                                 can also get by repair things out there                                 so and that's that's always was                                 something overall thirty-five five years                                 always came back to it that this is the                                 common base we can agree on and so I                                 mean it's it's an often there's the                                 question of okay but free software                                 doesn't solve this problem or free                                 software doesn't solve this other                                 problem and that's why it's important                                 for us to remember that free software                                 and software freedom what what we have                                 here it's one tool for one piece of the                                 puzzle so there are many problems out                                 there which where you need other things                                 as well to fix it there might be a                                 meaning if we stay in technology we can                                 talk about open hardware we can talk                                 about open data we can talk about                                 privacy we can and so on about all                                 different aspects and a lot of aspects                                 there they are important to achieve                                 certain goals in society and have                                 certain outcomes so free software and a                                 lot of problems people see it's a it's a                                 necessity but it's not enough to fix the                                 problem and instead of instead of                                 thinking about okay what else do we have                                 to add to free software to software                                 freedom we just think about the old UNIX                                 philosophy have one tool for one problem                                 and don't overload it with all kind of                                 other things so that's I think that's                                 often good to remember that we have this                                 we have software freedom it's fixing a                                 few things and it's fixing those good                                 but we should consider for other parts                                 which we see in society other problems                                 we see if we have to combine it with                                 other tools out there in the way we                                 think it's it's fitting so there is                                 still a very long way ahead of us if we                                 want to make sure that software freedom                                 is a                                 fold out there there are many many areas                                 where software freedom is meanwhile the                                 default but there are many areas where                                 it's not the case and some areas where                                 it was the case before they might at                                 certain points change a little bit and                                 then you again have things where it was                                 a common that you could use free                                 software for it and and it's it's not                                 common anymore and you you have the                                 problem that you are confronted with                                 proprietary software again and for this                                 it's I think it's good to always remind                                 ourself about how such changes in                                 society are happening also in other                                 areas like if we compare it software                                 freedom with the freedom of the press we                                 people were working for that for                                 hundreds of years and they were they                                 were many several people they had very                                 bad effects they had to suffer because                                 they were working for that and some many                                 people they they died for it and when                                 you once have it in society is also                                 doesn't stop there you have to                                 constantly defend those those rights the                                 freedom of the press and so there they                                 are often changes there and even if mean                                 if you go out now and in the world and                                 ask people is freedom of the press                                 important you have a large maybe yeah                                 you have you have many people here in                                 Europe many people who say yes that's                                 important how much they send up for that                                 is another question and if you take the                                 rest of the world it's a question how                                 many people day I will say it's                                 important and that they would do                                 something about it so and and that's                                 something where people were working for                                 hundreds of years already now if you                                 compare that to software freedom where                                 we're working for                                                       put that in a in a perspective there so                                 there will be many many more decades to                                 come and because of that it's important                                 to focus there that you don't get                                 distracted from many many other problems                                 in our society in this movement and                                 think that we should also try to fix                                 this and this and this and in the end I                                 believe that if if you try to do                                 something like this and try to fix                                 everything at once you                                 in the end not achieve any of those                                 goals so that's why I think it's                                 important that as software freedom                                 movement to focus focus on those values                                 which we which we defined at the                                 beginning and which also we came back to                                 to to compare that with yeah with one                                 own activity of myself I also have some                                 other values beside software freedom and                                 so I'm active in a Wilderness First Aid                                 group and I don't want people to have                                 severe injuries or died because of the                                 lack of proper preparation when they do                                 outdoor activities I think a lot of them                                 can be prevented by a good training and                                 I'm part of a group of others who also                                 things that this is possible and we want                                 to achieve that now if I start                                 discussing with them about software                                 freedom that's a different topic and                                 some of them they don't care about that                                 some think it's not that important some                                 are really huge fans of some proprietary                                 software out there and it's sometimes                                 bit difficult if you have a belief in                                 one area and then you work with people                                 on something you also believe in but you                                 are sometimes yeah you encounter there                                 was those other beliefs where it's it's                                 not matching with yours and still I'm                                 doing this because I believe that when I                                 want to achieve this one goal of mine in                                 this case to prevent injuries or deaths                                 in outdoor activities I can achieve that                                 by working together with a group who                                 also believes in this and I will work                                 with people like you on the software                                 freedom issues that's also I think that                                 it's it's difficult in in such a                                 movement if you try to have too many                                 different things where you have to agree                                 on if we take the three questions from                                 the beginning and everybody has to agree                                 on those how many less people would be                                 be in the movement or like now in the                                 room if all of them that will be very                                 less                                 and it's important that we have many                                 people there so just just to clarify                                 this this one point and I talked about                                 the values of the movement author of the                                 software freedom movement I don't mean                                 that this is equal to the well use                                 organizations have in this field so                                 there are many organizations who have                                 additional values beside that people                                 should be allowed to use study share and                                 improve software we as fsfe we also have                                 other well use there are some of them                                 are written down in our Constitution                                 some of them are they were important to                                 the founders of this or some are through                                 the work of people who contribute their                                 it's it's friends product it's not                                 written down and all of this is in it's                                 influencing us and and we have other                                 well use there as well but they are not                                 we don't have those values because we                                 are a free software organization but a                                 lot of them rather because we are                                 European organization from people                                 growing up here in this culture with a                                 certain background certain education so                                 that that's more influencing this than                                 that it's a free software organization                                 and I encourage people to think about it                                 if when you have a movement and also                                 groups how how many believes do people                                 have to agree to to work with you on                                 this issues and how many of the other                                 beliefs can you work with others and                                 when do you have to split up                                 how large is your group to to make a                                 change there and so I I think it's                                 important that many many people it's                                 it's nests it's necessary that many                                 people are working together for software                                 freedom around the world if we want to                                 make software freedom of default it's                                 not just as here in the room we need to                                 have many many people around the world                                 who are following us there and SD SD we                                 will grow there                                 I mean free software movement already                                 crow over the last years by many many                                 people many more countries way more                                 diverse from from backgrounds from the                                 companies of different companies were                                 against us before then                                 many governments who didn't care about                                 it before and so it's it's growing and                                 growing and that's important that this                                 is happening but it also means that                                 because of this there will be more                                 diversity more than we already have now                                 so there will be people from countries                                 who have completely different education                                 than we have a complete different                                 cultural background than we have so this                                 will also challenge how to be respectful                                 to others I mean you see how some of the                                 debates are at the moment happening                                 about questions I mentioned before so                                 that's something where yeah it you will                                 be challenging your beliefs and how to                                 be respectful to others but it's                                 important that we that we stay                                 respectful and work together with the                                 others to achieve our common goal and                                 finally the other part which is                                 important is that we focus as a free                                 software movement that we don't try to                                 fix everything at once but that we focus                                 on what this is about what it was                                 started for what what you can fix with                                 software freedom and focus on those                                 parts that you are that we want to                                 enable people to use software for any                                 purpose to study how it works to share                                 it with others and to finally then also                                 make improvements and adopt it to your                                 needs so yes that's that's it from my                                 side at the moment thank you very much                                 and I'm looking forward to have                                 discussions with you over the day thank                                 you                                 you                                 and questions don't be shy yeah thank                                 you for the talk it's great I have a                                 question you mentioned there was a point                                 where you had these discussions over and                                 over again about you know not allowing                                 military use of software or the use of                                 software and was there some turning                                 point recently or was there ever at some                                 point or does this cover this discussion                                 still come up just curious about that                                 the discussion is coming up repeatedly                                 so I mean that the last point I think                                 were worried where there was some in                                 Germany now some more discussion was I                                 think two years ago also at chaos                                 communication congress this topic came                                 up it's often I mean when whenever there                                 is a military conflict somewhere                                 it comes up or when someone finds out                                 that the software they they wrote is                                 used by the military or by intelligence                                 services by the police by border control                                 by some of other institutions where                                 people don't agree with then it's coming                                 up again I mean you also see it now with                                 border control you you saw it with                                 intelligence services very the software                                 was reused in some in some spyware so                                 this then comes up regularly and also                                 around the globe in different different                                 contexts                                 and I mean it's it's also a I think it's                                 also good that this discussion comes up                                 because for for many years programmers                                 were not aware about social implications                                 of their work and it's important that                                 you think about what what what what your                                 responsibilities in society is when you                                 are writing software and you are                                 providing tools and what can be done                                 with that you should not just say yeah I                                 don't care what what people do with my                                 with my software and I                                 I can understand that people then try to                                 limit this in a software license also I                                 don't agree that this is the best way to                                 actually achieve that you can you can                                 follow your beliefs in this area but                                 it's a good thing that that we have more                                 discussions about what is good use or                                 ethical use of our technology so that's                                 that's something which should be                                 encouraged and also talk about what can                                 you do to prevent this can you already                                 write a software in a way that it's very                                 difficult to use it for for bad purposes                                 in your view or do you agree in your                                 community from the beginning and also                                 codify that may be how you want to work                                 with certain groups out there if you all                                 agree that you don't want the military                                 to use the tool to kill people with                                 drones maybe it's good that you have                                 some common understanding about it and                                 don't help them when they ask questions                                 when they have back fixes feature                                 requests and so on so that it's a good                                 discussion that we that this is this is                                 happening                                 thanks Matias um question do you perhaps                                 see an area where free software will be                                 challenged in a sense where you're when                                 you do a comparison let's say to freedom                                 of the press and then you have say                                 WikiLeaks for example where that's being                                 challenged and say the US or something                                 is there anything that you kind of see                                 that could happen with free software and                                 legal aspects going forward and you know                                 governments per se can't be prosecuted                                 on these things but they can make the                                 rules so I find that there we haven't                                 reached that point but I'm sure our case                                 will probably come forward that'll                                 challenge free software I mean free                                 software was challenged many times                                 before they were challenges that that                                 companies were challenging is other                                 are those licenses valid do certain                                 programmers have to write that they can                                 they can ask people when you make                                 modifications to give back your your                                 contributions as a company like with                                 copyleft licensing we saw that many                                 times that companies were challenging                                 that there are there are other                                 challenges where people now try also I                                 mean that is a copyright is already one                                 copy left is already one tool which is                                 added there to to prevent those values                                 but it's already very only on the                                 borderline of how much power developer                                 should have over other developers and                                 and users and that was something which                                 till now was by many is found acceptable                                 for some areas but it's it's something                                 which is still challenged they're like                                 how how how far should that go and they                                 are at the moment licenses which are                                 brought up there were people say oh                                 that's too much or let me say maybe                                 so that's something where ever will be                                 definitely challenged and beside that                                 you you have other challenges                                 technological challenges that things are                                 changing from you have your computer                                 everything all the software is running                                 on the computer - the software is                                 running somewhere else or all those                                 devices around us have have software in                                 there so that's also come often changing                                 because that was not what not a                                 situation where when these values were                                 defined where we are in and so there's                                 constant you have to think about how to                                 how dispense first with some changes                                 there did that answer your question or                                 kind of sorta but you know I'm thinking                                 like you have for example for in the                                 press and a lot of constitutions where                                 where is that gonna be with you know                                 when you do have a legal challenge okay                                 and and you're talking about rights okay                                 yeah I I think now I understand it                                 better so I                                 I mean all freedoms you have in a                                 society they are not absolute and you                                 always have to balance them like freedom                                 of the press is also balanced by you are                                 not allowed to put something in your                                 paper which is violating other people's                                 right rights other rights we have in our                                 society and with software freedom it's                                 also something that software license and                                 and from the software peace freedom                                 perspective you might say you can do                                 anything with it but the law will say                                 you're not allowed to do this no matter                                 if you use software for it or not and                                 they might also restrict like what what                                 you are allowed to do with certain with                                 certain software and on the other hand                                 is it's also possible in the world how                                 it's developing at the moment that there                                 are also some restrictions that that                                 governments will restrict people who                                 want to make software proprietary                                 because they say it's such an important                                 component in our society it's important                                 that people can have a debate if it's if                                 this software is sending you to jail or                                 not that we have a debate if that rules                                 implemented in there are right or wrong                                 so it's also possible that there people                                 cannot decide is something free software                                 or not                                 but the government will will say this                                 and there will be because of the                                 internationality of software development                                 there will be many many conflicts ahead                                 of us and debates you made a very                                 compelling case that licenses are not                                 the right tool to enforce ethical use of                                 software now I don't think we can ignore                                 that it's a problem if software is used                                 in a non ethical way and software is                                 becoming very dominant so what are your                                 thoughts about what would be the right                                 tool to enforce an ethical use of                                 software or create a better environment                                 which makes this more easy something                                 that the first thing is that for me                                 software freedom is ethical and it's                                 it's it's another ethic then some other                                 people people's ethics but it's a very                                 ethical thing it's actually it was so                                 ethical and so                                 political when the free-software                                 movement started that a few years later                                 there was a marketing term which was                                 invented to take away those ethical                                 beliefs and and rather sell it sell it                                 better so the term open source' was                                 mainly coined because it was too ethical                                 for the venture capitalists in the in                                 the Silicon Valley                                 so did there is a lot of ethics there                                 it's it's just different than some of                                 the debates we we have at the moment                                 it's difficult to answer that question                                 because I think that depending on what                                 problems you are looking at the                                 solutions are completely different I                                 think I mean there there are there are                                 so there are problems out there where                                 you need to change laws where you need                                 to change international laws you will                                 from my perspective not fix the the                                 problem of of these huge monopolies                                 which we which we see out there in the                                 tech world by creating a new licence you                                 you have to think about how how to                                 change laws how to regulate markets or                                 yeah I mean for for certain problems                                 people see so it's also possible that I                                 mean there are other people say it's not                                 a problem at all so that is that's the                                 thing that there are so many people who                                 have so different perceptions of power                                 problems that also then does the                                 solutions are so different so I mean I                                 for me it's always always good to to                                 remember those those points which                                 Lawrence Lessig was making about how how                                 people are regulated you have laws you                                 have social norms I mean by by not                                 accepting something and making sure that                                 a lot of people don't accept certain                                 behavior it's also a lot of influence                                 you not always have to change the law if                                 in a community you have certain                                 standards they are not written down but                                 but they are still it's it's considered                                 impolite to to to not adhere to them                                 that's also very powerful tool it takes                                 a very long time to change social norms                                 often then to change laws but still in                                 some smaller groups it's it's it can                                 happen faster beside that yes markets I                                 mean you you can change markets and you                                 also for as I said before even when you                                 who spent more money on buying free                                 software than you spent on buying                                 proprietary software if a lot of people                                 are doing this this has an influence and                                 the last part which which lesyk always                                 mentioned is yeah architecture code I                                 mean when as a programmer you decide to                                 write certain software or not to write                                  certain software which is then                                  influencing what people can do and what                                  you empower them to do that that has a                                  huge effect if certain software is out                                  there                                  okay now reminded about iPhone if you                                  have software where everybody can can                                  just use that to set up a network that's                                  making a huge impact on society and you                                  you have an effect where it's easy for                                  people to do that if on the other hand                                  it's it's widely distributed software to                                  harm people                                  you also have an effect so if the main                                  purpose for the software is to harm                                  people so I think those those four                                  things it's it's always you you have to                                  think about that you have to find                                  innovative ideas I think with software                                  freedom we found an innovative idea in                                  one area at that point at that point of                                  time and nowadays as I said you have                                  problems which are way more complex out                                  there in society and software is often                                  of one piece of that it's often                                  necessary and necessity to solve a                                  problem but there are many things around                                  that which which also need and where I                                  don't want to answer the question what                                  is the right tool for that or not they                                  are very more clever people for other                                  areas who will have to think about that                                  ok we have time for one more question                                  over here hi thanks Ann for your talk I                                  agree with everything you say just                                  because of the discussion which now came                                  kind of up I wanted to point out that                                  there is something like export control                                  laws which a lot of people never think                                  about because while open source and the                                  licenses allow your everything to do it                                  doesn't mean you're allowed to do                                  everything you want to do because                                  there's still other rights and                                  so just for an example there's some                                  restrictions on like everything which is                                  military or dual use if you're like                                  where you are like to share it or to                                  publish it so while the license allows                                  you to share your stuff was everybody it                                  might be that you're not allowed to put                                  it somewhere just on the internet                                  without any precautions depending on                                  what you're doing and so I think there                                  are some and this shows that there are                                  some ways to find agreements and ethical                                  stuff because there's some like                                  regarding mass destruction as a weapons                                  of mass destruction stuff that you're                                  not allowed to do something like that so                                  if somebody heard right open-source                                  software about something like that they                                  wouldn't be allowed to publish it                                  brightly on the internet without getting                                  in trouble so I just say there's there's                                  already stuff and place might be for the                                  really critical stuff but yeah yeah it                                  it depends so I I would say I mean first                                  yes that the big difference here is that                                  with free software it's the question is                                  like should a programmer be allowed to                                  make such rules for the rest of society                                  I mean programmers already in a very                                  powerful position because they are                                  creating all those tools so should they                                  also be allowed to restrict even further                                  what people can and cannot do through                                  such such rules that that's that's one                                  question or should that happen like you                                  said like with governments making laws                                  like export rules but my aside it                                  depends is that's true for for Germany                                  that's maybe also true for some other                                  countries in Europe but I'm pretty sure                                  that there are countries around the                                  world where some of the things you                                  mentioned nobody will have a problem                                  with that and it might become a problem                                  if they see that it has a negative                                  effect on them or if they have a problem                                  for justifying their power but that's                                  that's the thing that nowadays with with                                  software freedom the software freedom                                  movement it's so large and there are                                  people from so many people countries                                  around the world and people using                                  software where some of the users of the                                  software are actually institutions which                                  the export law for prohibits you to give                                  it to them which many people would say                                  it's a good thing but it's not something                                  which is regulated by a software freedom                                  and so that that's yeah but but very                                  good point thank you okay thank you for                                  that there was a great talk                                  [Applause]                                  you
